Our knowledge about it has recently deepened dramatically. However  the significance of NMDAR antibodies in psychiatric disease cannot be determined if there are no clear indications of brain inflammation or an autoimmune encephalitis mediated by NMDAR antibodies. Furthermore  the long-term interaction and connection between these two disease entities are unclear. In this paper we aim to elucidate the relationship between these disease entities. We propose two distinct models that explain the on the one hand a condition in which a minor inflammatory state as in psychiatric disease culminates in a severe state of inflammation characterized by NMDAR encephalitis. On the other hand  we postulate a model in which an NMDAR encephalitis might later create favorable conditions for inducing psychiatric disease. These models should be kept in mind for further investigations examining the long-term outcome of NMDAR autoantibody immunity in the brain and its functions."

There is a scarcity of research focusing on the biological brain changes caused by the cancer due to the assumption that psychological symptoms are solely caused by the stress of a cancer diagnosis. Recent clinical evidence indicates that declines in cognition and increases in mood symptoms occur prior to an individual receiving a cancer diagnosis  suggesting that the cancer itself may play a role in mediating biological brain change. Furthermore  the presence of a tumour may change the brain response to environmental stressors unrelated to a cancer diagnosis. Using a syngeneic  orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer  we compared the impact of mammary tumours and chronic restraint stress on microglial and astrocytic activation throughout stress-relevant neurocircuitry. We also examined whether changes in microglial and astrocytic activation overlapped with changes in chronic neuronal activity. We show that cancer and chronic restraint stress activates microglia to the same magnitude in the same subcortical brain regions  and that this activation correlates with stress coping behaviours. The findings suggest that in some cancer patients  microglia may be activated in brain regions involved in interpreting and responding to psychological distress before they are aware of their diagnosis. In contrast  cancer reduced astrocyte reactivity in two cortical brain regions where there were no clear changes in response to chronic restraint stress. Taken together  it is likely that interventions that aim to improve anxiety and stress in cancer patients by targeting glial responses to cancer would need to be cell-specific; reducing microglial activation and/or stimulating astrocytic activation."
"3","36170741",2022,"Immunopsychiatry of Infected Ears, Sinuses, Skulls, and Meninges: Mast Cells, Mozart, Van Gogh.","Medical psychiatry acquires more prominence in the biological field by new anatomical insights into the wrappings of the brain: meninges  but also Meningo-Calvarial Channels (MCCs) connecting the former with the bone marrows' also neuronally steered  functions. The skull-bone's meningeal arteries through migrating and orchestrating mast cells within a framework stressing their relations with arteries (Treviranus 2012-21) could explain enigmatic phenomena like migrainous and post-injury Cortical Spreading Depressions (CSD) or the Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) escalating to ""PRES"". The skull might be accessed along chronic (para-)infectious paths resulting in Skull Bone Osteomyelitis (SBO) from the ear-nose-throat  dental and other microbiomes. Such paths seem promoted by compromised innate immune defenses: by ""Mendelian"" susceptibility  and/or acquired anti-INF-Î³- or other auto-immunity or various microbial ""Trojans"" of e. g. meningeal myelo- and lymphocytes. These interact e. g. from the calvarial marrow niches onward. Hereby competing local and ""intentional"" intruding mast cells - by disturbing (or ingeniously boosting) cortical development and functioning - acquire relevance by interacting with arteries (Treviranus 2018  2021). This predicts findings in behavior (Fitzpatrick & Morrow 2017) an ""aortal"" arterial biomechanical foundation of parasympathetic reverse arterio-intramural cerebro-interstitial drainage by CIMURAF/IPAD-2.0 (Treviranus 2018-21). Here the recent physiological re-conceptions of the skull illuminate own case histories through a gamut of possibly relevant neuro(-surgico)-psychiatric challenges. Among these meningo-cerebral immune  vasospastic  and cystic processes some generate broad ""experiential"" hallucinations  which may slowly transit to true psychoses through ""perfect crime lesions"" of neurons and glia by tryptase-armed mast cells descending into parenchyma often congested by ""push-back"". These emerging hypotheses coalesce in advancing an integrative macro-medical psychiatry and even the pathography of Van Gogh and Mozart stressing the benign and creative roles of mast cells."

Most dietary studies have been limited by small sample sizes and rarely assess the heterogeneity of autism. Addressing this gap  this study compared the anthropometrics  dietary composition  dietary quality  and food variety of 154 Australian children and adolescents on the spectrum and 213 non-autistic children (71 siblings and 142 unrelated controls). Beyond the case-control approach  within-group comparisons assessed the influence of autism clinical presentations and sensory processing styles on body mass index (BMI) and measures of dietary intake among those on the spectrum. In this word first study of diet that included between-group comparisons with non-autistic peers (siblings and an unrelated comparison group) and within-autism group comparisons  we found that children on the spectrum consumed limited variety and lower quality of food and non-autistic siblings also ate comparably higher levels of energy-dense  nutrient poor food  and less diary. This may be due to autistic traits influencing family's diets or shared sensory sensitivities driving dietary intake. Within the autism group  higher autistic traits were associated with lower BMIs and a specific dietary pattern higher in simple carbohydrates and lower in unprocessed protein. Contrastingly  greater sensitivity to sensory stimuli was associated with a healthier diet. Increased age was linked to more varied diets but also diets higher in saturated fats and energy-dense  nutrient poor foods. Overall  this research highlights that potential mediators of dietary intake  such as familial influences  autistic traits  sensory processing styles  age and sex  need to be considered when assessing diet in the autistic population. LAY SUMMARY: In this study of dietary differences linked to autism  children  and teenagers on the spectrum ate fewer different foods and were less likely to eat recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables when compared to non-autistic siblings and unrelated children and teenagers. There were also family differences  in that those on the spectrum and their siblings ate more unhealthy foods and less dairy. Among those on the spectrum  dietary differences were linked to age  sex  autistic traits and sensory processing styles."

This review aims to describe recent novel technological developments for improving diagnostics in the field of autoantibody-related psychiatric disease. We screened for relevant articles in PubMed for this narrative article. We focused on research methods such as neuroimaging  immune cells and inflammation markers  and molecular biomarkers in human biofluids like serum and cerebrospinal fluid and plasma proteomics. We introduce several novel methods for investigating autoinflammation with the aim of optimizing therapies for autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease. We describe measuring the translocator protein 18kDa in activated microglia via positron emission tomography imaging  brain volumetric assessment  flow cell cytometry of cerebrospinal fluid and blood  and blood biological probes as well as psychopathological cues to help us gain insights into diagnosing inflammation and brain damage better in psychiatric patients presenting a suspected autoimmune etiology. Our short methodological review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of autoantibody-related immunopsychiatry. More research is needed to prove their usefulness in diagnosing and treating autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease and its subtypes."
"6","35492247",2022,"Autoantibodies against NCAM1 from patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice.","From genetic and etiological studies  autoimmune mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are suspected; however  the details remain unclear. In this study  we describe autoantibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) in patients with schizophrenia (5.4%  cell-based assay; 6.7%  ELISA) in a Japanese cohort (nÂ = 223). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody disrupts both NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interactions. Furthermore  the anti-NCAM1 antibody purified from patients with schizophrenia interrupts NCAM1-Fyn interaction and inhibits phosphorylation of FAK  MEK1  and ERK1 when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice and also reduces the number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex. In addition  it induces schizophrenia-related behavior in mice  including deficient pre-pulse inhibition and cognitive impairment. In conclusion  anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice. These antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target and serve as a biomarker to distinguish a small but treatable subgroup in heterogeneous patients with schizophrenia."

"9","35199050",2022,"Disrupting circadian rhythms promotes cancer-induced inflammation in mice.","Disruption of circadian rhythms occurs in rotating shift-work  jetlag  and in individuals with irregular sleep schedules. Circadian disruption is known to alter inflammatory responses and impair immune function. However  there is limited understanding of how circadian disruption modulates cancer-induced inflammation. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and is linked to worse prognosis and impaired brain function in cancer patients. Here  we investigated the effect of circadian disruption on cancer-induced inflammation in an orthotopic breast cancer model. Using a validated chronic jetlag protocol that advances the light-cycle by 8Â âh every 2 days to disrupt circadian rhythms  we found that circadian disruption alters cancer-induced inflammation in a tissue-specific manner  increasing inflammation in the body and brain while decreasing inflammation within the tumor tissue. Circadian disruption did not affect inflammation in mice without tumors  suggesting that the impact of circadian disruption may be particularly detrimental in the context of underlying inflammatory conditions  such as cancer. Importantly  circadian disruption did not affect tumor burden  suggesting that increased inflammation was not a result of increased cancer progression. Overall  these findings identify the importance of healthy circadian rhythms for limiting cancer-induced inflammation."
"10","35199049",2022,"The role of yoga in inflammatory markers.","Yoga is an ancient system for integrating the mind  body  and spirit. In the  hatha  yoga  ashtanga  tradition (the eight limb Patanjali Yoga)  three of the limbs are meditation  breathwork ( pranayama ) and physical postures ( asana)   which are widely practised in yoga classes. The benefits of yoga for mental and physical health are rooted in the practice's origins: in yoga  stress is said to be the root of all diseases. The established fields of psychoneuroimmunology and immunopsychiatry study the interplay between the immune system and mood or mental states. This mini-review has shifted the emphasis from research that focuses on yoga's benefits for stress  the most commonly studied outcome of yoga research  to a summary of the research on the effects of yoga practices on the immune system. The current literature bears strong evidence for the benefits of yoga on the levels of circulating cortisol and classical inflammatory markers  such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²)  interleukin 6 (IL-6)  tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and interferon-gamma (INF-Î³). The evidence for other less studied markers  telomerase activity  Î²-endorphins  Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also growing. This mini-review centres around the interplay between yoga and these markers in stress management and depression  vascular and immune function in the older population  cardiovascular and metabolic diseases  auto-immune diseases  breast cancer and pregnancy. Overall  the literature examined reveals the novelty of this field of research and sheds light on methodological challenges; however  it uncovers the potential for yoga to be used as adjuvant therapy in conditions with an inflammatory component."
"11","35130814",2022,"Immunopsychiatry: an update on autoimmune encephalitis for neuropsychiatrists.","Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a group of immune-mediated inflammatory processes of the brain with marked psychiatric features. Although relatively rare  they might offer difficult differential diagnosis with psychiatric conditions  especially catatonia and psychotic syndromes. Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common AIE  presenting with psychiatric syndromes in 90% of cases. The associated psychopathology is complex  pleomorphic  and best characterized when there is involvement of a psychiatrist in the assessment. This text will review the main aspects of AIE to psychiatrists and/or neuropsychiatrists. Immune system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms and disorders. The use of diagnostic criteria for possible AIE  especially when specific antibodies of AIE are not available  allows early diagnosis and prompt treatment which are associated with better clinical outcomes. The study of the psychiatric aspects of AIE can broaden our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of various psychiatric manifestations."

Cognitive impairment induced by cancer-related inflammation and stress-related psychiatric symptoms may be underlying mechanisms. We therefore studied the association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of these outcomes. Following a cohort of 388 443 cancer patients diagnosed between October 2005 and December 2014 in Sweden  we ascertained dispense of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before cancer diagnosis onward and defined the on-medication period as from date of drug dispense until the prescribed dosage was consumed. Follow-up time outside medicated periods and time from unexposed patients were defined as off-medication periods. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death due to suicide or accident  by comparing the on-medication periods with off-medication periods. In total  29.7% of the cancer patients had low-dose aspirin dispensed and 29.1% had non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed. Patients with aspirin use were more likely to be male than patients without aspirin use. Compared with off-medication periods  there was a 22% lower risk of accidental death (Nâ=â651; HR 0.78  95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 to 0.87) during on-medication periods with aspirin. The use of aspirin was not associated with risk of suicide (Nâ=â59; HR 0.96  95% CI: 0.66 to 1.39). No association was noted between use of non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of suicide (Nâ=â13; HR 0.95  95% CI: 0.42 to 2.18) or accidental death (Nâ=â59; HR 0.92  95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26). Intake of low-dose aspirin after cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of unnatural deaths among cancer patients."
"13","34972034",2022,"Choroid plexus enlargement is associated with neuroinflammation and reduction of blood brain barrier permeability in depression.","Recent studies have shown that choroid plexuses (CP) may be involved in the neuro-immune axes  playing a role in the interaction between the central and peripheral inflammation. Here we aimed to investigate CP volume alterations in depression and their associations with inflammation. 51 depressed participants (HDRS scoreÂ >Â 13) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) from the Wellcome Trust NIMA consortium were re-analysed for the study. All the participants underwent full peripheral cytokine profiling and simultaneous [11C]PK11195 PET/structural MRI imaging for measuring neuroinflammation and CP volume respectively. We found a significantly greater CP volume in depressed subjects compared to HCs (t (76)  = +2.17) that was positively correlated with [ 11 C]PK11195 PET binding in the anterior cingulate cortex (rÂ =Â 0.28  pÂ =Â 0.02)  prefrontal cortex (rÂ =Â 0.24  pÂ =Â 0.04)  and insular cortex (rÂ =Â 0.24  pÂ =Â 0.04)  but not with the peripheral inflammatory markers: CRP levels (rÂ =Â 0.07  pÂ =Â 0.53)  IL-6 (rÂ =Â -0.08  pÂ =Â 0.61)  and TNF-Î± (rÂ =Â -0.06  pÂ =Â 0.70). The CP volume correlated with the [ 11 C]PK11195 PET binding in CP (rÂ =Â 0.34  pÂ =Â 0.005). Integration of transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas with the brain map depicting the correlations between CP volume and PET imaging found significant gene enrichment for several pathways involved in neuroinflammatory response. This result supports the hypothesis that changes in brain barriers may cause reduction in solute exchanges between blood and CSF  disturbing the brain homeostasis and ultimately contributing to inflammation in depression. Given that CP anomalies have been recently detected in other brain disorders  these results may not be specific to depression and might extend to other conditions with a peripheral inflammatory component."

However  the speed and simplicity of POCTs also makes their use appealing to clinicians in high-income countries (HICs)  despite greater laboratory accessibility. Although also part of the clinical routine in HICs  clinician perceptions of the utility of POCTs are relatively unknown in such settings as compared with others. In a Swedish paediatric emergency department (PED) where POCT use is routine  we aimed to characterise healthcare providers' perspectives on the clinical utility of POCTs and explore their implementation in the local setting; to discuss and compare such perspectives  to those reported in other settings; and finally  to gather requests for ideal novel POCTs. Qualitative focus group discussions study. A data-driven content analysis approach was used for analysis. The PED of a secondary paediatric hospital in Stockholm  Sweden. Twenty-four healthcare providers clinically active at the PED were enrolled in six focus groups. A range of POCTs was routinely used. The emerging theme  Utility of our POCT use is double-edged  illustrated the perceived utility of POCTs. While POCT services were considered to have clinical and social value  the local routine for their use was named to distract clinicians from the care for patients. Requests were made for ideal POCTs and their implementation. Despite their clinical integration  deficient implementation routines limit the benefits of POCT services to this well-resourced paediatric clinic. As such deficiencies are shared with other settings  it is suggested that some characteristics of POCTs and of their utility are less related to resource level and more to policy deficiency. To address this  we propose the appointment of skilled laboratory personnel as ambassadors to hospital clinics offering POCT services  to ensure higher utility of such services."

When followed up 2Â weeks after MIS-C was diagnosed  43% of the 119 patients had abnormal results  including complete blood cell counts  platelet counts  albumin levels  electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. After 8Â weeks  36% of 89 had an abnormal patient history  but clinical findings were uncommon. Echocardiogram results were abnormal in 5% of 67  and the most common complaint was fatigue. Older children and those who received intensive care were more likely to report symptoms and have abnormal cardiac results. More than a third (36%) of the patients had persistent symptoms 8Â weeks after MIS-C  and 5% had abnormal echocardiograms. Older age and higher levels of initial care appeared to be risk factors. Structured follow-up visits are important after MIS-C."

These interactions play important roles in health from supporting neural development  homeostasis and plasticity to modifying behaviour. Neuroimmunology is increasingly recognised as a field with the potential to deliver a significant positive impact on human health and treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet  translation to the clinic is hindered by fundamental knowledge gaps on the underlying mechanisms of action or the optimal timing of an intervention  and a lack of appropriate tools to visualise and modulate both systems. Here we propose ten key disease-agnostic research questions that  if addressed  could lead to significant progress within neuroimmunology in the short to medium term. We also discuss four cross-cutting themes to be considered when addressing each question: i) bi-directionality of neuroimmune interactions; ii) the biological context in which the questions are addressed (e.g. health vs disease vs across the lifespan); iii) tools and technologies required to fully answer the questions; and iv) translation into the clinic. We acknowledge that these ten questions cannot represent the full breadth of gaps in our understanding; rather they focus on areas which  if addressed  may have the most broad and immediate impacts. By defining these neuroimmunology priorities  we hope to unite existing and future research teams  who can make meaningful progress through a collaborative and cross-disciplinary effort."
"20","34668170",2021,"Toward the unity of pathological and exertional fatigue: A predictive processing model.","Fatigue is a common experience in both health and disease. Yet  pathological (i.e.  prolonged or chronic) and transient (i.e.  exertional) fatigue symptoms are traditionally considered distinct  compounding a separation between interested research fields within the study of fatigue. Within the clinical neurosciences  nascent frameworks position pathological fatigue as a product of inference derived through hierarchical predictive processing. The metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al.  2016) states that pathological fatigue emerges from the metacognitive mechanism in which the detection of persistent mismatches between prior interoceptive predictions and ascending sensory evidence (i.e.  prediction error) signals low evidence for internal generative models  which undermine an agent's feeling of mastery over the body and is thus experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Although acute  transient subjective symptoms of exertional fatigue haveÂ also been associated with increasing interoceptive prediction error  the dynamic computations that underlie its development have not been clearly defined. Here  drawing on the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis  we extend this account to offer an explicit description of the development of fatigue during extended periods of (physical) exertion. Accordingly  it is proposed that a loss of certainty or confidence in control predictions in response to persistent detection of prediction error features as a common foundation for the conscious experience of both pathological and nonpathological fatigue."

In this paper  we will comment on four types of immune variables which have been studied in psychiatric disorders: Acute Phase Proteins (AAPs)  cytokines  lipid mediators of inflammation and immune cell parameters  and discuss the rationale for looking at them in blood.

We explored inter-correlations between the measures and used intraclass correlation coefficients to evaluate the agreement between clinician-  parent- and child ratings of the same constructs. Ratings on symptom-specific measures varied largely between participants. Agreement between informants was excellent on functional scales  fair-to-moderate on global severity scales and mixed on symptom-specific scales. Clinician-rated global and functional measures had stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than with symptom-specific measures. General instruments assessing global severity and functioning are well suited for the assessment and follow-up of PANS  but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of core symptoms."

We aimed to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality  hospitalisation  and intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental disorder  and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders  and exposure to psychopharmacological drug classes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis  we searched Web of Science  Cochrane  PubMed  and PsycINFO databases between Jan 1  2020  and March 5  2021  for original studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples  studies that were not peer-reviewed  and studies written in languages other than English  Danish  Dutch  French  German  Italian  and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection as the primary outcome  and hospitalisation and ICU admission as secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2  statistic  and publication bias was tested with Egger regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting  patient age  country  pandemic phase  quality assessment score  sample sizes  and adjustment for confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO  CRD42021233984. 841 studies were identified by the systematic search  of which 33 studies were included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis  comprising 1â469â731 patients with COVID-19  of whom 43â938 had mental disorders. The sample included 130â807 females (8Â·9% of the whole sample) and 130â373 males (8Â·8%). Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity  and 22 studies were rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 2Â·00 [95% CI 1Â·58-2Â·54]; I 2 =92Â·66%). This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (2Â·05 [1Â·37-3Â·06]; I 2 =80Â·81%)  mood disorders (1Â·99 [1Â·46-2Â·71]; I 2 =68Â·32%)  substance use disorders (1Â·76 [1Â·27-2Â·44]; I 2 =47Â·90%)  and intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (1Â·73 [1Â·29-2Â·31]; I 2 =90Â·15%) but not for anxiety disorders (1Â·07 [0Â·73-1Â·56]; I 2 =11Â·05%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with exposure to antipsychotics (3Â·71 [1Â·74-7Â·91]; I 2 =90Â·31%)  anxiolytics (2Â·58 [1Â·22-5Â·44]; I 2 =96Â·42%)  and antidepressants (2Â·23 [1Â·06-4Â·71]; I 2 =95Â·45%). For psychotic disorders  mood disorders  antipsychotics  and anxiolytics  the association remained significant after adjustment for age  sex  and other confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (2Â·24 [1Â·70-2Â·94]; I 2 =88Â·80%). No significant associations with mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting (p=0Â·013) and country (p<0Â·0001) with mortality. No significant associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude mortality and hospitalisation  and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission. Pre-existing mental disorders  in particular psychotic and mood disorders  and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models.

"27","34153835",2021,"Neuroinflammation in Major Depressive Disorder: A Review of PET Imaging Studies Examining the 18-kDa Translocator Protein.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric disorder whose pathological mechanisms are largely unknown. In the field of immuno-psychiatry  several evidences suggested a prominent role of inflammation in MDD not only in peripheral immune system but also in the brain. To date  brain inflammation is traceable in vivo with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  through the quantification of the expression of 18-kda Translocator Protein (TSPO) by active microglia. In this context  this review aimed to summarize the results of all in vivo PET imaging studies that evaluated microglia activation in MDD. A bibliographic search in PubMed up to June 2020 was performed. A total of 9 studies that used first and second generation TSPO radiotracers met our inclusion criteria. Overall the results suggested the presence of TSPO upregulation in MDD  especially in anterior cingulate cortex  prefrontal cortex  hippocampal formation and insula. Notably  from a therapeutic point of view  results suggested that the symptoms amelioration  caused by both antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy  may be accompanied by reduced inflammatory status in the brain. Finally  a positive effect of the anti-inflammatory treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor has also been observed. The heterogeneity across the studies in experimental designs  sample selection and methods limited the studies comparison. These findings supported the presence of neuroinflammation in MDD  suggesting that microgliosis may be an important pathophysiological mechanism that merits further investigation as a potential target for novel treatment strategies."

Despite the extensive research  its pathophysiology remains largely unelucidated. Currently  more attention is being given to the disease's vascular and inflammatory aspects. In this context  the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) emerges as a credible player in AD pathogenesis. The RAS has multiple physiological functions  conducted by its two opposing axes: the classical  led by Angiotensin II (Ang II)  and the alternative  driven by Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]. These peptides were shown to interact with AD pathology in animal studies  but evidence from humans is scarce. Only 20 studies dosed RAS molecules in AD patients' bloodstream  none of which assessed both axes simultaneously. Therefore  we conducted a cross-sectional  case-control exploratory study to compare plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in AD patients vs. age-matched controls. Within each group  we searched for correlations between RAS biomarkers and measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We evaluated patients with AD (n = 14) and aged-matched controls (n = 14). Plasma Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were dosed using ELISA. Brain MRI was performed in a 3 Tesla scan  and a three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric sequence was obtained. Images were then processed by FreeSurfer to calculate: (1) white matter hypointensities (WMH) volume; (2) volumes of hippocampus  medial temporal cortex  and precuneus. Statistical analyses used non-parametrical tests (Mann-Whitney and Spearman). Ang-(1-7) levels in plasma were significantly lower in the AD patients than in controls [median (25th-75th percentiles)]: AD [101.5 (62.43-126.4)] vs. controls [209.3 (72-419.1)]   p  = 0.014. There was no significant difference in circulating Ang II. In the AD patients  but not in controls  there was a positive and significant correlation between Ang-(1-7) values and WMH volumes (Spearman's rho = 0.56   p  = 0.038). Ang-(1-7) did not correlate with cortical volumes in AD or in controls. Ang II did not correlate with any MRI variable in none of the groups. If confirmed  our results strengthen the hypothesis that RAS alternative axis is downregulated in AD  and points to a possible interaction between Ang-(1-7) and cerebrovascular lesions in AD."

This review paper on the clinical applicability of TSPO PET for primary psychiatric disorders discusses if and why TSPO PET imaging might become the first clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker and the investment prerequisites and scientific advancements needed to accommodate this transition from bench to bedside. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify clinical studies of TSPO PET imaging in patients with primary psychiatric disorders. We included both original case-control studies as well as longitudinal cohort studies of patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis. Thirty-one original studies met our inclusion criteria. In the field of immunopsychiatry  TSPO PET has until now mostly been studied in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders  and to a lesser extent in mood disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantitative TSPO PET appears most promising as a predictive biomarker for the transdiagnostic identification of subgroups or disease stages that could benefit from immunological treatments  or as a prognostic biomarker forecasting patients' illness course. Current scanning protocols are still too unreliable  impractical and invasive for clinical use in symptomatic psychiatric patients. TSPO PET imaging in its present form does not yet offer a sufficiently attractive cost-benefit ratio to become a clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker. Its translation to psychiatric clinical practice will depend on the prioritising of longitudinal research and the establishment of a uniform protocol rendering clinically meaningful TSPO uptake quantification at the shortest possible scan duration without arterial cannulation."
"31","33713941",2021,"Serotonin and dopamine receptors profile on peripheral immune cells from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.","The role of inflammation and immune cells has been demonstrated in neurological diseases  including epilepsy. Leukocytes  as well as inflammatory mediators  contribute to abnormal processes that lead to a reduction in seizure threshold and synaptic reorganization. In this sense  identifying different phenotypes of circulating immune cells is essential to understanding the role of these cells in epilepsy. Immune cells can express a variety of surface markers  including neurotransmitter receptors  such as serotonin and dopamine. Alteration in these receptors expression patterns may affect the level of inflammatory mediators and the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Therefore  in the current study  we evaluated the expression of dopamine and serotonin receptors on white blood cells from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). Blood samples from 17 patients with TLE-HS and 21 controls were collected. PBMC were isolated and stained ex vivo for flow cytometry. We evaluated the expression of serotonin (5-HT 1A   5-HT 1B   5-HT 2   5-HT 2B   5-HT 2C   5-HT 3   5-HT 4 )  and dopamine receptors (D 1   D 2   D 3   D 4   and D 5 ) on the cell surface of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (monocytes and granulocytes). Our results demonstrated that innate cells and lymphocytes from patients with TLE-HS showed high mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for 5-HT 1A   5-HT 1B   5-HT 2A   and 5-HT 4  compared to controls. No difference was observed for 5-HT 2B . For dopamine receptors  the expression of D 1   D 2   D 4   and D 5  receptors was higher on innate cells from patients with TLE-HS when compared to controls for the MFI. Regarding lymphocytes population  D 2  expression was increased in patients with TLE-HS. In conclusion  there are alterations in the expression of serotonin and dopamine receptors on immune blood cells of patients with TLE-HS. Although the biological significance of these findings still needs to be further investigated  these changes may contribute to the understanding of TLE-HS pathophysiology."

Serum NMDAR antibodies have been reported in a minority of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP)  but their role in psychosis onset and response to antipsychotic treatment is unclear. Sera from 387 patients with FEP (duration of psychosis <2 years  minimally or never treated with antipsychotics) undergoing initial treatment with amisulpride as part of the OPTiMiSE (Optimization of Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in Europe) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01248195) were tested for NMDAR IgG antibodies using a live cell-based assay. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment with amisulpride. At baseline  15 patients were seropositive for NMDAR antibodies and 372 were seronegative. The seropositive patients had similar symptom profiles and demographic features to seronegative patients but a shorter duration of psychosis (median 1.5 vs. 4.0 months; pÂ = .031). Eleven seropositive and 284 seronegative patients completed 4 weeks of amisulpride treatment: after treatment  there was no between-groups difference in improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores or in the frequency of adverse medication effects. These data suggest that in FEP  NMDAR antibody seropositivity alone is not an indication for using immunotherapy instead of antipsychotic medications. Further studies are required to establish what proportion of patients with FEP who are NMDAR antibody seropositive have coexisting cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory changes or other paraclinical evidence suggestive of a likely benefit from immunotherapy."

In this perspective  the link between the immune and the nervous system  which are deeply interconnected and continuously interacting  is one of the most important novel theoretical framework to investigate the biological bases of major depressive disorder and  more in general  mental illness. Indeed  depressed patients show high levels of inflammatory markers  administration of pro-inflammatory drugs triggers a depressive symptomatology and antidepressant efficacy is reduced by excessive immune system activation. A number of molecular and cellular mechanisms have been hypothesized to act as a link between the immune and brain function  thus representing potential pharmacologically targetable processes for the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies. These include the modulation of the kynurenine pathway  the crosstalk between metabolic and inflammatory processes  the imbalance in acquired immune responses  in particular T cell responses  and the interplay between neural plasticity and immune system activation. In the personalized medicine approach  the assessment and regulation of these processes have the potential to lead  respectively  to novel diagnostic approaches for the prediction of treatment outcome according to the patient's immunological profile  and to improved efficacy of antidepressant compounds through immune modulation."

Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms  independent of all other variables modeled. However  investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e.  including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) >10Â mg/L  regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. In a sample of 3 464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset  this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite and some support for additional CRP-criterion associations. Methodologically  results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP >10Â mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Thus  we recommend considering the use of nonregularized networks in immunopsychiatry and inclusion of cases with CRP values >10Â mg/L when testing the association between CRP and depression criteria  unless contraindicated by the research question being tested. Additionally  results most consistently suggest that CRP is uniquely related to fatigue and changes in appetite  supporting their inclusion in an immunometabolic phenotype of depression. Finally  these associations suggest that fatigue and changes in appetite might be particularly receptive to anti-inflammatory treatments. However  future research with more nuanced measures is necessary to parse out whether appetite increases or decreases drive this association. Further  longitudinal research is an important next step to test how these relationships manifest over time."

The complement pathway  associated with cell lysis and phagocytosis  is implicated in synaptic elimination. Aberrant adolescent synaptic pruning may underpin schizophrenia onset; thus  changes in cortical complement activity during human development are of major interest. Complement is genetically linked to schizophrenia via increased C4 copy number variants  but the developmental trajectory of complement expression in the human brain is undetermined. As complement increases during periods of active synaptic engulfment in rodents  we hypothesized that complement expression would increase during postnatal development in humans  particularly during adolescence. Using human postmortem prefrontal cortex  we observed that complement activator (C1QB and C3) transcripts peaked in early neurodevelopment  and were highest in toddlers  declining in teenagers (all ANCOVAs between FÂ =Â 2.41 -3.325  pÂ =Â .01-0.05). We found that C4 protein was higher at 1-5Â years (HÂ =Â 16.378  pÂ =Â .012)  whereas C3 protein levels were unchanged with age. The microglial complement receptor subunit CD11b increased in mRNA early in life and peaked in the toddler brain (ANCOVA: pH  FÂ =Â 4.186  pÂ =Â .003). Complement inhibitors (CD46 and CD55) increased at school age  but failed to decrease like complement activators (both ANCOVAs  FÂ >Â 4.4  pÂ <Â .01). These data suggest the activation of complement in the human prefrontal cortex occurs between 1 and 5Â years.

Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However  since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component  the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system  with a marked inflammatory response  but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors  may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic  to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Data from previous pandemics  and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic  allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic  on the gestational environment  with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand  on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. As in previous pandemics  the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy  might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore  in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus  the risk of psychiatric disorders  especially mood disorders  is probably increased. In this context  preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus  it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus  in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise  in pregnant women  screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders."

Declines in the neuromuscular function and altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting mechanisms. In the first experiment  we examined the effect of prior handgrip exercise on the behavioral  perceptual  and affective responses to a sustained  sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment  transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance performance. However  perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the second experiment  prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex  cognitive-emotional interactions  which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function. Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance."

In recent years  abnormal inflammatory processes have been identified as putative pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets in mood disorders  particularly among individuals with treatment-resistant conditions. In this selective review  we aimed to summarise recent advances in the field of immunopsychiatry  including emerging pathophysiological models and findings from treatment ttrials of immunomodulatory agents for both MDD and bipolar disorders. We performed a literature review by searching Medline for clinical trials of immunomodulating agents as monotherapy or adjunctive treatments in MDD and bipolar disorders. Included studies are randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  cluster RCTs or cross-over trials of immunomodulating agents that had an active comparator or a placebo-arm. Current evidence shows an association between inflammation and mood symptoms. However  there is conflicting evidence on whether this link is causal. Future studies should focus on identifying specific neurobiological underpinnings for the putative causal association between an activated inflammatory response and mood disorders. Results of these studies are needed before further treatment trials of immunomodulatory agents can be justified."

IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R  DASS-21 anxiety  depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (pÂ <Â 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health  anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (pÂ <Â 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change  poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R  DASS depression  anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (pÂ <Â 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service.

"53","32040421",2020,"Multiple Holdouts With Stability: Improving the Generalizability of Machine Learning Analyses of Brain-Behavior Relationships.","In 2009  the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Domain Criteria  an attempt to move beyond diagnostic categories and ground psychiatry within neurobiological constructs that combine different levels of measures (e.g.  brain imaging and behavior). Statistical methods that can integrate such multimodal data  however  are often vulnerable to overfitting  poor generalization  and difficulties in interpreting the results. We propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques  such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis  for identifying hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach  we investigated structural brain-behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter volumes  and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires and IQ and demographic measures. Both sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of brain-behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed  the identified brain-behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the literature concerning age  alcohol use  and depression-related changes in brain volume. Multivariate techniques (such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis) embedded in our novel framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or symptoms to neurobiology and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition of psychiatric disorders."

We used univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the immunophenotypes associated with depression and depression severity. Depression cases  compared with controls  had significantly increased immune cell counts  especially neutrophils  CD4 +  T cells  and monocytes  and increased inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6).

The odds of moderate/severe depression were also increased for the persistently high CRP group  but this was not statistically significant; OR=2.54 (95% CI  0.90-7.16). Repeat CRP measures were available for a subset  who may not be representative of all cohort participants.

Core depressive symptoms (low mood  anhedonia) were measured by the Short Form Survey (SF-36) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)  and participants were stratified into high (Nâ=â1921) versus low-depressive strata based on baseline ratings. Placebo-controlled change from baseline after 4-16 weeks of treatment was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) over all trials and for each subgroup of trials targeting one of 7 mechanisms (IL-6  TNF-Î±  IL-12/23  CD20  COX2  BLÎ³S  p38/MAPK14). Patients in the highÂ depressive stratum showed modest but significant effects on core depressive symptoms (SMDâ=â0.29  95% CI [0.12-0.45]) and related SF-36 measures of mental health and vitality.

Adjustments for physical health outcome marginally attenuated the average treatment effect on depressive symptoms (SMDâ=â0.20  95% CI: 0.06-0.35)  but more strongly attenuated effects on mental health and vitality. Effects of anti-IL-12/23 remained significant and anti-IL-6 antibodies became a trend after controlling for physical response to treatment.

We searched the PubMed database from its inception to July 2018  and selected studies that assessed depression using a validated tool/scale  and allowed the calculation of the proportion of patients with low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) or elevated CRP (>1 mg/L). After quality assessment  37 studies comprising 13 541 depressed patients and 155 728 controls were included. Based on the meta-analysis of 30 studies  the prevalence of low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) in depression was 27% (95% CI 21-34%); this prevalence was not associated with sample source (inpatient  outpatient or population-based)  antidepressant treatment  participant age  BMI or ethnicity. Based on the meta-analysis of 17 studies of depression and matched healthy controls  the odds ratio for low-grade inflammation in depression was 1.46 (95% CI 1.22-1.75). The prevalence of elevated CRP (>1 mg/L) in depression was 58% (95% CI 47-69%)  and the meta-analytic odds ratio for elevated CRP in depression compared with controls was 1.47 (95% CI 1.18-1.82). About a quarter of patients with depression show evidence of low-grade inflammation  and over half of patients show mildly elevated CRP levels. There are significant differences in the prevalence of low-grade inflammation between patients and matched healthy controls.

Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI scans  we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical white matter. In this healthy population  the expression of common developmental traits  namely compulsivity and impulsivity  is tied to a reduced growth of these MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain development."

However  it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with  or can be distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6 previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al.  2004). This confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead  subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1  2  9  10  11  15). The second sleep disorder factor (items 4  5  6) replicated previous findings in 'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and function (items 7  12  13  14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in idiopathic depression studies)  grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3  8  and 17) were excluded from analysis due to very low variance. At transition  interferon-alpha induced major depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized therapies."

We used morphometric similarity analysis of MRI data as a marker of interareal cortical connectivity in three prior case-control studies of psychosis: in total   n  = 185 cases and  n  = 227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced morphometric similarity in all three studies. There was also a replicable pattern of case-control differences in regional morphometric similarity  which was significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas but increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data  we found that the cortical map of case-control differences in morphometric similarity was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms and pathways. In addition  genes that were normally overexpressed in cortical areas with reduced morphometric similarity were significantly up-regulated in three prior post mortem studies of schizophrenia. We propose that this combined analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides insight into how previously implicated genes and proteins as well as a number of unreported genes in their topological vicinity on the protein interaction network may drive structural brain network changes mediating the genetic risk of schizophrenia."

This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or comorbidities  but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to psychotherapy  the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography  we then identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by direct stimulation of that network. These alterations were associated with individual differences in functional fMRI connectivity within the VAN. Our findings define specific neurobiological mechanisms in a subgroup of patients with PTSD that could contribute to the poor response to psychotherapy."

There is an increasing interest in using concise computational tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations  and especially to track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However  the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain  a problem compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements. We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of Pavlovian influences and other 'psychomarkers' guiding decision-making would behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task  we expected this influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally  we hypothesized it would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian effects had weak temporal stability  while model-fit was more stable. In terms of external validity  Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience within the task  in line with normative expectations. However  Pavlovian effects were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus  although this computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development  it does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived Pavlovian measures for future studies."

Bottlenecks and future perspectives for this expanding and promising field are also discussed. Pre-clinical studies have indicated that neurotransmitter systems  especially serotoninergic  noradrenergic and glutamatergic  as well as non-neurotransmitter pathways such as inflammation and oxidative processes might play a role in LTG's antidepressant effects. The mechanisms underlying LTG's anti-manic properties remain to be fully explored  but the available pre-clinical evidence points out to the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission  possibly through AMPA-receptors. Expert opinion: A major limitation of current pre-clinical investigations is that there are no experimental models that recapitulate the complexity of bipolar disorder. Significant methodological differences concerning time and dose of LTG treatment  administration route  animal strains  and behavioral paradigms also hamper the reproducibility of the findings  leading to contradictory conclusions. Moreover  the role of other mechanisms (e.g. inositol phosphate and GSK3Î² pathways) implicated in the mode of action of different mood-stabilizers must also be consolidated with LTG."

In the ALSPAC birth cohort  serum IL-6 and CRP levels were assessed at age 9â¯years and 19 depressive symptoms were assessed at age 18â¯years. We used modified Poisson generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each depressive symptom. In addition  we used confirmatory factor analysis to create two continuous latent variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension scores. Structural equation modelling was used to test the associations between IL-6 and these dimension scores.

Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally  volumes increased before puberty  peaked  and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions  comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact."

Androgens may play a role in this male-bias by sex-differentially impacting early prenatal brain development  particularly neural circuits that later develop specialized roles in social cognition. Here  we find that increasing prenatal testosterone in humans is associated with later reduction of functional connectivity between social brain default mode (DMN) subsystems in adolescent males  but has no effect in females. Since testosterone can work directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen receptor through aromatase conversion to estradiol  we further examined how a potent non-aromatizable androgen  dihydrotestosterone (DHT)  acts via theÂ AR to influence gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC)-particularly for genes of high-relevance for DMN circuitry. DHT dysregulates a number of genes enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and for genes that in later development are expressed in anatomical patterns that highly correspond to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. DMN-related and DHT-affected genes (e.g.  MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes  many of which impact excitation-inhibition balance. Androgens have male-specific prenatal influence over social brain circuitry in humans and may be relevant towards explaining some component of male-bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions."

When looking at the total population  there was a significant correlation between TNF-Î± and both the HADS depressive symptoms and the SCL-90-R cluster somatisation. Also  there was a significant association between IL-10 and the SCL-90-R cluster somatisation when analyzing the cohort (patients and controls together). These findings indicate that immune activity in CFS/ME patients deviates from that of healthy controls  which implies potential pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches to CFS/ME. More comprehensive studies should be carried out on defined CFS/ME subgroups."

Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as liraglutide are widely used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. There are considerable amounts of preclinical studies showing the effects of liraglutide on promotion of neurogenesis  while preventing apoptosis and oxidation. Preliminary clinical evidence has suggested that liraglutide could decrease weight gain  improve cognition and prevent cognitive decline.

Eotaxin-1/CCL11 is also involved with a skewed immune response toward a type-2 (Th2) profile. In addition to its role in immune response  recent studies have shown that eotaxin-1/CCL11 is associated with aging  neurogenesis and neurodegeneration  being able to influence neural progenitor cells  and microglia. Increased circulating levels of eotaxin-1/CCL11 have been described in major psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  major depression)  sometimes correlating with the severity of psychopathological and cognitive parameters. As similar findings have been reported in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease  it has been hypothesized that mechanisms involving eotaxin-1/CCL11 signaling may underlie the ""accelerated aging"" profile commonly linked to psychiatric disorders. Future studies must determine whether eotaxin-1/CCL11 can be regarded as a prognostic biomarker and/or as therapeutic target for resistant/progressive cases."

High-sensitivity CRP in peripheral venous blood  body mass index (BMI) and questionnaire assessments of depression  anxiety and childhood trauma were measured. Group differences in CRP were estimated  and partial least squares (PLS) analysis explored the relationships between CRP and specific clinical phenotypes. Compared with healthy volunteers  BMI-corrected CRP was significantly elevated in the treatment-resistant group (P = 0.007; Cohen's d = 0.47); but not significantly so in the treatment-responsive (d = 0.29) and untreated (d = 0.18) groups. PLS yielded an optimal two-factor solution that accounted for 34.7% of variation in clinical measures and for 36.0% of variation in CRP. Clinical phenotypes most strongly associated with CRP and heavily weighted on the first PLS component were vegetative depressive symptoms  BMI  state anxiety and feeling unloved as a child or wishing for a different childhood.

A systematic search of the literature using the electronic databases MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted through September 2017. Search terms included: ""hypoglycemia"" "" insulin""  ""cytokines""  and ""inflammation"". We included original studies assessing peripheral inflammatory markers during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans. Two hundred twenty-two citations were initially retrieved. Eleven studies were included in our systematic review. Acute hypoglycemia increases total leukocyte number and several pro-inflammatory markers. Elevation in pro-inflammatory markers in response to insulin-induced acute hypoglycemia appears to be of similar magnitude in non-diabetic subjects and in type-1 diabetic patients with intact awareness of hypoglycemia. Adrenaline rises in response to acute hypoglycemia correlates with the increase of pro-inflammatory markers. Acute hypoglycemia induces a pro-inflammatory state in both type-1 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with no apparent significant difference between these two populations. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is a likely mediator of these effects."

We examined associations between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation  IQ  and subsequent schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (ONAP) to elucidate the role of neurodevelopment and inflammation in the pathogenesis of psychosis. Population-based data on ESR and IQ from 638 213 Swedish men assessed during military conscription between 1969 and 1983 were linked to National Hospital Discharge Register for hospitalisation with schizophrenia and ONAP. The associations of ESR with IQ (cross-sectional) and psychoses (longitudinal) were investigated using linear and Cox-regression. The co-relative analysis was used to examine effects of shared familial confounding. We examined mediation and moderation of effect between ESR and IQ on psychosis risk. Baseline IQ was associated with subsequent risk of schizophrenia (adjusted HR per 1-point increase in IQ = 0.961; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960-0.963) and ONAP (adjusted HR = 0.973; 95% CI 0.971-0.975). Higher ESR was associated with lower IQ in a dose-response fashion. High ESR was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia (adjusted HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28) and decreased risk for ONAP (adjusted HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.96)  although these effects were specific to one ESR band (7-10 mm/hr). Familial confounding explained ESR-IQ but not ESR-psychoses associations. IQ partly mediated the ESR-psychosis relationships. Lower IQ is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and with an increased risk of schizophrenia and ONAP in adulthood. Low-grade inflammation may influence schizophrenia risk by affecting neurodevelopment. Future studies should explore the differential effects of inflammation on different types of psychosis."

A high prevalence (25-40%) of SSD has been found in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)  which is known for T-cell deficits due to thymus hypoplasia. This study is the first to explore the association between the T-cell subsets and psychotic symptoms in adults with 22q11.2DS. 34 individuals (aged 19-38â¯yrs.) with 22q11.2DS and 34 healthy age- and gender matched control individuals were included. FACS analysis of the blood samples was performed to define T-cell subsets. Ultra-high risk for psychosis or diagnosis of SSD was determined based on CAARMS interviews and DSM-5 criteria for SSD. Positive psychotic symptom severity was measured based on the PANSS positive symptoms subscale. A partial T-cell immune deficiency in 22q11.2DS patients was confirmed by significantly reduced percentages of circulating T and T-helper cells. Significantly higher percentages of inflammatory Th1  Th17  and memory T-helper cells were found in adults with 22q11.2DS. Most importantly an increased Th17 percentage was found in adults with psychotic symptoms as compared to non-psychotic adults with 22q11.2DS  and Th17 percentage were related to the presence of positive psychotic symptoms. Given the literature on the role of T cells and in particular of Th17 cells and IL-17 in hippocampus development  cognition and behavior  these results support the hypothesis for a role of Th17 cells in the development and/or regulation of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS.

This study describes the actions of 2 monoaminergic antidepressants (escitalopram  nortriptyline) and 3 anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin  prednisolone  and anti-TNFÎ± antibody) on the response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from 6 individuals to LPS or IFN-Î±. Expression profiling revealed robust changes in the MDM transcriptome (3294 genes at PÂ <Â 0.001) following LPS challenge  whereas a more limited subset of genes (499) responded to IFNÎ±. Contrary to published reports  administered at nontoxic doses  neither monoaminergic antidepressant significantly modulated the transcriptional response to either inflammatory challenge. Each anti-inflammatory drug had a distinct impact on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and on the profile of inducible gene expression-notably on the regulation of enzymes involved in metabolism of tryptophan. Inter alia  the effect of anti-TNFÎ± antibody confirmed a predicted autocrine stimulatory loop in human macrophages. The transcriptional changes were predictive of tryptophan availability and kynurenine synthesis  as analyzed by targeted metabolomic studies on cellular supernatants. We suggest that inflammatory processes in the brain or periphery could impact on depression by altering the availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis and/or by increasing production of neurotoxic kynurenine."

LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used  with some limitations  in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO  Nâ¯=â¯204 (Nâ¯=â¯32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention.

"94","29277403",2017,"Probabilistic thresholding of functional connectomes: Application to schizophrenia.","Functional connectomes are commonly analysed as sparse graphs  constructed by thresholding cross-correlations between regional neurophysiological signals. Thresholding generally retains the strongest edges (correlations)  either by retaining edges surpassing a given absolute weight  or by constraining the edge density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods  which enable construction of probabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type I error  to a dataset of resting-state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value  we found that functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more dysconnected than those of healthy controls  exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher number of (dis)connected components. Furthermore  many participants' connectomes could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the literature (â¼5-30%)  while controlling for type I error. Additionally  we showed that the topological randomisation previously reported in the schizophrenia literature is likely attributable to ""non-significant"" edges added when thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation. Finally  by explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value and decreasing correlation  we showed that probabilistically thresholded connectomes show decreased randomness and increased consistency across participants. Our results have implications for future analysis of functional connectivity using graph theory  especially within datasets exhibiting heterogenous distributions of edge weights (correlations)  between groups or across participants."

In three cohorts (two human  one macaque)  we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions  and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally  variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for aboutÂ 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric similarity mapping provides a novel  robust  and biologically plausible approach to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in psychological functions."

Here  we first constructed a structural covariance network from MRI measures of cortical thickness on 296 healthy volunteers  aged 14-24 years. Next  we designed a new algorithm for matching sample locations from the Allen Brain Atlas to the nodes of the SCN. Subsequently we used this to define  transcriptomic brain networks by estimating gene co-expression between pairs of cortical regions. Finally  we explored the hypothesis that transcriptional networks and structural MRI connectomes are coupled. A transcriptional brain network (TBN) and a structural covariance network (SCN) were correlated across connection weights and showed qualitatively similar complex topological properties: assortativity  small-worldness  modularity  and a rich-club. In both networks  the weight of an edge was inversely related to the anatomical (Euclidean) distance between regions. There were differences between networks in degree and distance distributions: the transcriptional network had a less fat-tailed degree distribution and a less positively skewed distance distribution than the SCN. However  cortical areas connected to each other within modules of the SCN had significantly higher levels of whole genome co-expression than expected by chance. Nodes connected in the SCN had especially high levels of expression and co-expression of a human supragranular enriched (HSE) gene set that has been specifically located to supragranular layers of human cerebral cortex and is known to be important for large-scale  long-distance cortico-cortical connectivity.

A common  functional variant in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala; rs2228145 Aâ¯>â¯C) is known to dampen down inflammation by impairing IL6R signaling. We have examined the association of Asp358Ala with diagnosis of depression and psychosis  serum IL-6  CRP levels  and a number of risk factors commonly linked with inflammation  depression or psychosis. We predicted that if IL-6 were related to depression/psychosis risk causally  rather than due to confounding  Asp358Ala would be associated with risk of these disorders  serum IL-6  CRP levels  but not with any of the confounders. We used data from the population-based ALSPAC birth cohort. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were measured at age 9â¯years. Psychotic disorder  ICD-10 diagnosis of severe depressive episode  and total depression score were assessed at age 18â¯years. IL6R Asp358Ala was genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform. Risk factors assessed include sex  body mass index  social class  ethnicity  maternal education  birth weight  gestational age  maternal post-natal depression  childhood psychological and behavioral problems  and total IQ score. Asp358Ala was associated with decreased risk of severe depression and/or psychosis; adjusted odds ratio for those with CC  compared with AA  genotype was 0.38 (95% CI  0.15-0.94). The variant was associated with increased serum IL-6 levels (Pâ¯=â¯5.5â¯Ãâ¯10 -22 ) but decreased serum CRP levels (Pâ¯=â¯3.5â¯Ãâ¯10 -5 )  consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect downstream of IL-6. Asp358Ala was not associated with total depression score. Asp358Ala was not associated with any of the other risk factors commonly linked with inflammation  depression or psychosis (all Pâ¯>â¯0.20). The findings provide further evidence that the IL-6/IL6R pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and psychosis  and may be novel therapeutic targets.

Depressive symptoms were measured six times between 10 and 19 years using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ)  which were coded as binary variable and then used in latent class analysis to identify developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms. Longitudinal SMFQ data from 9156 participants yielded three distinct population sub-groups of depressive symptoms: no symptoms (81.2%); adolescent-onset symptoms (13.2%); persistent symptoms (5.6%). Lower IQ and higher IL-6 levels in childhood were independently associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms in a linear  dose-response fashion  but not with adolescent-onset symptoms. Compared with the group with no symptoms the adjusted odds ratio for persistent depressive symptoms per s.d. increase in IQ was 0.80 (95% CI  0.68-0.95); that for IL-6 was 1.20 (95% CI  1.03-1.39). Evidence for an association with IL-6 remained after controlling for initial severity of depressive symptoms at 10 years.

Following peripheral administration in rodents  interferon-Î± induces signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) within the hippocampus and disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis. We used the human hippocampal progenitor cell line HPC0A07/03C to evaluate the effects of 2 concentrations of interferon-Î±  similar to those observed in human serum during its therapeutic use (500 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL)  on neurogenesis and apoptosis. Both concentrations of interferon-Î± decreased hippocampal neurogenesis  with the high concentration also increasing apoptosis. Moreover  interferon-Î± increased the expression of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)  ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18)  and interleukin-6 (IL-6) via activation of STAT1. Like interferon-Î±  co-treatment with a combination of ISG15  USP18  and IL-6 was able to reduce neurogenesis and enhance apoptosis via further downstream activation of STAT1. Further experiments showed that ISG15 and USP18 mediated the interferon-Î±-induced reduction in neurogenesis (potentially through upregulation of the ISGylation-related proteins UBA7  UBE2L6  and HERC5)  while IL-6 mediated the interferon-Î±-induced increase in apoptosis (potentially through downregulation of aquaporin 4). Using transcriptomic analyses  we showed that interferon-Î± regulated pathways involved in oxidative stress and immune response (e.g.  Nuclear Factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 [Nrf2] and interferon regulatory factor [IRF] signaling pathway)  neuronal formation (e.g.  CAMP response element-binding protein [CREB] signaling)  and cell death regulation (e.g.  tumor protein(p)53 signaling). We identify novel molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of interferon-Î± on the human hippocampus potentially involved in inflammation-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms."

We examined whether being inflamed on multiple occasions increases risk of new depressive symptoms using prospective data from a population-based sample of adults aged 50 years or older (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). Participants with less than four of eight depressive symptoms in 2004/05 and 2008/09 based on the Eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale were analysed. The number of occasions with C-reactive protein â©¾3âmgâl -1  over the same initial assessments (1 vs 0 occasion  and 2 vs 0 occasions) was examined in relation to change in depressive symptoms between 2008/09 and 2012/13 and odds of developing depressive symptomology (having more than or equal to four of eight symptoms) in 2012/13. In multivariable-adjusted regression models (n=2068)  participants who were inflamed on 1 vs 0 occasion showed no increase in depressive symptoms nor raised odds of developing depressive symptomology; those inflamed on 2 vs 0 occasions showed a 0.10 (95% confidence intervals (CIs)=-0.07  0.28) symptom increase and 1.60 (95% CI=1.00  2.55) times higher odds. In further analyses  2 vs 0 occasions of inflammation were associated with increased odds of developing depressive symptoms among women (odds ratio (OR)=2.75  95% CI=1.53  4.95)  but not among men (OR=0.70  95% CI=0.29  1.68); P-for-sex interaction=0.035.

In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults ( N = 785; n = 566 across two waves  mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14-25 years)  we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains  fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory  investment theory  and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model  which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development  provides the best account of developmental changes.

We used microarray data on whole blood from two independent case-control studies of MDD: the GlaxoSmithKline-High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program [GSK-HiTDiP] study (113 patients and 57 healthy control subjects) and the Janssen-Brain Resource Company study (94 patients and 100 control subjects). Genome-wide differential gene expression analysis (18 863 probes) resulted in a p value for each gene in each study. A Bayesian method identified the largest p-value threshold (qÂ =Â .025) associated with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance. A total of 165 genes were differentially expressed in both studies with concordant direction of fold change. The 90 genes overexpressed (or UP genes) in MDD were significantly enriched for immune response to infection  were concentrated in a module of the gene coexpression network associated with innate immunity  and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in monocytes  monocyte-derived dendritic cells  and neutrophils. In contrast  the 75 genes underexpressed (or DOWN genes) in MDD were associated with the adaptive immune response and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in T cells  natural killer cells  and erythroblasts. Consistently  the MDD patients with overexpression of UP genes also had underexpression of DOWN genes (correlation > .70 in both studies). MDD was replicably associated with proinflammatory activation of the peripheral innate immune system  coupled with relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system  indicating the potential of transcriptional biomarkers for immunological stratification of patients with depression."

Regardless  most studies have focused on only one condition  with considerable heterogeneity in their results. Taking a dual-condition approach might help elucidate shared and distinct neural characteristics. Graph theory was used to analyse topological properties of structural covariance networks across both conditions and relative to a neurotypical (NT; n = 87) group using data from the ABIDE (autism; n = 62) and ADHD-200 datasets (ADHD; n = 69). Regional cortical thickness was used to construct the structural covariance networks. This was analysed in a theoretical framework examining potential differences in long and short-range connectivity  with a specific focus on relation between central graph measures and cortical thickness. We found convergence between autism and ADHD  where both conditions show an overall decrease in CT covariance with increased Euclidean distance between centroids compared with a NT population. The 2 conditions also show divergence. Namely  there is less modular overlap between the 2 conditions than there is between each condition and the NT group. The ADHD group also showed reduced cortical thickness and lower degree in hub regions than the autism group. Lastly  the ADHD group also showed reduced wiring costs compared with the autism groups. Our results indicate a need for taking an integrated approach when considering highly comorbid conditions such as autism and ADHD. Furthermore  autism and ADHD both showed alterations in the relation between inter-regional covariance and centroid distance  where both groups show a steeper decline in covariance as a function of distance. The 2 groups also diverge on modular organization  cortical thickness of hub regions and wiring cost of the covariance network. Thus  on some network features the groups are distinct  yet on others there is convergence."

In this review  we consider how these techniques  when grounded in the theory and methods of network science  can contribute to a biological understanding of mental illness. We focus in particular on attempts to accurately map brain network disturbances in clinical populations and to model the mechanistic causes of these changes. This work suggests that pathology within highly connected hub regions is a consistent finding across a broad array of phenotypically diverse disorders  and that disparate changes in brain network organization can sometimes be explained by a surprisingly small and simple set of mechanisms."

We have mapped the putative monoamine connections  as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections  in C. elegans based on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide networks exhibit distinct topological properties  with the monoamine network displaying a highly disassortative star-like structure with a rich-club of interconnected broadcasting hubs  and the neuropeptide network showing a more recurrent  highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between the extrasynaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes  we find highly significant multilink motifs of interaction  pinpointing locations in the network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity. Thus  the C. elegans connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with synaptic  gap junction  and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or junctional circuits and extrasynaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small number of modulatory neurons."

Here  we review briefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and generation of small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key developments in the field in the past decade and we consider in some detail the implications of recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to map the anatomical networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so  we draw attention to the important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or unweighted graphs  which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain network analysis in the past  and the topology of weighted graphs  which retain more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies.

Large studies  comprising hundreds of experiments  have become feasible by automated methods. However  this comes at the cost of positive-mean noise making it difficult to detect weak connections  which are of particular interest as recent high resolution tract-tracing studies of the macaque have identified many more weak connections  adding up to greater connection density of cortical networks  than previously recognized. We propose a statistical framework that estimates connectivity weights and credibility intervals from multiple tract-tracing experiments. We model the observed signal as a log-normal distribution generated by a combination of tracer fluorescence and positive-mean noise  also accounting for injections into multiple regions. Using anterograde viral tract-tracing data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences  we estimate the connection density of the mouse intra-hemispheric cortical network to be 73% (95% credibility interval (CI): 71%  75%); higher than previous estimates (40%). Inter-hemispheric density was estimated to be 59% (95% CI: 54%  62%). The weakest estimable connections (about 6 orders of magnitude weaker than the strongest connections) are likely to represent only one or a few axons. These extremely weak connections are topologically more random and longer distance than the strongest connections  which are topologically more clustered and shorter distance (spatially clustered). Weak links do not substantially contribute to the global topology of a weighted brain graph  but incrementally increased topological integration of a binary graph. The topology of weak anatomical connections in the mouse brain  rigorously estimable down to the biological limit of a single axon between cortical areas in these data  suggests that they might confer functional advantages for integrative information processing and/or they might represent a stochastic factor in the development of the mouse connectome."

Here  we estimated intra-modular degree  inter-modular degree and connection distance for each of 285 cortical nodes in multi-echo fMRI data from 38 healthy adults. We used the multivariate technique of partial least squares (PLS) to reduce the dimensionality of the relationships between these three nodal network parameters and prior microarray data on regional expression of 20 737 genes. The first PLS component defined a transcriptional profile associated with high intra-modular degree and short connection distance  whereas the second PLS component was associated with high inter-modular degree and long connection distance. Nodes in superior and lateral cortex with high inter-modular degree and long connection distance had local transcriptional profiles enriched for oxidative metabolism and mitochondria  and for genes specific to supragranular layers of human cortex. In contrast  primary and secondary sensory cortical nodes in posterior cortex with high intra-modular degree and short connection distance had transcriptional profiles enriched for RNA translation and nuclear components. We conclude that  as predicted  topologically integrative hubs  mediating long-distance connections between modules  are more costly in terms of mitochondrial glucose metabolism.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interpreting BOLD: a dialogue between cognitive and cellular neuroscience'."

It is therefore important to determine the degree to which computational models reproduce the topological features of empirical functional brain networks. We used empirical connectivity data derived from diffusion spectrum and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy individuals. Empirical and simulated functional networks  constrained by structural connectivity  were defined based on 66 brain anatomical regions (nodes). Simulated functional data were generated using the Kuramoto model in which each anatomical region acts as a phase oscillator. Network topology was studied using graph theory in the empirical and simulated data. The difference (relative error) between graph theory measures derived from empirical and simulated data was then estimated. We found that simulated data can be used with confidence to model graph measures of global network organization at different dynamic states and highlight the sensitive dependence of the solutions obtained in simulated data on the specified connection densities. This study provides a method for the quantitative evaluation and external validation of graph theory metrics derived from simulated data that can be used to inform future study designs."

We found and replicated that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 y. However  association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Age-related increases in cortical myelination were maximized approximately at the internal layer of projection neurons. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic  oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. We conclude that normative human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence."

This theory predicts that any feature of autism in males should 1) be present in autistic females  2) differentiate between the sexes in the typical population  and 3) correlate with autistic traits. We tested these three predictions for default mode network (DMN) hypoconnectivity during the resting state  one of the most robustly found neurobiological differences in autism. We analyzed a primary dataset of adolescents ( N  = 121  12-18 years of age) containing a relatively large number of females and a replication multisite dataset including children  adolescents  and adults ( N  = 980  6-58 years of age).

We found significant differences in DMN intraconnectivity between female controls and females with autism ( p =  .001 in the primary dataset;  p =  .009 in the replication dataset)  and between female controls and male controls ( p =  .036 in the primary dataset;  p =  .002 in the replication dataset). We also found a significant correlation between DMN intraconnectivity and performance on a mentalizing task ( p =  .001) in the primary dataset. Collectively  these findings provide the first evidence for DMN hypoconnectivity as a behaviorally relevant neuroimaging phenotype of the sex-related spectrum of autistic traits  of which autism represents the extreme case."

We then used linear discriminant analysis to calculate mRNA values cutoffs that best discriminated between responders and nonresponders after 12 weeks of antidepressants. As Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor and interleukin-1Î² might be involved in different pathways  we constructed a protein-protein interaction network by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. We identified cutoff values for the absolute mRNA measures that accurately predicted response probability on an individual basis  with positive predictive values and specificity for nonresponders of 100% in both samples (negative predictive value=82% to 85%  sensitivity=52% to 61%). Using network analysis  we identified different clusters of targets for these 2 cytokines  with Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor interacting predominantly with pathways involved in neurogenesis  neuroplasticity  and cell proliferation  and interleukin-1Î² interacting predominantly with pathways involved in the inflammasome complex  oxidative stress  and neurodegeneration.

Strong environmental insults early in life  such as infections  acting on a background of genetic vulnerability  may induce potent and enduring inflammatory responses setting a state of liability to second-hit environmental encounters  namely childhood trauma  drug abuse or additional infectious exposures. The immunogenetic background of susceptibility  suggested to be not only lying within the HLA locus but also implicating inherited deficits of the innate immune system  may amplify the harmful biological effects of infections/psychosocial stress leading to the manifestation of a broad range of psychiatric symptoms.

In an effort to interpret these findings from a network perspective  we carried out a meta-analysis of this literature  mapping anatomical locations of under- and over-activation to the topology of a normative human functional connectome. We included 314 task-based functional neuroimaging studies including more than 5000 patients with schizophrenia and over 5000 controls. Coordinates of significant under- or over-activations in patients relative to controls were mapped to nodes of a normative connectome defined by a prior meta-analysis of 1641 functional neuroimaging studies of task-related activation in healthy volunteers. Under-activations and over-activations were reported in a wide diversity of brain regions. Both under- and over-activations were significantly more likely to be located in hub nodes that constitute the ""rich club"" or core of the normative connectome. In a subset of 121 studies that reported both under- and over-activations in the same patients  we found that  in network terms  these abnormalities were located in close topological proximity to each other. Under-activation in a peripheral node was more frequently associated specifically with over-activation of core nodes than with over-activation of another peripheral node. Although schizophrenia is associated with altered brain functional activation in a wide variety of regions  abnormal responses are concentrated in hubs of the normative connectome. Task-specific under-activation in schizophrenia is accompanied by over-activation of topologically central  less functionally specialized network nodes  which may represent a compensatory response."

Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence  and may thus underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their relatives.

"131","26150519",2015,"Randomization and resilience of brain functional networks as systems-level endophenotypes of schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is increasingly conceived as a disorder of brain network organization or dysconnectivity syndrome. Functional MRI (fMRI) networks in schizophrenia have been characterized by abnormally random topology. We tested the hypothesis that network randomization is an endophenotype of schizophrenia and therefore evident also in nonpsychotic relatives of patients. Head movement-corrected  resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 25 patients with schizophrenia  25 first-degree relatives of patients  and 29 healthy volunteers. Graphs were used to model functional connectivity as a set of edges between regional nodes. We estimated the topological efficiency  clustering  degree distribution  resilience  and connection distance (in millimeters) of each functional network. The schizophrenic group demonstrated significant randomization of global network metrics (reduced clustering  greater efficiency)  a shift in the degree distribution to a more homogeneous form (fewer hubs)  a shift in the distance distribution (proportionally more long-distance edges)  and greater resilience to targeted attack on network hubs. The networks of the relatives also demonstrated abnormal randomization and resilience compared with healthy volunteers  but they were typically less topologically abnormal than the patients' networks and did not have abnormal connection distances. We conclude that schizophrenia is associated with replicable and convergent evidence for functional network randomization  and a similar topological profile was evident also in nonpsychotic relatives  suggesting that this is a systems-level endophenotype or marker of familial risk. We speculate that the greater resilience of brain networks may confer some fitness advantages on nonpsychotic relatives that could explain persistence of this endophenotype in the population. "
"132","25944610",2015,"A wavelet-based estimator of the degrees of freedom in denoised fMRI time series for probabilistic testing of functional connectivity and brain graphs.","Connectome mapping using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a focus of systems neuroscience. There remain many statistical challenges in analysis of functional connectivity and network architecture from BOLD fMRI multivariate time series. One key statistic for any time series is its (effective) degrees of freedom  df  which will generally be less than the number of time points (or nominal degrees of freedom  N). If we know the df  then probabilistic inference on other fMRI statistics  such as the correlation between two voxel or regional time series  is feasible. However  we currently lack good estimators of df in fMRI time series  especially after the degrees of freedom of the ""raw"" data have been modified substantially by denoising algorithms for head movement. Here  we used a wavelet-based method both to denoise fMRI data and to estimate the (effective) df of the denoised process. We show that seed voxel correlations corrected for locally variable df could be tested for false positive connectivity with better control over Type I error and greater specificity of anatomical mapping than probabilistic connectivity maps using the nominal degrees of freedom. We also show that wavelet despiked statistics can be used to estimate all pairwise correlations between a set of regional nodes  assign a P value to each edge  and then iteratively add edges to the graph in order of increasing P. These probabilistically thresholded graphs are likely more robust to regional variation in head movement effects than comparable graphs constructed by thresholding correlations. Finally  we show that time-windowed estimates of df can be used for probabilistic connectivity testing or dynamic network analysis so that apparent changes in the functional connectome are appropriately corrected for the effects of transient noise bursts. Wavelet despiking is both an algorithm for fMRI time series denoising and an estimator of the (effective) df of denoised fMRI time series. Accurate estimation of df offers many potential advantages for probabilistically thresholding functional connectivity and network statistics tested in the context of spatially variant and non-stationary noise.

"133","25855164",2015,"Emergence of rich-club topology and coordinated dynamics in development of hippocampal functional networks in vitro.","Recent studies demonstrated that the anatomical network of the human brain shows a ""rich-club"" organization. This complex topological feature implies that highly connected regions  hubs of the large-scale brain network  are more densely interconnected with each other than expected by chance. Rich-club nodes were traversed by a majority of short paths between peripheral regions  underlining their potential importance for efficient global exchange of information between functionally specialized areas of the brain. Network hubs have also been described at the microscale of brain connectivity (so-called ""hub neurons""). Their role in shaping synchronous dynamics and forming microcircuit wiring during development  however  is not yet fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role of hubs during network development  using multi-electrode arrays and functional connectivity analysis during spontaneous multi-unit activity (MUA) of dissociated primary mouse hippocampal neurons. Over the first 4 weeks in vitro  functional connectivity significantly increased in strength  density  and size  with mature networks demonstrating a robust modular and small-world topology. As expected by a ""rich-get-richer"" growth rule of network evolution  MUA graphs were found to form rich-clubs at an early stage in development (14 DIV). Later on  rich-club nodes were a consistent topological feature of MUA graphs  demonstrating high nodal strength  efficiency  and centrality. Rich-club nodes were also found to be crucial for MUA dynamics. They often served as broker of spontaneous activity flow  confirming that hub nodes and rich-clubs may play an important role in coordinating functional dynamics at the microcircuit level. "
"134","25800211",2015,"Dopamine and memory dedifferentiation in aging.","The dedifferentiation theory of aging proposes that a reduction in the specificity of neural representations causes declines in complex cognition as people get older  and may reflect a reduction in dopaminergic signaling. The present pharmacological fMRI study investigated episodic memory-related dedifferentiation in young and older adults  and its relation to dopaminergic function  using a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design with the agonist Bromocriptine (1.25mg) and the antagonist Sulpiride (400mg). We used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure memory specificity: the degree to which distributed patterns of activity distinguishing two different task contexts during an encoding phase are reinstated during memory retrieval. As predicted  memory specificity was reduced in older adults in prefrontal cortex and in hippocampus  consistent with an impact of neural dedifferentiation on episodic memory representations. There was also a linear age-dependent dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus reflecting a relative boost to memory specificity on Bromocriptine in older adults whose memory was poorer at baseline  and a relative boost on Sulpiride in older better performers  compared to the young. This differed from generalized effects of both agents on task specificity in the encoding phase. The results demonstrate a link between aging  dopaminergic function and dedifferentiation in the hippocampus."
"135","25180309",2014,"Generative models of rich clubs in Hebbian neuronal networks and large-scale human brain networks.","Rich clubs arise when nodes that are 'rich' in connections also form an elite  densely connected 'club'. In brain networks  rich clubs incur high physical connection costs but also appear to be especially valuable to brain function. However  little is known about the selection pressures that drive their formation. Here  we take two complementary approaches to this question: firstly we show  using generative modelling  that the emergence of rich clubs in large-scale human brain networks can be driven by an economic trade-off between connection costs and a second  competing topological term. Secondly we show  using simulated neural networks  that Hebbian learning rules also drive the emergence of rich clubs at the microscopic level  and that the prominence of these features increases with learning time. These results suggest that Hebbian learning may provide a neuronal mechanism for the selection of complex features such as rich clubs. The neural networks that we investigate are explicitly Hebbian  and we argue that the topological term in our model of large-scale brain connectivity may represent an analogous connection rule. This putative link between learning and rich clubs is also consistent with predictions that integrative aspects of brain network organization are especially important for adaptive behaviour. "
"136","25064668",2014,"Differentiating BOLD and non-BOLD signals in fMRI time series from anesthetized rats using multi-echo EPI at 11.7 T.","The study of spontaneous brain activity using fMRI is central to mapping brain networks. However  current fMRI methodology has limitations in the study of small animal brain organization using ultra-high field fMRI experiments  as imaging artifacts are difficult to control and the relationship between classical neuroanatomy and spontaneous functional BOLD activity is not fully established. Challenges are especially prevalent during the fMRI study of individual rodent brains  which could be instrumental to studies of disease progression and pharmacology. A recent advance in fMRI methodology enables unbiased  accurate  and comprehensive identification of functional BOLD signals by interfacing multi-echo (ME) fMRI acquisition  NMR signal decay analysis  and independent components analysis (ICA)  in a procedure called ME-ICA. Here we present a pilot study on the suitability of ME-ICA for ultra high field animal fMRI studies of spontaneous brain activity under anesthesia. ME-ICA applied to 11.7 T fMRI data of rats first showed robust performance in automatic high dimensionality estimation and ICA decomposition  similar to that previously reported for 3.0 T human data. ME sequence optimization for 11.7 T indicated that 3 echoes  0.5mm isotropic voxel size and TR=3s was adequate for sensitive and specific BOLD signal acquisition. Next  in seeking optimal inhaled isoflurane anesthesia dosage  we report that progressive increase in anesthesia goes with concomitant decrease in statistical complexity of ""global"" functional activity  as measured by the number of BOLD components  or degrees of freedom (DOF). Finally  BOLD functional connectivity maps for individual rodents at the component level show that spontaneous BOLD activity follows classical neuroanatomy  and seed-based analysis shows plausible cortical-cortical and cortical-subcortical functional interactions."
"137","25057133",2014,"The hubs of the human connectome are generally implicated in the anatomy of brain disorders.","Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly connected hub nodes that are functionally valuable  because their topological centrality supports integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other brain regions  and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological cost  we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub regions. To test this general hypothesis  we first identified the hubs of brain anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy volunteers (n = 56)  and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps  based on meta-analyses of published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal brain connectome (P < 10(-4)  permutation test). Specifically  nine brain disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs (P < 0.05  permutation test)  including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions  although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion probability in Alzheimer's disease  whereas in schizophrenia lesions were concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many (if not all) brain disorders. "

This shift has paralleled rapid advances in connectomics  a field concerned with comprehensively mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts  as it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper  we provide a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain disease  with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Specifically  we consider how research into circuit-level  connectome-wide and topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of disturbances in an interconnected complex system  rather than discrete pathology in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.

"140","24690112",2014,"Abnormal cortical growth in schizophrenia targets normative modules of synchronized development.","Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain connectivity and altered neurodevelopmental processes. Cross-sectional case-control studies in different age groups have suggested that deficits in cortical thickness in childhood-onset schizophrenia may normalize over time  suggesting a disorder-related difference in cortical growth trajectories. We acquired magnetic resonance imaging scans repeated over several years for each subject  in a sample of 106 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 102 age-matched healthy volunteers. Using semiparametric regression  we modeled the effect of schizophrenia on the growth curve of cortical thickness in ~80 000 locations across the cortex  in the age range 8 to 30 years. In addition  we derived normative developmental modules composed of cortical regions with similar maturational trajectories for cortical thickness in typical brain development. We found abnormal nonlinear growth processes in prefrontal and temporal areas that have previously been implicated in schizophrenia  distinguishing for the first time between cortical areas with age-constant deficits in cortical thickness and areas whose maturational trajectories are altered in schizophrenia. In addition  we showed that when the brain is divided into five normative developmental modules  the areas with abnormal cortical growth overlap significantly only with the cingulo-fronto-temporal module. These findings suggest that abnormal cortical development in schizophrenia may be modularized or constrained by the normal community structure of developmental modules of the human brain connectome."

Principally  antipsychotic medication  duration of illness  and current clinical state (acutely psychotic or remitted) may considerably alter immune response  as may other factors such as nutritional status  substance abuse  and concurrent medical illness. We review recent studies that employed current diagnostic criteria and modern immunologic techniques.

Immune abnormalities that have been replicated in studies of schizophrenic patients include increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies  decreased production of interleukin-2  and increased serum concentrations of interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6.

Decrease in IL-2 production  a finding frequently associated with many autoimmune diseases  was associated with an elevation in anti-hippocampal antibody optical density (AHA-OD) in schizophrenic patients. Although some control subjects had elevated antibody levels  this elevation was not associated with decreased IL-2 production. Low IL-2 production is well known to be a state marker associated with active autoimmune disease. We suggest that production of hippocampal antibody is a trait marker of vulnerability to autoimmune diseases. Thus  our finding of low IL-2 production in patients with high concentrations of hippocampal antibody is compatible with the possibility that such patients have an ongoing autoimmune process."
