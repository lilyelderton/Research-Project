Neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease are attracting more attention due to their broad spectrum and link to disease pathogenesis. Autoantibody-associated psychiatric disorders are of growing interest as the therapy is demanding and differs from standard psychopharmacological drug therapy. Psychiatric disorders associated with neural autoantibodies can be classified as autoimmune-mediated psychiatric disease when these neural autoantibodies occur in conjunction with specific clinical features, signs of central nervous system inflammation in neuroimaging, or in biomaterial probes such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (1–4)."

"2" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "A still enigmatic topic in autoantibody-related immunopsychiatry is whether psychopathology is influenced or even driven by the presence of autoantibodies. A recent study (5) showed that specific psychopathologic features are associated with specific autoantibodies, thus highlighting the relationship between a psychopathology’s pathogenesis and autoantibodies. A large sample of 461 psychotic patients was screened for autoantibodies in this study. Psychosis is a severe and debilitating disease condition characterized by psychopathology consisting of delusions, hallucinations or ego disturbances. They screened a subcohort of 24 patients for autoantibodies via protein arrays and detected six different autoantibodies associated with specific psychopathological features. Anti-adaptor-related protein complex 3, beta 2 subunit (AP3B2) antibodies were identified in conjunction with persecutory delusions, whereas anti-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) antibodies were more frequently co-detected with hallucinations in patients. Affective symptoms such as anhedonia and dysphoria were related to anti-recombinant WAS protein homologously associated with actin, Golgi membranes and microtubules pseudogene 3 (WHAMMP3) antibodies. Cognitive dysfunction was found to be mainly associated with anti-olfactomedin 1 (OLFM1) antibodies, and sleep dysfunction (insomnia) in patients was associated with anti-Gamma-crystallin N (CRYGN) antibodies. These examples in  Jernbom Falk´s study (2021) demonstrate that specific psychopathologic features might help deliver clues about which autoantibodies might be worth searching for. However, the likelihood of detecting autoantibodies is much higher if specific syndromes are present, ie, a psycho-organic syndrome accompanying cognitive dysfunction or paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome, as a recent cohort study showed that psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most relevant psychiatric conditions associated with autoantibodies (6). Although the occurrence of autoantibodies in first-episode psychosis is rare (7), neural autoantibodies are detected in first-episode psychosis, thus requiring a differential diagnosis including the search for autoantibodies. However, it is unclear which kind of first-episode psychotic patients warrant an autoantibody search. Unspecific indicators like autoimmune indicators are relevant, such as an actual or recent tumor diagnosis, movement disorder, altered consciousness, seizures, optic hallucinations, infectious prodrome with fever or aphasia, dysarthria and mutism (1, 3, 8). We do not yet know how these indicators are weighted specifically, apart from grouping them into minor and major indicators. According to our recent review (1), major indicators like seizures or a decreased level of consciousness and minor autoimmune indicators such as early resistance to therapy and fluctuating psychopathology can be distinguished. There would be major practical consequences if we knew which specific psychopathological parameters indicate a potential anti-neural autoantibody-mediated psychosis, for instance. In light of these reflections, Jernbom Falk´s study findings (2021) are very promising. We tested the psychopathological profiles of a cohort of psychiatric patients and found that psychiatric syndromes that are mainly psycho-organic and depressive reveal fewer affective symptoms in specific categories (like affective rigidity or rumination) than those patients without anti-neural autoantibodies (unpublished observations). These findings indicate that patients with a psycho-organic and depressive syndrome associated with neural-autoantibodies might have a psychopathology different from that in patients not presenting (anti-neural autoantibodies). This factor indicates the direction of potential psychopathological patterns associated with psychiatric disease in conjunction with autoantibodies. These studies illustrate the relevance of psychopathology for diagnostic purposes apart from grouping patients into diagnostic classification systems such as international classifications of diseases."

"3" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "The pathogenesis of neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is still not well understood, although there are pathophysiological models for several autoantibodies implying that autoantibodies per se might play a pathogenic role in the development of psychiatric symptoms and behavior. An animal model recently showed that a neuropsychiatric phenotype of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is modulated by NMDAR autoantibodies (9). NMDAR is a glutamatergic receptor responsible for excitatory neuronal plasticity in the brain on the one hand and may trigger excitotoxicity on the other hand in the brain. However, it is debatable whether these autoantibodies cause the encephalitis itself or only modify it, as depicted in a recent study (10). Other studies in mice have shown that it is not the brain’s acute exposure to NMDAR autoantibodies but rather their long-lasting presence that causes a behavioral phenotype entailing impaired cognitive function (11). NMDAR autoantibody-induced alterations in synaptic transmission are believed to be a key step in generating psychotic symptoms concurring with schizophrenia’s glutamatergic model (12). NMDAR autoantibodies lead to NMDAR internalization and removal from the cell surface linking them to an extrasynaptic compartment. The conditions necessary for normal synaptic transmission are thus disturbed. Dysfunctional synaptic transmission could lead to psychiatric problems like psychotic symptoms. NMDAR trafficking to extrasynaptic compartments has been observed in patients with psychotic disorders, but not in autistic patients or healthy controls, as Wollmuth et al. (13) described. Their finding makes it tempting to wonder if there might not be a variety of unknown molecular mechanisms associated with NMDAR antibodies among diverse psychiatric disorders. More research is needed to determine the molecular mechanism induced by autoantibody blockage of NMDAR. Generated monoclonal NMDAR antibodies recently applied to neuronal cultures revealed that these have an impact on disinhibitory signaling in cortical neuronal networks (14). Disturbed inhibitory cortical neurotransmission supposedly results in a hyperexcitable state that could enhance the induction and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, the autoantibody class seems to play a major role in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. As membrane-surface autoantibodies like NMDAR autoantibodies are probably pathogenic themselves (15), T-cell dependent proinflammatory states are probably irrelevant in relation to a membrane-surface autoantibody-associated neuropsychiatric disease such as NMDAR encephalitis (16), but T-cells are relevant immune cells involved in autoantibodies against intracellular targets associated with neuropsychiatric disease (17). Other novel autoantibodies have been identified playing a potential tole in specific psychiatric diseases, ie, anti-hypothalamus autoantibodies in anorexia nervosa (18). They suggest that these autoantibodies disturb the physiological processes by interacting with hypothalamic cells leading to augmented secretion of anorexigenic signaling (18). Another autoantibody category attracting considerable attention recently is anti-basal ganglia autoantibodies, believed to be pathogenically relevant for a subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder (2, 19). As the basal ganglia play a key role in movement execution, anti-basal ganglia antibodies could play a pathogenic role in interfering with movement causing the repetitive behaviors and actions associated with obsessive compulsive disorder. These examples show how more animal models are needed to investigate specific subclasses of neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease." "frontiers"
"4" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "Immune cells are potential biomarkers in patients with anti-neural autoantibody-related cognitive impairment and epilepsy, as recent investigations of ours showed (1, 20, 21). Recent evidence shows that cell flow cytometry is a promising method to evaluate immune cell subsets in psychotic disorders (22). CSF cell flowmetry is interesting as it helped detect a relative shift in immune cells from lymphocytes to monocytes in psychotic disorders, potentially indicating an altered adaptive immune system. Increased protein concentrations and blood-brain barrier disturbances have also been detected in these patients in line with those findings (22) indicating a leaky blood-brain barrier enabling immune-cell infiltration within the brain in patients suffering from psychotic disorders. These results show that flow cell cytometry is a potentially rewarding tool for clarifying questions related to cellular inflammation in patients with autoantibody-associated psychotic and neurocognitive syndromes. Flow cytometry should be applied with special focus on classic monocytes in psychosis (22) and CD4+ T-cells in verbal memory and executive functions should also be the spotlight of investigation (21). There is very recent and fascinating evidence of higher levels of CD3+CD4+CD25+Fox3 cells (also called regulatory T-cells) in the blood of patients with attention deficit hyperactive disorder compared to healthy controls (23). Elevated fractions of these regulatory T-cells thus seem to raise the risk of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (23). Another study by Gao et al. (24) addressed the usage of flow cell cytometry in monocytes and CD4+ T-cells in the blood of patients with bipolar disorder to measure lithium’s treatment efficacy. Indeed, a special flow- cytometric approach was employed to measure proteins and immune cells in this study. In this study we demonstrate that several proteins such as leptin, brain-derived growth factor, neurotrophin and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways are altered in patients responding to lithium, unlike in those who do not respond to it. Our preliminary findings reveal that flow cytometry in monocytes and CD4+ T-cells is a potentially useful technique when examining biomaterial samples to seek evidence in immunopsychiatry. To investigate a broader spectrum of proteins, other technologies like proteomics are preferable to flow cytometry for measuring proteins; they can supplement flow cytometry." "frontiers"
"5" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "Recent studies have described the potential of measuring neuroinflammation, ie, in schizophrenia (25) as a disease that severely affects cognition, emotions and daily life abilities or depression (26) accompanied by strong mood and psychomotor disturbances (by measuring the translocator protein 18kDa in activated microglia via PET imaging (TSPO). TSPO imaging has not yet been adopted in the clinical routine although the evidence regarding the detection of glial neuroinflammation in psychiatric disease has been promising. Further research should be extended to study the interaction between neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and acethylcholine and neuroinflammation via TSPO imaging in psychiatric and age-related, disease-associated anti-neural antibodies. TSPO imaging has proven useful in neuropsychiatric disease associated with autoantibodies such as lupus erythematosus, as (27) demonstrated in a recent study via the specific radioligand for TSPO named DPA (11C]DPA-713). Stronger DPA binding was shown in hippocampal and cerebellar regions in cognitively-impaired patients with neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus (27) indicating elevated glia cell activation in these regions. Glia cell activation underlie neuroinflammatory processes in lupus erythematosus patients, thereby yielding specific insights into the disease mechanisms of autoantibody-related psychiatric disease. TSPO imaging is known to facilitate the depiction of neuroinflammation in patients with major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (28), and dementia such as Alzheimer´s disease (29)." "frontiers"
"6" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "Further research should be done to discover promising regions to study psychopathologies and how they correlate with brain morphology. A recent study showed that a larger anterior insula volume is related to anxiety severity caused by inflammation (30). Another study (31) confirmed the link between inflammation by measuring cytokines and assessing brain morphology in psychiatric patients. Those authors (31) used blood cytokine markers from antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode psychotic patients, clustering these cytokines in inflammatory subtypes. Theoretical graph analyses were done to connect brain morphology and cytokine patterns classified as inflammatory subtypes in first-episode patients, which facilitated assessments of local and global network characteristics across inflammatory subtypes. Their study demonstrated enhanced regional volume of the right parahippocampal region, caudal anterior cingulate and bank superior sulcus in inflammation subtypes of schizophrenia. A similar link between neuroinflammation and brain volume was confirmed in another recent study with first-episode psychotic patients presenting a proinflammatory profile and elevated interferon gamma and interleukin 5, which were associated with lower total cortical volume (32). Lower cortical volumes might thus be associated with elevated cytokines indicating brain inflammation. Whether the brain inflammation is accompanied by a process involving a loss of brain volume, or the reduced brain volume itself triggers further inflammatory processes is unknown, and deserves further investigation. Another unexplored issue is where in the brain the inflammation in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease occurs. In a recent study of autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease, inflammatory processes were detected in motor structures like the basal ganglia, and in limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus region (33). However, the relationship between brain morphology and inflammation in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is sometimes hard to detect as the inflammation may only be mild and local and thus not visible on MRI or FDG PET neuroimaging exams or evident in CSF analysis. Zrzavy etal. (33) detected neuroinflammation in conjunction with inflammatory infiltration by parenchymal CD3/CD8+ T-cells and CD79a+ B-cells in parts of the basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus via postmortem immunopathological examinations. We therefore need innovative new methods to detect mild inflammation, as the current standard diagnostic procedures are inadequate. Peripheral inflammation might be informative as additional information for deciphering CNS inflammation, but often fail to correlate with CSF inflammation, as a recent study showed in patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (34). However, whether peripheral inflammation is useful is controversial, as another study showed upregulated complement mRNA expression in blood samples linked to cortical thinning in schizophrenia (35). More research is needed to clarify the role of peripheral inflammation in brain processes in anti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease and to take small changes in brain volume into account. Choroid plexus enlargement is another candidate for examination as altered brain structures may indicate an interrelationship between inflammation and brain morphology in term of substructures. A recent study reported an enlarged choroid plexus in patients with depression (36): the choroid-plexus volume correlated with binding in [11C]PK11195 PET/structural MRI imaging (36), confirming the link between neuroinflammation and choroid-plexus morphology. Assessing choroid-plexus morphology in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease might therefore be a future method to examine inflammation processes that are not yet clearly affecting white or gray matter morphology, but affect the choroid-plexus morphology early."

"7" "10.3389/fimmu.2022.867229" "Anti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is a novel field that presents several challenges, namely too little knowledge and too few studies investigating this disease, its underlying pathomechanisms are unknown, and treatment options are rare and have usually not been examined in large patient cohorts. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoantibodies often relies on animal models that preclude a direct transfer of evidence to humans. These aspects should be kept in mind when combining autoantibody analysis in novel diagnostic approaches with knowledge about autoantibodies’ pathophysiologic actions. However, only by addressing these questions while applying novel and highly sophisticated techniques can autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease and its many unknown facets be further explored. In addition, we need to study other patterns of brain damage or brain inflammation between psychiatric patients presenting autoantibodies in comparison to psychiatric patients presenting no autoantibodies (apart from specific neural autoantibodies) via blood proteomics to identify specific patterns by which to distinguish disease groups."

More effort should be invested to encourage attempts to apply these methods in order to understand the role of anti-neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease. Different classification criteria have been developed for subtypes of autoantibody-mediated psychiatric disease such as autoimmune psychosis (3), autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (2), and autoimmune dementia (37). More effort is needed to improve and test the diagnostic usefulness of several methods and evidence that have not yet been confirmed in large-scale studies. The methods described in this review also require substantial testing in large populations to prove their diagnostic validity in different psychiatric patient samples in a cross-sectional, but also longitudinal manner."

"15" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Despite increasing scientific knowledge and enormous efforts to classify psychiatric disorders, this field is currently limited by the absence of an articulated neurobiological substrate to delineate valid diagnostic entities, inhibiting the development of timely, explanatory, mechanism-based therapeutic strategies. Further, this constitutes a major driver for the failure to discover novel therapies for those with neuropsychiatric disorders [1]. Current diagnostic schemes for psychiatric disorders are based on descriptive nomenclature given the absence of clearly defined causal mechanisms. Such descriptive nomenclature does not easily include the multiple and successively occurring psychiatric and medical comorbidities, nor the considerable diagnostic instability demonstrated in longitudinal studies." "biomed_central"
"16" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Disturbances in the immuno-inflammatory system have been implicated in the aetiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology and comorbidity of several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major mood disorders, suicidal behaviour, post-traumatic disorder and autism [2, 3]. Inflammation and activated cell-mediated immune pathways have consistently been found in diverse patient cohorts indexed by an up-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [4, 5], triggered and sustained by environmental risk factors such as very early infections [6], severe childhood trauma [7] or lifelong psychosocial stressors [8]. It is noteworthy that inflammatory biomarkers overlap with risk pathways for medical disorders commonly comorbid with psychiatric disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis [9]. In this context, the emerging field of “immuno-psychiatry” has the potential to widen the exploration of a mechanism-based nosology, possibly leading to the discovery of more effective personalised treatment strategies. Herein, we provide the rationale for a research agenda to refine clinical practice, including the description of steps to define the basis of an immuno-psychiatry-based nosology, as well as pathways toward innovative treatment discovery. We describe putative research areas and delineate, for each of them, the current evidence, associated obstacles and research strategies to inform treatment decisions and to build an agenda for treatment discovery." "biomed_central"
"17" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Diagnosis in psychiatry is still restricted to symptoms and observable signs given the lack of valid biomarkers. Most biomarker candidates show insufficient sensitivity and specificity within disorders and overlap greatly between disorders [10]. Furthermore, diagnostic classification does not consider the medical and psychiatric comorbidities nor the lifetime staging processes [11]. Therefore, efforts to reformulate DSM-5 and ICD-11 nosology should be developed through careful exploration of possible mechanisms (e.g. dimensions, categories, environmental risk factors and/or biological markers) and should lead to, and ultimately be validated by, insightful and targeted therapeutic strategies. Along the same line, primary prevention strategies based on the identification of modifiable environmental risk factors associated with inflammation need to be conceptualised [2]. It is known that many of the known risk factors for disorders are indeed transduced via inflammatory and related pathways such as redox biology [2]. Indeed, we would argue for a common framework of conceptualised psychiatric disorders among the disproportionally comorbid non-communicable medical disorders because of shared antecedent risks and common biomarkers. This framework suggests and, as we will later illustrate, shows evidence for common treatment and preventive strategies. Linking cross-clinical dimensional symptomatology with epidemiological and biological observations may help refine meaningful new subgroups using environmental risk factors, such as infections or stress, to assess medical comorbid disorders and immune phenotypes to inform treatment." "biomed_central"
"18" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Autoimmune diseases and early infections are well-known to increase the risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, autism spectrum disorders or schizophrenia [3, 12, 13]. For instance, a history of hospitalisation for infection is known to increase the risk of later mood disorders by 45 %, while prior history of auto-immune disorders and infections interact in synergy to further raise the risk of subsequent mood disorders by more than 60 % [14]. Maternal history of auto-immune disorders is also associated with an increased risk of subsequent autism spectrum disorders in offspring of more than 40 % [15], whereas maternal infections requiring hospitalisation have been reported in autism spectrum disorders [16]. Auto-immunity in schizophrenia, affective psychosis and bipolar disorder has also been reported [17], thus clearly crossing classical diagnostic boundaries [6]. Cognitive decline and brain imaging abnormalities have also been associated with prenatal infections and/or elevated cytokine levels across disorders [18]." "biomed_central"
"19" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "How to translate these findings into an agenda? Not all subjects that experience early life infection develop psychiatric disorders. Environmental factors, such as early infection, could predispose to autoimmune disturbances in immunogenetically vulnerable individuals. A relevant validation strategy would thus be to search for associations between immunogenetic variants and life infection history. In animal models, for instance, transgenic mice displaying a genetic predisposition to autism exhibit enhanced responses to environmental challenges to maternal immune activation [19]. In humans, the major histocompatibility complex region that includes the human leukocyte (HLA) genes locus, which has a crucial role in initiating cellular and humoral immune responses as well as vulnerability to autoimmune disorders, appears as a major candidate to identify at-risk subjects. Several HLA genes and haplotypes are linked to autism [13], while HLA polymorphisms are amongst the most associated region in schizophrenia [20]. Furthermore, an association between bipolar patients with autoimmune comorbid disorders and genes encoding functional Toll Like Receptors (innate immunity) has been reported [21]. Strengthening the exploration of immunogenetic diversity in major psychiatric disorders, such as innate, adaptive immunity and inflammation pathways, is urgently needed as has been performed for cancer [22]. It is necessary to further test gene–gene interactions between risk pathways and the immune and synaptic pathways as demonstrated in autism [23] and schizophrenia [24]. This will permit identification of at-risk individuals and their follow-up along the developmental exposure to various infections and other environmental risk factors, additionally suggesting developmental pathways for novel therapeutic strategies." "biomed_central"
"20" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Besides the impact of early infections/autoimmune disorders in genetically sensitive subjects, a second “hit”, such as postnatal stress, also predisposes these individuals to physiological abnormalities mediated by prenatal immune activation. Indeed, early exposure to trauma in childhood can increase the subsequent risk of poor functioning of the immune and endocrine systems, which could constitute risk factors for later depression [7]. Early life stress in humans has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders in adult life, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, as well as somatic illnesses ranging from cardiovascular illness and diabetes to alterations at all levels of the brain–gut axis such as the altered balance of enteric microflora [25]. Early life stress is also known to induce long-term alterations in inflammatory responses, including elevated C-reactive-protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, Th1-like) [26]. Bipolar patients with a history of childhood trauma have a more severe form of illness characterised by earlier age at onset, suicide attempts, rapid cycling, an increased number of depressive episodes, and higher levels of inflammatory markers [27]. Adult vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases can thus be conceived as being imprinted during foetal and early postnatal periods through genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms [28]. It must be noted at this juncture that immune regulatory pathways do not operate singularly, but form part of a complex interacting network with other pathways, including, but not limited to, redox, neurogenesis/apoptosis, mitochondrial function and other stress response pathways [29]." "biomed_central"
"21" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "How to translate these findings into an agenda? A subgroup defined by history of severe and early stress could be identified by psychological and biological signatures associating, for instance, elevated levels of cytokines, cortisol and oxidative stress with specific clinical characteristics. These could be further refined by developmental animal models in which the phenotypic target of the pre/postnatal stress model, e.g. specific molecular, behavioural or cognitive deficit [30, 31], higher susceptibility to environmental challenges, or altered impact on risk and vulnerability pathways [32], will be defined. Life stressors are likely to occur at different periods, with different origins and intensities, and their impact could also be tested in these animal models. Furthermore, developmental stress implicates biological mechanisms in which numerous bodily systems, both peripheral and central, are engaged. Monitoring these parameters in classical pre/postnatal stress models and testing the resistance to stress after manipulations of these parameters will shed new light on how environmental challenges early in life may or may not alter resilience and vulnerability pathways. Finally, at-risk subjects exposed to early and/or chronic stressors could also be identified by their immunogenetic markers as known factors for higher risk of psychiatric disorders (see above). Collectively, we advocate herein that early identification of “high at-risk” subjects who underwent severe stress events during childhood will thus open the possibility of prevention strategies based on changeable environmental risk factors and restored balance in key biological systems."

"22" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Comorbidity between psychiatric and medical disorders is a major issue as it is estimated that approximately 70–90 % of individuals with bipolar disorder experience a concomitant psychiatric or somatic disorder [33]. Compared to the general population, metabolic syndrome is twice more common in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [34]. Further, an array of disorders is more commonly comorbid with depression (e.g. atopy, cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis and diabetes). Unsurprisingly, they all share an inflammatory component to their aetiology. Although these comorbid patterns have long been viewed as consequential to an unhealthy lifestyle or to the side effects of psychotropic drugs, it has been demonstrated that a pro-inflammatory signature, with elevated IL-1, IL-6, cortisol and leptin levels along with obesity, was observed in subjects already at risk of depressive, bipolar or psychotic disorders [35–37]. Similarly, the large majority of young subjects with autism spectrum disorders exhibit comorbid patterns, with more than 90 % suffering of gastrointestinal problems [38]. Abnormal metabolic and inflammatory signatures are thus associated with higher susceptibility for both comorbid medical and mental disorders [9]." "biomed_central"
"23" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "How to translate this observation into an agenda? Available data strongly suggests that currently defined psychiatric disorders could be either (or simultaneously) composed of diverse biological entities fitting under a same phenomenological spectrum umbrella or different phenomenological variants of a common underpinning pathophysiological process. First, we could use advanced methods, such as systems biology and theoretical “big data” bioinformatics, to identify new clusters of patients, integrating the complex phenotypic, anamnestic, psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, as well as familial and environmental risk factors, longitudinal history and biomarker profiling to shed light on these heterogeneous disorders [39]. The oncology field has successfully applied these techniques to evaluate the relevance of groups of factors and to identify bio-based clusters amenable to personalised treatment. Lifespan human and animal models that take into account the successive impact of environmental factors are also warranted to better understand the interactive and/or additive effect of these factors on the course of psychiatric disorders. Ideally, biological markers already identified in these disorders or extracted from the above emerging models in derivation studies could serve to design new “educated chips” that will contain immune, neurobiological and genetic markers defining subtypes of patients that could be further refined in validation studies (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Schematic illustration of the putative diversity within a psychiatric patient cohort (e.g. schizophrenic ones) diagnosed with a descriptive, and not mechanistic, nomenclature.

"25" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "The use of animal models could facilitate exploration of in-depth temporal and molecular pathways linking central and peripheral dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. For instance, since the discovery that some NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blockers induce schizophrenia-like psychosis, reproducing both positive and negative symptoms, the NMDA glutamatergic model of psychosis and schizophrenia has been increasingly accepted as part of the disease’s etiopathology [40]. The dysfunction of NMDAR signalling might originate, among other pathways, from genetic alteration, autoantibodies directed against extracellular epitopes [41–46], and/or altered levels of endogenous agonists/antagonists (kynurenine metabolites) [47]. Of note, the recent discovery that autoantibodies against extracellular epitopes of the NMDAR produce major psychosis [41–46] provides a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of psychotic disorders at the molecular, cellular and brain imaging levels. For instance, autoantibodies from anti-NMDA encephalitis patients altered NMDAR signalling by preventing molecular interaction and altering membrane trafficking of NMDAR, although without modulating the function of the NMDAR channel [43]. Thus, NMDAR dysfunction-induced psychosis could originate from a blockade of the channel (e.g. phencyclidine) or an altered trafficking of the receptor (e.g. autoantibodies). Future investigations in various psychotic disorders will thus shed new light on the mechanisms underlying these disorders and pave the way for new, innovative therapeutical strategies to restore proper NMDAR signaling." "biomed_central"
"26" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Could a common dysfunction be at the origin of peripheral disorders? Theoretically, yes. Indeed, it is often forgotten that NMDAR is not only expressed in brain cells but also in many other organs and cell types; for example, NMDAR is expressed in pancreatic islets and in insulin-secreting beta cells whose functional impairment contributes to diabetes. A recent study demonstrated that inhibition of NMDAR in mouse and human islet cells enhanced their glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and survival [48]. Thus, alterations in NMDAR signalling might directly confer risk for psychosis and diabetes. In addition, NMDAR is also expressed at the surface of epithelial barrier cells [49], monocytes [50] and lymphocytes [51], potentially regulating biological barriers and immune reactions. Finally, NMDAR is expressed by cardiac myocytes and cells of the basolateral proximal tubule in the kidney, and its activation in these systems produces important cellular and organ regulation (see [52] for a review). Thus, in addition to its well-established role in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders, alterations of NMDAR signalling could also sustain comorbid disorders in these patients (Fig. 2). Innovative and longitudinal models urgently need to be implemented in order to investigate the shared molecular pathways that could link comorbid somatic and psychiatric disorders as a whole.Fig. 2Example of the putative molecular link between medical comorbidities in psychotic disorders.

Improving our understanding of the biological networks and systems associated with these complex disorders as well as identifying mechanism-based subgroups among large and complex psychiatric entities would facilitate a shift towards target-based high-throughput screening of large compound libraries as advocated for drug discovery [1]. If it is confirmed that subgroups of patients are characterised by factors such as infections, autoimmunity, inflammation and immunogenetic-mediated response to environmental factors, then several existing agents could be prescribed on the basis of their actions on the immune system [54]. For example, toxoplasmosis is the most common protozoa parasite infecting people with psychiatric disorders, with a 2.7-fold increase in overall odds of T. gondii seropositivity [55], as recently confirmed by a meta-analysis showing an association with T. gondii antibodies (immunoglobulin type G) in schizophrenia and obsessive–compulsive disorder [56]. Remarkably, bipolar disorder and schizophrenic patients seropositive for T. gondii appear to have a better outcome when receiving antipsychotics with known in vitro anti-toxoplasmic activity when compared to patients receiving a treatment without anti-toxoplasmic activity [57]."

"29" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "One may also repurpose drugs that directly target inflammatory pathways to subgroups of patients with immune phenotypes. For instance, the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, which exhibits anti-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, glutamatergic and neurotrophic features, has been successfully tested in schizophrenia and major depressive disorders [58, 59]. Both aspirin [60] and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [59] reduce positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia when used as add-ons to standard antipsychotic therapy, whereas add-on celecoxib has anti-depressant effects [61]; the efficacy of NSAID therapy is now supported by meta-analysis [62]. N-acetylcysteine, which has redox, glutamatergic and anti-inflammatory properties, diminished symptom severity in add-on studies in schizophrenia and showed antidepressant effects in bipolar disorder and depression [63]. Ketamine and its metabolites worked in depression via their glutamatergic properties [64] as well as through robust effects on microglial suppression [65]. It is noteworthy that high inflammation has been shown to impair, to a certain extent, the action of antidepressants and antipsychotics [66, 67]. Thus, subgroups of psychiatric patients with infectious and inflammatory conditions should strongly benefit from adapted therapies, either with direct anti-inflammatory drugs or with antipsychotics with inherent anti-inflammatory properties."

"30" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "The discovery and development of new medications for clinically and immunologically stratified subgroups of patients would represent a major breakthrough in the field of psychiatric disorders. New targets for pathway-driven nosology will be as important for the future as the above refined strategies. One may envision that developing new modulators of specific cytokines (e.g. neutralising interleukins), products of infection-activated human endogenous retrovirus (e.g. HERV-W), or peripheral and central nervous system receptors (e.g. glutamate NMDAR subunits) would be of great interest for the subgroup of patients with these immune phenotypes. For instance, biological immunotherapy that directly targets cytokines such as IL-6 are worthy of interest since elevated levels of IL-6 have been reported in and may serve as markers of both schizophrenia and mood disorders [68]. As antibodies opposing the effects of IL-6 have been successfully developed for autoimmune diseases, they are promising candidates for psychiatric disorders, although probably only in the presence of immune abnormalities such as elevated levels of IL-6, autoantibodies and infectious stigma. Another targeted immunotherapy might be the use of antibodies neutralising the envelope protein of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-W, found elevated in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [69], since the neutralising antibody GNbAC1 abrogates the HERV-W envelope protein and has been successfully tested in clinical trials of patients with multiple sclerosis [70]."

"31" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Nevertheless, the immense efforts made over the past decades, in particular by major pharmaceutical companies, to target the neurotransmitter receptor signalling pathways extensively correlated to psychiatric disorders have not paid off. Two new lines of exploration could be envisioned. First, most efforts have concentrated on the development of drugs with a direct modulatory effect on the receptor, whereas an emerging array of evidence point toward a major defect of neurotransmitter receptor trafficking in brain cells. Focusing on innovative strategies to restore proper trafficking, and thus signalling, constitutes a promising research area. Second, the emerging functional interplay between synaptic and immune receptors, supposedly involved in brain connection maturation during development [71] and psychiatric disorders [72], should prompt us to build mechanistic and integrated models to leverage the immense potential of the genome-wide association studies highlighting the interconnection between neurotransmission and immunity in psychiatric disorders."

"32" "10.1186/s12916-016-0712-5" "Beyond the enormous economic burden that psychiatric disorders represent, the discovery of alterations in the intimate molecular networks that sustain the diseases and their application to develop novel therapeutic strategies is one of the most exciting and key scientific challenges for the 21st century. Here, we advocate that the path to discovery would first require a “deconstruction” of current practices to segment psychiatric disorders and we suggest elements of a research agenda to adapt clinical practice and foster research paradigms. The grounds for reconstruction should be based on the integration of a reconciled body–brain interface leading to a new “immuno-psychiatry-based nosology”. Indeed, the accumulating evidence that immune and environmental alterations play a key role in the aetiology of seemingly diverse disorders provides a promising opportunity to define latent subgroups that share immune, genetic and brain alterations. Innovative animal models are within our grasp to fully identify and properly address emerging obstacles. The opportunities for therapeutic strategies, both by re-purposing existing drugs and by identifying targets with new angles, may be immense and could provide the necessary hope that clinicians, pharmaceutical companies and, most importantly, patients may have gradually lost over the past decades."

"34" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "The new field of connectomics seeks to understand the brain by comprehensively mapping the anatomical and functional links between all its constituent neurons or larger scale brain regions [1]. The C. elegans nervous system has served as a prototype for analytical studies of connectome networks, since the synaptic connections made by each of its 302 neurons have been completely mapped at the level of electron microscopy [2, 3]. Through this approach, the C. elegans nervous system has been found to share a number of topological features in common with most other real-world networks, from human brain networks through social networks to the internet [1, 4, 5]. One well-known example is the small-world phenomenon, whereby networks are simultaneously highly clustered (nodes that are connected to each other are also likely to have many nearest neighbours in common) and highly efficient (the average path length between a pair of nodes is short) [6, 7]. Another characteristic feature of real-world networks which has attracted much attention is the existence of hubs or high-degree nodes, with many more connections to the rest of the network than expected in a random graph [8]. As in other networks, these topological features of the C. elegans connectome are thought to reflect the functional needs of the system [9, 10]. For example hubs are known to play a privileged role in coordinating functions across a distributed network [11], while the short path lengths (often mediated by the hubs) help increase the efficiency of information transfer across the network [6]." "plos"
"35" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Although connectomics has primarily focused on mapping the synaptic links between neurons, it is well established that chemical synapses are only one of several modes of interaction between neurons. For example, gap junctions, which mediate fast, potentially bidirectional electrical coupling between cells, are widespread in all nervous systems. Likewise, volume transmission and neurohumoral signalling provide means for local or long-range communication between neurons unconnected by synapses. As neuromodulators released through these routes can have profound effects on neural activity and behaviour [12–14], a full understanding of neural connectivity requires a detailed mapping of these extrasynaptic pathways." "plos"
"36" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "In C. elegans, as in many animals, one important route of neuromodulation is through monoamine signalling. Monoamines are widespread throughout phyla, with evidence that they are one of the oldest signalling systems, evolving at least 1 billion years ago [15]. In both humans and C. elegans, many neurons expressing aminergic receptors are not post-synaptic to releasing neurons, indicating that a significant amount of monoamine signalling occurs outside the wired connectome [16]. Monoamines are known to be essential for normal brain function, with abnormal signalling being implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions [17]. In C. elegans, these monoaminergic systems play similarly diverse roles in regulating locomotion, reproduction, feeding states, sensory adaptation, and learning [16]. Clearly, if the goal of connectomics is to understand behaviourally relevant communication within the brain, extrasynaptic monoamine interactions must also be mapped, not just the network of wired chemical synapses and gap junctions."

"37" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "In addition to monoamines, neuropeptides are also widely used as neuromodulators in the C. elegans nervous system. C. elegans contains over 250 known or predicted neuropeptides synthesized from at least 122 precursor genes, and over 100 putative peptide receptors [18, 19]. These include homologues of several well-known vertebrate neuropeptide receptors, including those for oxytocin/vasopressin (NTR-1), neuropeptide Y (NPR-1) and cholecystokinin (CKR-2) [19]. As in other animals, neuropeptide signalling is critical for nervous system function, and frequently involves hormonal or other extrasynaptic mechanisms." "plos"

We find that the extrasynaptic connectomes exhibit topological properties distinct from one another as well as from the wired connectome. Overall, the neuronal connectome can be modelled as a multiplex network with structurally distinct synaptic, gap junction, and extrasynaptic (neuromodulatory) layers representing neuronal interactions with different dynamics and polarity, and with critical interaction points allowing communication between layers. This network represents a prototype for understanding how neuromodulators interact with wired circuitry in larger nervous systems and for understanding the organisational principles of multiplex networks."

"39" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "To investigate the extent of extrasynaptic signalling in C. elegans monoamine systems, we systematically compared the expression patterns of monoamine receptors with the postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons. Monoamine-producing cells were identified based on the published expression patterns of appropriate biosynthetic enzymes and vesicular transporters (see Methods). The expression patterns for each of five serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-5, ser-7 and mod-1), three octopamine receptors (octr-1, ser-3 and ser-6), four tyramine receptors (ser-2, tyra-2, tyra-3 and lgc-55), and four dopamine receptors (dop-1, dop-2, dop-3 and dop-4) were compiled from published data (see S1–S7 Tables).

Additional expression profiling using a transgenic lgc-53 reporter line crossed to a series of known reference strains indicated that lgc-53 is expressed in a small subset of neurons in the head, body and tail (Fig 1). Together with the published dop-1, dop-2, dop-3 and dop-4-expressing cells, these were inferred to make up the domain of dopamine-responding neurons. In addition, two G-protein coupled receptors, dop-5 and dop-6, have been hypothesized based on sequence similarity to dop-3 to be dopamine receptors. Using the same approach used for lgc-53, we identified most of the cells with clear expression of dop-5 and dop-6 reporters (Fig 1). These cells were included in a broader provisional dopamine network, the analysis of which is presented in the supplemental material (S1 Fig, S3 Fig)." "plos"

For example, the two tyraminergic neurons, RIML and RIMR, are presynaptic to a total of 20 neurons. Yet of the 114 neurons that express reporters for one or more of the four tyramine (TA) receptors, only 7 are postsynaptic to a tyraminergic neuron (Fig 2A; Table 1). Thus, approximately 94% of tyramine-responsive neurons must respond only to extrasynaptic TA. Similar analyses of the other monoamine systems yield comparable results: 100% of neurons expressing octopamine receptors receive no synaptic input from octopamine-releasing neurons (Fig 2B), while 82% of neurons expressing dopamine receptors, and 76% of neurons expressing serotonin receptors receive no synaptic input from neurons expressing the cognate monoamine ligand (Table 1). Thus, most neuronal monoamine signalling in C. elegans appears to occur extrasynaptically, outside the wired synaptic connectome.

For the serotonin network, only those neurons with strong, consistent expression of serotonin biosynthetic markers such as tryptophan hydroxylase were included (NSM, HSN and ADF). Additional neurons (AIM, RIH, VC4/5) that appear to take up serotonin but not synthesize it [23][24] were not included in the network, since they may function primarily in the homeostatic clearing of serotonin.

For example, chemical synapses represent unidirectional, wired connections that signal on a fast (ms) time scale, while gap junctions generate reciprocal electrical connections that function on an even faster time scale. In contrast, monoamine connections are wireless (with a single sending cell broadcasting to multiple receivers), slow (acting on a time scale of seconds or longer) and unidirectional [22, 27].

In contrast, we observe that out of 1940 monoamine connections only 80 overlap with chemical or electrical synapses, meaning 96% of the monoamine connections are unique to the monoamine layer (Fig 2C; Table 1). Reducibility analysis [28], which clusters the different network layers based on their redundancy or degree of overlap, provides further support that the monoamine networks have a unique structure. Considered either separately or in the aggregate, the monoamines form a distinct cluster separate from the wired synaptic and gap junction networks (Fig 3A and 3B).

While the synaptic and gap junction layers of the worm connectome are observed to follow this trend, with the same high-degree neurons in both systems (Fig 3C), the extrasynaptic monoamine network exhibits a vastly different structure. While the synaptic and gap junction degrees of individual nodes show high positive correlation (R = .594), no significant degree-degree correlation is observed between the wired and extrasynaptic monoamine layers, indicating that the hubs of the monoamine system are distinct. These analyses suggest two distinct interpretations for the dissimilarity to the wired network layers. Firstly, monoamines may be functioning as an independent network, with little relation to the faster wired network. Secondly, the dissimilarity between layers might indicate that monoamines have a complementary function that is nevertheless coupled to that of the synaptic and gap junction connections." "plos"
"51" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "To address these possibilities, we investigated whether the isolated C. elegans monoamine network displays the structural organisation required for information processing. Considered separately, the monoamine networks of C. elegans consist of only a few topologically central neurons that broadcast signals to a large number of peripheral neurons. These monoamine-releasing cells are mostly sensory and motor neurons, with the downstream receptors being distributed throughout the worm (Fig 3D). In total, 18 of the 302 neurons in the adult hermaphrodite release monoamines, while 251 neurons (83%) were found to express one or more monoamine receptors. This gives the network a star-like topology, which can be directly observed in all of the separate monoamine networks (Fig 4A, S1 Fig). As a consequence, the monoamine network exhibits a heavy tailed distribution containing a small number of high-degree hubs (Fig 3C). This structure is also reflected in other topological network measures, with the monoamine network exhibiting high disassortativity characteristic of star networks (Fig 4B). Disassortativity is known to be relevant in the organisation of collective network dynamics, such as synchronisation [29] and cooperation behaviour [30, 31], and is widely observed in other biological and technological networks [32]. The star-like structure of the monoamine layer was also confirmed by three-neuron motif analysis, which revealed the enrichment of a motif consisting of a hub node signalling to two spokes (S2 Fig)."

"53" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "The inclusion of these additional monoamine connections into the connectome has a number of effects on the aggregate network. For one, it greatly reduces the overall path length of the network (Fig 4C), increasing the efficiency of integrative information processing by providing paths between more segregated subgraphs of the wired network [33]. In particular, monoamine signalling provides a direct route of communication between sensory neurons and motor neurons (Fig 3D), bypassing the premotor interneurons that play a prominent role in the synaptic and gap junction systems [11]. Together, these observations suggest that the monoamines provide efficient global connections for coordinating behaviour throughout the entire organism due to the presence of highly connected hubs directly linking many disparate parts of the network. This is a useful feature given the role of monoamines in signalling physiologically important states relevant to the entire organism, such as food availability [27]. The increased connectivity provided by the monoamines also results in a reduction in the aggregate network's modular structure, a consequence of increasing the number of connections between functionally segregated units (Fig 4D). The network is, however, still more modular than random, with the monoamine layer also exhibiting greater-than-random modularity compared to null models that rewire the network edges while preserving degree distribution (see Methods). This is expected given the monoamine layer's composition from separate signalling systems; indeed the individual monoamine networks considered on their own show very low modularity (S1 Fig)." "plos"
"54" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Despite the hub-and-spoke structure of the extrasynaptic network, the monoamine layer exhibits a significant level of global clustering (measured here as transitivity) (Fig 4E). This observation is explained by two factors. Firstly, the expression of monoamine receptors by releasing neurons creates a central cluster of hub neurons in the network; secondly, as many neurons also express more than one monoamine receptor, triangles are formed in the network with a receiving neuron as one vertex, and two transmitting neurons as the others. Indeed, three-neuron motif analysis confirmed that this configuration is overrepresented in all the monoamine networks save tyramine (S2 Fig). This structure provides a method of dual lateral inhibition, where a releasing neuron can inhibit antagonistic signals from another hub neuron while simultaneously negating the downstream effects of those signals, a pattern previously observed in the OA/TA and 5-HT systems between RIC/RIM & NSM in the aminergic control of feeding behaviours [34]. Similar patterns also exist within individual monoamine layers; for example, the ventral cord motor neurons express both excitatory (dop-1) and inhibitory (dop-3) dopamine receptors [35], while the expression of an inhibitory receptor (dop-2) in dopamine-releasing neurons suggests that the hubs mutually suppress one another to regulate dopamine release."

It was previously shown that the C. elegans wired connectome includes a rich-club consisting primarily of a small number of premotor interneurons, controlling forward and backward locomotion [11]. Subjecting the monoamine connectome to similar analysis, it was found that this network also contains a distinct rich-club (Fig 5A and 5B; Table 3), consisting of dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine-releasing neurons. The rich-club property stems from the fact that most serotonergic neurons contain receptors for both tyramine and dopamine, while dopaminergic and tyraminergic neurons likewise express receptors for the other two aminergic transmitters (Fig 5B), suggesting that the different monoamines coordinate their actions. This rich-club structure is also reflected in the 3-neuron motif analysis, in which the fully-connected motif was overrepresented in the aggregate monoamine layer (S2 Fig).

We focused on 12 neuropeptide receptors with well-established ligands (with biologically-plausible EC50 values in in vitro assays) and precisely-characterized expression patterns for both receptor and peptide precursor genes (S8 Table, S9 Table). Networks were classified by receptor, allowing many-to-many relationships between neuropeptides and receptors. Even for this partial network, 239 neurons are seen to be involved in neuropeptide signalling (out of 302 possible) with 7035 connections between them, providing greater connectivity than either the synaptic or monoamine layers. Of the receptor-expressing neurons, almost 60% received no synaptic input from neurons expressing one of their ligands, suggesting that at least for this partial network, neuropeptide signalling, like monoamine signalling, is largely extrasynaptic.

On the other hand, the neuropeptide network has much higher clustering than any other connectome layer (Fig 4E), and is significantly less disassortative (Fig 4B) than the monoamine network. In part, this is an expected consequence of the large number of connections in the neuropeptide network; however, the observed clustering in the neuropeptide network was significantly higher even than null models with the same edge density.

Indeed, the premotor interneuron DVA is a receiver for serotonin, tyramine and (provisionally) dopamine signalling, while the tyraminergic RIMs are highly connected to the premotor interneurons of the wired rich-club. As one might expect from their topological role in linking the monoamine and wired network layers, the RIMs have been shown in a number of studies to play a central role in the modulation of sensory pathways in response to feeding states as well as the control of downstream locomotion motor programs [41–43]. Similarly RIB, which expresses receptors for serotonin and dopamine, is thought to integrate numerous sensory signals [44, 45] and has been demonstrated to influence reorientation in foraging behaviour [46]."

"64" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Multilink motif analysis provides another approach for investigating the interactions between the synaptic, gap junction and monoamine layers [47]. Since each layer contains the same set of nodes but a different pattern of edges, the frequencies with which different combinations of links co-occur between pairs of nodes throughout the multiplex network can be determined. Of the 20 possible multilink motifs, seven were found to be overrepresented and four underrepresented compared to networks composed from randomized layers (Fig 7). Many of these do not involve monoamines; for example, three overrepresented motifs–reciprocal chemical synapses (motif 3) and the co-occurrence of a gap junction with a single or reciprocal chemical synapse (motifs 5 & 6)–have been reported in an earlier analysis of the wired network [5]. These also align with results from the degree-degree correlation and reducibility (Fig 3A, 3B and 3C) indicating that synapses and gap junctions frequently overlap. This is mirrored in the underrepresentation of motifs 2 & 4 corresponding to synapses or gap junctions alone; conversely, the underrepresentation of these single link motifs leads to an overrepresentation of unlinked pairs (motif 1)."

The most interesting (and statistically significant) of these corresponds to a unidirectional monoamine link coincident with reciprocal synaptic connections (motif 10). The structure of this motif is well-suited to provide positive or negative feedback in response to experience, suggesting that this may be a functionally important aspect of monoamine activity within the wider network. Indeed, connections of this type (Table 6) have been implicated in a number of C. elegans behaviours; for example, motif 10 connections between ADF and AIY have been shown to be important for the learning of pathogen avoidance [48] and connections between RIM and RMD are important for the suppression of head movements during escape behaviour [49].

Indeed, when we considered the monoamine networks separately (e.g. Syn-Gap-DA or Syn-Gap-TA multilink), motif 10 was overrepresented for multilink containing either serotonin and dopamine (Fig 7C and 7D, S3 Fig), but not for tyramine or octopamine (Fig 7E, S3 Fig). Interestingly, two different motifs were found to be overrepresented in the 3-layer octopamine network (Fig 7E, S11 Table), motif 9 (a unidirectional synaptic connection coincident with an octopamine connection in the opposite direction) and motif 11 (a unidirectional octopamine link coincident with a gap junction).

When the neuropeptide network was included in the multiplex participation analysis, we observed that the RIM and DVA neurons continue to play central roles in linking the four network layers (S12 Table). Likewise, multilink motif analysis, this time using the neuropeptide and wired layers, again identified motif 10 (a unidirectional neuromodulatory connection coincident with a reciprocal synaptic connection) as significantly overrepresented, further supporting the notion that this motif plays a key role in extrasynaptic modulation of synaptic computation (S3 Fig; S13 Table). Even more highly overrepresented relative to expectation was motif 20, reciprocal neuropeptide and synaptic connections coincident with a gap junction. This motif was not overrepresented in the multilink analysis for monoamines, perhaps because of the low reciprocity of the monoamine network. Interestingly, several of the motif 20 multilink (S14 Table) are components of the RMG hub and spoke network, which has been implicated in the control of various behaviours including locomotion, aggregation, and pheromone response [51, 52]."

"71" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "This study has analysed the properties of an expanded C. elegans neuronal connectome, which incorporates newly-compiled networks of extrasynaptic monoamine and neuropeptide signalling. Analyses reveal that these extrasynaptic networks have structures distinct from the synaptic network, and from one another. The monoamine network has a highly disassortative, star-like topology, with a small number of high-degree broadcasting hubs interconnected to form a rich-club core. The monoamine systems are thus well-suited to broadly coordinate global neural and behavioural states across the connectome. Although the partial neuropeptide network we analyse is only a small sample of the complete network, it shows a different, highly clustered topology with higher reciprocity, suggesting the importance of these neuropeptide systems in the cohesion of the nervous system. While these extrasynaptic networks are separate and non-overlapping with the wired connectome, the hubs of both the wired and wireless networks are interconnected, with multilink motifs showing interaction between the systems at specific points in the network. This suggests that the extrasynaptic networks function both independently–coordinating for example through the monoamine rich-club–and in unison with the synaptic network through multilayer hubs such as RIM and through overrepresented multilink motifs." "plos"
"72" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "The low degree of overlap between the monoamine and synaptic networks occurs not only because many neurons expressing monoamine receptors are not postsynaptic to aminergic neurons, but also because many postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons to not appear to express monoamine receptors. Some of these synapses could be explained by cotransmission; in particular, tyraminergic and serotonergic neurons also express either cholinergic or glutaminergic markers, and thus classical transmitters could be used in these wired synapses. However, the dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons of C. elegans are not known to coexpress any classical neurotransmitter. A second possibility is that these synapses could utilize synaptically-released peptides as neurotransmitters. A third possibility is that the postsynaptic cells might express either an unknown monoamine receptor, or a known one at levels too low to be detected using existing reporters. Finally, it is possible that these putative synapses, which have been identified on the basis of electron micrographs, are not really functional synapses. Further work will be necessary to resolve this puzzling question." "plos"
"73" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "The importance of extrasynaptic neuromodulation to the function of neural circuits is clearly established, for example from work on crustacean stomatogastric circuits [13]. However, systematic attempts to map whole-organism connectomes have focused primarily on chemical synapses, with even gap junctions being difficult to identify using high-throughput electron microscopy approaches [53]. The incorporation of extrasynaptic neuromodulatory interactions, inferred here from gene expression data, adds a large number of new links largely non-overlapping with those of the wired connectome. Although the valence and strength of these inferred neuromodulatory links are largely unknown (information also lacking for much of the synaptic connectome), the monoamine and neuropeptide networks described here nonetheless provide a far more complete picture of potential pathways of communication between different parts of the C. elegans nervous system."

"74" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Although monoamine and neuropeptide signalling both occur extrasynaptically and act on similar timescales, the monoamine and neuropeptide networks show distinct topologies, perhaps reflecting differences in biological function. As noted previously, the monoamine network has a star-like architecture that is qualitatively different to the other network layers. This structure is reflected in the network's high disassortativity and in the low number of recurrent connections. In addition, we observed that the monoamine network contains a rich-club of highly interconnected high-degree releasing neurons, whose members are distinct from (though linked to) the rich-club of the wired connectome. Together, this structure is well-suited to the organisation of collective network dynamics, and is a useful feature given the role of monoamines in signalling physiologically important states relevant to the entire organism, such as food availability." "plos"
"75" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Despite enormous differences in scale, the monoamine systems of C. elegans and mammals share a number of common properties suggestive of common network topology. As in C. elegans, mammalian brains contain a relatively small number of monoamine-releasing neurons that project widely to diverse brain regions; for example, in humans serotonin is produced by less than 100,000 cells in the raphe nuclei, or one millionth of all brain neurons [54]. Moreover, extrasynaptic volume transmission is thought to account for much, if not most, monoamine signalling throughout the mammalian brain [55, 56]. Parallels between monoamine systems in C. elegans and larger nervous systems are not exact; for example, in C. elegans, most if not all aminergic neurons appear capable of long-distance signalling, whereas monoamines in larger nervous systems can be restricted by glial diffusion barriers [57]. Nonetheless, mammalian monoamine-releasing neurons, like their C. elegans counterparts, appear to function as high-degree broadcasting hubs with functionally and spatially diverse targets [54]. Thus, understanding how such hubs act within the context of the completely mapped wired circuitry of C. elegans, may provide useful insights into the currently unknown structures of multilayer neuronal networks in larger animals."

"76" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "Although the neuropeptide network has been only partially characterized, the partial network analysed here suggests it may differ in important ways from the other connectome layers, including the monoamine network. In particular, the neuropeptide layer shows strikingly high clustering, even taking into account its high density of connections, and higher reciprocity than the monoamine network. These properties suggest the neuropeptide networks are important for cohesiveness within the nervous system. Multilink analysis also identified differences between the extrasynaptic monoamine and neuropeptide networks. In both cases, a unidirectional extrasynaptic connection coincident with a reciprocal synaptic connection (motif 10) was overrepresented in the multiplex connectome. This motif is well-suited to provide feedback between linked nodes, and occurs in several microcircuits implicated in learning and memory. For neuropeptides, a second multilink motif, involving reciprocal neuromodulatory and synaptic connections coincident with a gap junction (motif 20) was even more highly overrepresented. This motif occurs in several places in the RMG-centred hub-and-spoke circuit that plays a key role in control of aggregation and arousal. As more neuropeptide systems become characterized, it is reasonable to expect additional examples of this motif will be identified; these may likewise have important computational roles in key neural circuits."

The synaptic, gap junction, and monoamine layers already represent a relatively reliable and complete mapping of three distinct connection types. The lack of degree-degree correlation between some of these layers suggests that they are not just different facets of one true underlying network (such that each edge is essentially duplicated across all layers). Rather, it suggests that the wired and wireless layers provide distinct channels of communication with differing functional roles. We therefore expect wired and wireless connections to be coupled in functionally relevant 3-node and 4-node motif structures [59, 60], such as (for example) monoamine-based feedback loops or monoamine-regulated wired interactions. The different time-scales on which each of the layers operates are also likely to allow the emergence of interesting dynamical phenomena.

"80" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "How feasible is it to obtain a complete multiplex neuronal connectome? Although the neuropeptide network described here represents only a sample of the total network, the monoamine network already represents a reasonable draft of a complete monoamine connectome. Since expression patterns for amine receptors have been based on reporter coexpression with well-characterized markers, the rate of false positives (i.e. neurons falsely identified as monoamine receptor expressing) is probably very low. In contrast, the false-negative rate (monoamine receptor-expressing cells not included in the network) is almost certainly somewhat higher. In some cases (e.g. dop-4 and dop-3 in ASH [27, 61]), reporter transgenes appear to underreport full functional expression domains; in others (e.g. ser-5) only a subset of cells expressing a particular reporter have been identified [62]. With recently developed marker strains [60, 63], it should be possible to revisit cell identification and fill in at least some of these missing gaps. In addition, other monoamines (e.g. melatonin [64]) might function as neuromodulators in C. elegans, and some of the currently uncharacterized orphan receptors in the worm genome [19] might respond to monoamines. Potentially, some of these receptors might be expressed in postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons (in particular, those of dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons, which are not known to express classical neurotransmitters). However, the existence of additional monoamine receptor-expressing cells also means that non-synaptic edges are almost certainly undercounted in the network. Thus, the high degree of monoamine releasing hubs–and their importance for intraneuronal signalling outside the wired connectome–is if anything understated by the current findings." "plos"
"81" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283" "In the future, it should be possible to expand the scope of the multilayer connectome to gain a more complete picture of intraneuronal functional connectivity. Obtaining extrasynaptic connectomes for larger brains, especially those of mammals, will likely be vastly more complicated than for C. elegans, due not only to the increase in size, but also the existence of additional structural and dynamical properties, such as glial barriers, cellular swelling, and arterial pulsations, all of which dynamically alter extracellular diffusion [65, 66]. In contrast, reanalysis of reporters for monoamine receptors using recently developed reference strains [60, 63] could provide a largely complete monoamine signalling network for C. elegans. A greater challenge would be to obtain a complete neuropeptide network; this would require comprehensive de-orphanization of neuropeptide GPCRs as well as expression patterns for hundreds of receptor and peptide genes. Additional layers of neuronal connectivity also remain unmapped, such as extrasynaptic signalling by insulin-like peptides, purines, and classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA [67–69]. Obtaining this information, while difficult, is uniquely feasible in C. elegans given the small size and precise cellular characterisation of its nervous system.

"156" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "The dedifferentiation theory of cognitive aging proposes that there is a loss of specificity of neural representations as people become older. These pervasive changes are assumed to impact predominantly on the complex cognitive functions which decline the most (Baltes and Lindenberger, 1997, Li et al., 2001). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed widespread age-related reductions in the specificity of distributed cortical patterns of activity elicited by different categories of visual stimuli (Carp et al., 2010b, Goh et al., 2010, Park et al., 2004) and different actions (Carp et al., 2011). Preliminary evidence also supports the prediction that dedifferentiation impacts on functions and regions which decline prominently in old age: the visual category-specificity of cortical activity patterns correlates with older adults' fluid processing ability, and varies with working memory load in frontal and parietal cortex (Carp et al., 2010a, Park et al., 2010, Payer et al., 2006). However, little is currently known about the mechanisms of dedifferentiation, nor its impact on episodic memory, one of the cognitive functions most affected by aging. We investigated whether memory representations are less specific in older adults and explored the modulation of memory specificity by dopaminergic drugs." "academic_press"
"157" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Normal aging is accompanied by a marked decline in detailed recollection of events, and an increase in false memory (Schacter et al., 1997, Spencer and Raz, 1995). These episodic memory difficulties are typically attributed to declines in the integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (e.g., Head et al., 2008, Yonelinas et al., 2007). However, regional age-related changes may be secondary to generalized neural changes such as dedifferentiation. The first aim of the present study was to examine whether the specificity of episodic reinstatement differs according to age. Episodic recollection is thought to involve hippocampal reactivation of stored memory traces which represent events' particular sensory and cognitive properties (Alvarez and Squire, 1994, McClelland et al., 1995). Consistent with this, functional imaging studies show that successful episodic memory retrieval is accompanied by reinstatement of cortical activity associated with the original events (Danker and Anderson, 2010). Studies using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have further shown that the specificity of this episodic reinstatement for particular tasks and categories of stimuli varies with strategic memory search and with competition between relevant and irrelevant memories, suggesting that it reflects the specificity of recollection (Kuhl et al., 2011, McDuff et al., 2009). Using MVPA, St-Laurent et al. (2014) recently showed less distinctive cortical reinstatement in older adults for individual items. We examined the specificity of distributed patterns of reinstatement for two different encoding task contexts involving semantic and phonological processing (Johnson et al., 2009, Polyn et al., 2005). We then determined the degree to which distinct task-related activity patterns present during encoding were reinstated during subsequent retrieval, predicting that this measure of memory specificity would be reduced in older relative to younger adults." "academic_press"
"158" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "According to computational models, age-related dedifferentiation may reflect a reduction in dopamine signaling and neural signal-to-noise in prefrontal cortex (PFC; Li et al., 2001), and potentially elsewhere. Modeling dedifferentiation in this way reproduces disruption of episodic binding functions found in older adults (Li et al., 2005). This is in line with wider evidence of a ‘correlative triad’ between aging, cognition and dopamine function (Bäckman et al., 2006). The second aim of the present study was to extend the findings of our previous report, which examined dopaminergic modulations of brain activity associated with successful episodic encoding across the two encoding tasks (Morcom et al., 2010). The study had a cross-over placebo-controlled design, in which we administered a dopamine agonist (Bromocriptine) and an antagonist (Sulpiride) to manipulate dopamine signaling. Morcom et al. (2010) found age-related differences in dopaminergic effects on activity associated with successful episodic encoding in PFC and hippocampus. This dopaminergic sensitivity was most pronounced in the older adults with poorer memory, consistent with the notion that dopaminergic decline impairs the ability to encode new memories. Specifically, there were reversed subsequent memory (subsequent forgetting) effects within MTL in the older group: i.e., encoding phase activity predicted later forgetting rather than remembering (Morcom et al., 2010). We proposed then that older adults may encode less distinctive memory representations which do not support specific recollection (Morcom et al., 2010, Wagner and Davachi, 2001)." "academic_press"
"159" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "This novel joint analysis of task-specific activity at encoding and its reinstatement at retrieval allowed us directly to test the link between dopamine, aging and dedifferentiation of episodic memory. We predicted that the expected age-related reduction in memory specificity would vary with changes in dopamine signaling. If dopaminergic decline causes dedifferentiation, loss of memory specificity should be dopamine-sensitive. Predictions about the nature of this sensitivity were derived from the results of the successful encoding study (Morcom et al., 2010) and the dopamine aging hypothesis. First, we expected that dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity would track individual differences in memory ability in the older group, and that poorer older performers would show greater dopamine sensitivity, distinguishing them from the young. Second, we predicted that the dopaminergic effect on memory specificity would parallel that previously reported for the univariate memory encoding (subsequent memory) effects. In addition, if the reversed, subsequent forgetting, effects in the older group reflected impaired memory specificity as proposed by Morcom et al. (2010), then Bromocriptine should reduce memory specificity in poorer older performers just as it enhanced subsequent forgetting effects." "academic_press"

To avoid nausea within the double-blind procedure, the study drug was given with 10 mg of the peripheral dopamine antagonist Domperidone (Reddymasu et al., 2007).

"167" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using WFU PickAtlas (http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/).

Prefrontal ROIs were defined for each hemisphere separately (LIFG, RIFG, LMFG & RMFG), as age-related differences in lateralization of memory function in PFC were of potential interest (Morcom, 2003, Cabeza, 2002). Within each ROI, we used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) feature selection utility in the Princeton toolbox to select voxels showing the most significant differences between the two task conditions (semantic and phonological) in each training (encoding phase) dataset. In order to check whether MVPA results varied according to the threshold used for feature selection, we generated 3 separate feature sets for each training dataset and ROI, comprising the 500, 150 and 50 most significant voxels. For each ROI, the best performing feature set in the Placebo condition ridge regression analysis of task specificity (encoding) effects was then used for all subsequent analyses of memory specificity and drug effects, and for the correlation analysis (see Multi-voxel pattern analysis: age-related differences, Task specificity, Multi-voxel pattern analysis: age-related differences, Task specificity, below)."

"168" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate the specificity of the patterns of neural activity in the semantic and phonological encoding tasks (task specificity), and the specificity with which information encoded using these two tasks was later retrieved (memory specificity). Machine learning algorithms are now widely used to decode neural activity (Polyn et al., 2005, Haynes and Rees, 2006, Kamitani and Tong, 2005). The fidelity with which they can discriminate between two cognitive conditions provides a measure of the distinctiveness of different patterns of neural activation. MVPA measures were computed for each subject and drug condition using the Princeton MVPA toolbox (Norman et al., 2006, Detre et al., 2006; http://www.pni.princeton.edu/mvpa/). We used a penalized ridge regression algorithm because of its sensitivity to intermediate activation values at training and at test, and its ability to compensate for multicollinearity among features (Coutanche et al., 2011, Zhang and Yang, 2003, Poppenk and Norman, 2012). This means that predictions of test set data are continuous rather than binary. To assess the performance of the algorithm for each subject and drug session we calculated the correlation coefficient of its predictions with the labels of the testing set using the inbuilt performance metrics in the Princeton's toolbox, giving test set data values from − 1 to 1 (chance = 0)."

Subjects' encoding timeseries were subdivided into 8 equal subsets, each comprising one mini-block. To account for hemodynamic lag the design was convolved with SPM8's canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). A ridge regression algorithm was then trained on 7 of these subsets and tested on the 8th in a leave-one-out cross validation procedure with 8 iterations. Before application of the algorithm to the test data, we ran a nested cross-validation procedure on the training data for the Placebo condition to determine the optimum values for the ridge regression penalty parameter which controls the maximum value of the sum of the squares of the voxel weights (Coutanche et al., 2011). The optimum value within the range (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000) did not differ between age groups (median value across ROIs and selected feature sets in both groups = 50; interquartile range = 130, for Kruskal–Wallis tests in each ROI for selected feature sets, p > .05).

Memory specificity was defined as the accuracy with which the algorithms trained to discriminate between the encoding tasks were able to predict the retrieval task in each ROI. For this analysis, all 8 pairs of encoding mini-blocks were used as training data, and each retrieval phase's 9 pairs of mini-blocks served as 2 independent test runs. Memory specificity measures were computed for both retrieval phases and the final measure of memory specificity for each subject and drug session was the average performance of the ridge regressor across the two phases. We note that because the encoding and retrieval mini-blocks contained different numbers of trials (15 and 10, see above), this difference could contribute to lower values for memory specificity than for task specificity. However, scan numbers and therefore data points available for the ridge analysis were closely similar between the two phases (37.5 and 36.6). Moreover, an overall difference between levels of task specificity and memory specificity was expected, since they are assumed to reflect very different processes (see Introduction)."

"171" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "To check the reproducibility of the ridge regression results and for comparability with prior studies of dedifferentiation in aging, we also measured memory specificity using a correlation distance metric of neural distinctiveness (Carp et al., 2010b, Haxby et al., 2001). To allow for hemodynamic delay, the fixation scans and the first 7 scans of each mini-block were discarded giving 30 scans from each encoding and retrieval mini-block. Voxel values were then averaged across the remaining scans in each semantic and phonological task mini-block for the study and test phases, and across mini-blocks, and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients computed within and between tasks between the encoding phase and the retrieval phase. Memory specificity was defined as the neural distinctiveness of activity patterns in the two different tasks across the two phases of the episodic memory task. Memory specificity was calculated as the difference between the average correlation within similar tasks (semantic encoding & semantic retrieval and phonological encoding & phonological retrieval) and the average correlation between different tasks (semantic encoding & phonological retrieval and phonological encoding & semantic retrieval)."

The pattern of findings was unchanged in this larger sample. Performance on the two orienting tasks in the study phase did not differ according to age group or drug condition, and both groups were highly accurate (90% for young, 89% for old). In the test phase, the main index of memory performance was the discrimination index Pr for hits and false alarms, collapsed over Remember and Know responses (Phit − Pfalse alarm, Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988). Pr did not differ between age groups on Placebo (t < 1), but there was a main effect of drug with a linear trend (F(1.8, 53.6) = 3.29, p = 0.049; F(1,29) = 4.26, p = .048), mainly reflecting a reduction in Pr on Sulpiride across both groups (mean = 0.43) relative to Placebo and Bromocriptine (means = 0.47;). As in the previously reported sub-group of subjects, although this effect did not interact with age (F(1.8, 53.6) = 1.33), it was driven mainly by a reliable linear effect of drug in the older group taken alone. (Response bias, as indexed with Br (Pfalse alarm / 1 − (Phit − Pfalse alarm), (Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988)), was also more liberal on Sulpiride (mean = 0.46; for Placebo and Bromocriptine, means = 0.38 and 0.41; values > 0.5 indicate a relatively liberal bias to respond “old”). Valid recollection and familiarity measures were available for a subset of 16 young and 13 older adults; these did not show reliable drug or group effects. In addition, the depth of processing effect (better memory following semantic than phonological encoding; Craik and Lockhart, 1972) did not differ between groups (mean probability of recollection = .53 and .28 in the young respectively, and .50 and .27 in the older group; age effects n.s.) or as a result of the pharmacological manipulation."

We then tested for brain–behavior associations using ANCOVA with the additional covariates of Pr (on Placebo) and Pr x group (see Task specificity and Feature selection, Task specificity and Feature selection). Where covariate effects were present, we checked that these remained significant when individual age was also included in the model, to rule out potential confounds between performance- and age-related effects within groups (Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001).

"205" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Our results show that contextual reinstatement during episodic memory retrieval is less specific in older adults, as predicted by the dedifferentiation account of cognitive aging (Carp et al., 2010b, Li et al., 2001, Park et al., 2004). The data support the proposal that age-related dedifferentiation impacts on episodic memory and impairs memory specificity (Li et al., 2005, St-Laurent et al., 2014). In both young and older age groups, highly specific distributed patterns of neural activity distinguished the processing of semantic and phonological task contexts during the encoding phase, but reinstatement of these task-related patterns at retrieval – memory specificity – was reduced in the older adults in PFC and hippocampus. This reduction in the distinctiveness of retrieved representations was not accounted for by age-related differences in the specificity with which the original task contexts were represented. Task specificity and memory specificity also showed dissociable dopaminergic sensitivity with age-invariant and age-dependent effects, respectively. In hippocampus, memory specificity varied linearly with dopamine stimulation in the older group and this modulation tracked individual differences in memory performance. The dopaminergic effect in hippocampus was distinct from a generalized age-invariant increase in task specificity on both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine. Our data support the notion that dopaminergic function in old age impacts hippocampal memory processes (Chowdhury et al., 2012, Kaasinen et al., 2000, Morcom et al., 2010, Stemmelin et al., 2000, Wilson et al., 2006)." "academic_press"
"206" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Findings in hippocampus under Placebo were as predicted. The robust reinstatement of task-specific activity during episodic retrieval in the young group is consistent with recent reports that elements of specific memory traces within the hippocampus are reactivated during recollection (Chadwick et al., 2011, Staresina et al., 2012; but see Ritchey et al., 2013), although at the current spatial resolution activity in adjacent cortical regions cannot be excluded. Hippocampal reinstatement was not detectable in the older adults, even though distinctiveness of the original two task contexts was, if anything, slightly greater in this group. This is the first report of an age-related reduction in memory specificity in hippocampus and the first to use trial-unique stimuli, converging with recent findings in cortical regions for reinstatement at the level of individual items (St-Laurent et al., 2014). Models of hippocampal function specify that it is critical for the pattern separation of distinct memory traces for highly similar events and their later reinstatement by pattern completion (Marr, 1982, O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994, Treves and Rolls, 1994), functions which appear to be compromised in aging (Wilson et al., 2006, Yassa et al., 2011)." "academic_press"
"207" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "It is important to note that the group difference in neural memory specificity did not reflect a simple absence of recollection in the older adults: recollective experience was just as likely in this group, and received the same boost from semantic as opposed to phonological processing. Instead, the findings indicate a reduction in the distinctiveness of reinstatement assumed to support contextual recollection (Danker and Anderson, 2010, St-Laurent et al., 2014). Recovery of episodic detail is typically impoverished in older adults even when subjective recollection occurs (e.g. Levine et al., 2002). Our findings indicate that the decline in recollection of episodic detail in old age (Schacter et al., 1997, Spencer and Raz, 1995) is accompanied by a reduction in the distinctiveness of contextual representations. The data suggest an age-related reduction in the specificity of hippocampal encoding, storage and/or retrieval of these representations which impacts on their later reinstatement during recollection." "academic_press"
"208" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Age-related reductions in memory specificity in left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC were prominent while memory specificity was age-invariant in LSOG. However, the data do not necessarily suggest selective anterior changes as predicted by the frontal aging hypothesis (West, 1996): although group differences were not clear cut in fusiform gyrus, memory specificity in that region was numerically greater in the young and non-significant in the older adults, consistent with other studies (Carp et al., 2010a, Carp et al., 2010b, Carp et al., 2011, Goh et al., 2010, Park et al., 2010, Park et al., 2012, St-Laurent et al., 2014). Critically, as in hippocampus, the group differences in cortical memory specificity were task-dependent: representations of task context in the encoding phase were well-differentiated in both age groups, unlike contextual reinstatement. It is fundamental to the neural dedifferentiation hypothesis that less differentiated representations be able to explain the marked age-related declines in higher-order functions, notably fluid intelligence, processing speed and – as examined in the present study – episodic memory (Li et al., 2001). Our results support this proposal, as do recent demonstrations of associations between neural category-specificity in older adults and fluid processing (Park et al., 2010), working memory load (Carp et al., 2010a), and episodic memory rather than perception (St-Laurent et al., 2014). In terms of brain–behavior relations, the present study also shows for the first time an association between an index of representation specificity and task performance which is age-dependent. This is consistent with the assumption of the dedifferentiation account that declines in specificity accounts of age-related cognitive change." "academic_press"
"209" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "The results of our psychopharmacological manipulation provide some support for the theory that a decline in dopamine transmission underpins age-related dedifferentiation (Li et al., 2001). In hippocampus, Sulpiride induced greater memory specificity in older adults whose memory was better at baseline (on Placebo) relative to those whose memory was poorer. The resulting brain–behavior association for the group as a whole on Sulpiride resembled that in the young on Placebo. Conversely, Bromocriptine induced a negative association of memory specificity and memory performance in the older group, boosting memory specificity in poorer relative to better performers (see Fig. 3). This partially supports our first prediction, and our prior findings (Morcom et al., 2010), indicating an association between dopaminergic-sensitivity of memory processing and individual memory ability in older adults only. However this association did not involve just a greater sensitivity in poorer performers, but a varying pattern of response according to baseline level of performance. While consistent with the dopamine hypothesis of aging, this does not fit the simple view that dopaminergic decline both reduces memory performance and increases dopamine sensitivity via a single mechanism. This result is considered in more detail below. The finding of an age- and individual performance-related dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal memory specificity, and the findings of Morcom et al. (2010), are also in line with recent behavioral genetics data which implicate individual differences in dopamine receptor and transporter genotypes in individual differences in episodic memory in later life (Li et al., 2013, Papenberg et al., 2013, Papenberg et al., 2014)." "academic_press"
"210" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "As noted in the Introduction, we previously found that encoding phase activity in the older group in MTL predicted later forgetting rather than remembering, and proposed that older adults may encode less distinctive memory representations which may not support specific recollection (Morcom et al., 2010). This is consistent with the current findings under Placebo. However, the dopaminergic effects in the present study suggest a need for modification of our previous account of the subsequent forgetting effects. This predicts that an intervention which enhances the subsequent forgetting effects would also tend to reduce memory specificity. However, Bromocriptine increased memory specificity in older adults with poorer memory at the same time as enhancing subsequent forgetting effects (see Fig. 3). The latter effects may instead reflect a form of “partial compensation”, which may improve subsequent memory specificity when it is engaged but may be engaged only when there has been some underlying loss of memory function (Daselaar and Cabeza, 2005, de Chastelaine et al., 2011, Morcom and Johnson, in press). This would be in keeping with the linear increase in memory performance in the older group with the increase in dopamine signaling, alongside the subsequent forgetting effects in the older group, i.e., association of activity in this region with unsuccessful encoding (although the behavioral effect did not vary reliably with individual differences in performance)." "academic_press"
"211" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "The dopaminergic modulation of distributed task-specific activity in the encoding phase was unexpected, with age-invariant increases under both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine. There were no accompanying behavioral effects on the phonological and semantic decisions, although the age-invariant Sulpiride effect on decision criterion in the memory task may reflect neuromodulatory mechanisms also affecting processing during one or both of the two orienting tasks. The task specificity measure was included as a baseline for the memory specificity measure, and likely reflected a range of linguistic, mnemonic and executive processes engaged in the two tasks. In pharmacological neuroimaging, nonspecific effects of drugs such as modulations of cerebral blood flow are a potential concern (Honey and Bullmore, 2004). These seem unlikely to account for highly process-specific effects such as those on memory specificity, but might contribute to the widespread effects on task specificity. Whatever the nature of the latter effect, the critical point for interpretation of the episodic memory findings is that the age-dependent dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus differed clearly from the age-invariant effects on task specificity. The performance-related drug effects in the older group only are consistent with the literature suggesting age-related changes in dopaminergic neuromodulation and reveal a greater general sensitivity to perturbations in dopamine signaling than in the young." "academic_press"
"212" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Our current and earlier investigations converge to support the possibility that age-related memory impairment is associated with an imbalance in hippocampal dopaminergic regulation. Older adults were more sensitive to dopaminergic perturbation than the young: D2-like blockade was associated with improved memory function (greater hippocampal memory specificity) in better older performers and D2-like stimulation with improved function in poorer performers. A hippocampal locus of this effect is consistent with associations of aging and age-related memory decline with loss of dopamine neurons and D2-like receptors in this region (Kaasinen et al., 2000) (Stemmelin et al., 2000). Dopamine regulates hippocampal function by modulation of its cortical inputs, directly via CA1 (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1998) and indirectly via entorhinal cortex (Pralong and Jones, 1993, Caruana, 2006). Thus the direction of effects may depend on cortical inputs as well as baseline function (Fujishiro et al., 2005, Umegaki et al., 2001). Behavioral and neuroimaging investigations in humans have found that D2-like modulation can enhance or impair cognitive function according to baseline function (e.g., Mehta et al., 2005, Mehta et al., 2008, Reeves et al., 2010), consistent with the literature on inverted U functions in PFC (see Cools and D'Esposito, 2011) and their alteration in aging (Mattay et al., 2006), as well as with the present data." "academic_press"
"213" "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.031" "Given the systemic dopaminergic manipulation, however, it is also possible that upstream effects – for example in striatum – can explain the MTL responses (Honey and Bullmore, 2004, Morcom et al., 2010). We found no evidence that the age-related differences in memory specificity in PFC were mediated by changes in dopaminergic transmission (Braver et al., 2001, Li et al., 2001). However, this null finding requires cautious interpretation. Future studies should investigate the possibility that the critical age changes mediating memory dedifferentiation in lateral PFC involve D1-like receptors which are numerous in this region (Bäckman et al., 2011). Whether or not cortical dopaminergic decline impacts on episodic memory, our findings in MTL are at least a marker of dopaminergic dysregulation, and hint that it may be possible to improve this regulation by adjusting dopamine signaling. Future studies are needed to establish the behavioral as well as the neural impact of such adjustments." "academic_press"
"218" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Major psychiatric disorders such as depression, psychosis and anxiety are associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, as reflected by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. interleukin-6, and acute phase proteins, e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), in peripheral blood during acute illness (Dickerson et al., 2016; Goldsmith et al., 2016; Howren et al., 2009; Maes, 1999; Upthegrove et al., 2014; Vogelzangs et al., 2013). Population-based longitudinal studies have shown that elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers during pregnancy or in childhood are associated with higher risk of developing symptoms of depression, psychosis and mania subsequently in adulthood (Canetta et al., 2014; Dalman et al., 2008; Hayes et al., 2017; Khandaker et al., 2014; Khandaker et al., 2012; Khandaker et al., 2013; Liang and Chikritzhs, 2012; Metcalf et al., 2017), suggesting that low-grade systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of major psychiatric disorders. Further evidence for a role of inflammation in psychiatric disorders comes from treatment studies. Meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate that anti-inflammatory drugs may have antidepressant effects. Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors given as adjuncts to antidepressants improve depressive symptoms in patients with depression (Köhler et al., 2014). Anti-cytokine drugs, which target inflammation more specifically, reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic inflammatory illness independently of improvements in physical illness (Kappelmann et al., 2016). However, evidence for the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment for psychotic disorders is less clear-cut. While some studies did not find an effect (Girgis et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2016; Nitta et al., 2013), adjunctive treatment with aspirin may be beneficial for psychosis (Sommer et al., 2013). Minocycline, a tetracyclic antibiotic, may improve negative symptoms and cognition in the early stages of schizophrenia (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Solmi et al., 2017)." "pergamon_press"
"219" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "It is likely that low-grade inflammation or anti-inflammatory drugs will be relevant for a subset of patients, because not all individuals with a major psychiatric disorder show evidence of inflammation. However, the prevalence of low-grade inflammation in patients with psychiatric disorders and clinical characteristics of patients who show evidence of inflammation is poorly understood. Previous studies have often compared concentrations of inflammatory markers between cases and non-cases, but there is limited data from clinical samples as to what proportion of patients with different psychiatric disorders show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation. The proportion of depressed patients with elevated CRP ranges from 19 to 47% according to previous studies, but studies based on acutely unwell inpatients are scarce (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Rethorst et al., 2014; Uher et al., 2014; Wysokiński et al., 2015). A large, population-based study from Denmark reported that about one third of patients with a history of hospitalisation for depression show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation, defined as a serum CRP level >3 mg/L (Wium-Andersen et al., 2013). However, data on the prevalence of inflammation in other patient groups is limited." "pergamon_press"
"220" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "A better understanding of psychiatric patients who present with evidence of inflammation is necessary because inflammation is thought to contribute to treatment resistance.

We compared psychiatric patients with and without low-grade systemic inflammation on a number of characteristics, including socio-demographic factors, primary diagnosis, prescribed medication, medical comorbidity, self-harm, alcohol misuse and length of admission. We repeated the analyses by defining inflammation using total white cell count (WBC) to check the robustness of associations observed using CRP." "pergamon_press"

All patients had been hospitalised to this mental health hospital for the treatment of a psychiatric disorder. Patient records were de-identified using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) for secondary research (Fernandes et al., 2013), and transferred into a research database with NHS and institutional approvals (UK NHS National Research Ethics Service reference 12/EE/0407). All patients who are admitted to CPFT acute hospitals are offered blood testing for CRP and WBC as per hospital protocol." "pergamon_press"

Exclusion criteria were: a) patients taking antibiotics (proxy for a current acute infection), b) patients on oral steroids. Patients on NSAIDs were not excluded as the presence of a chronic inflammatory condition is a key confounder and we wanted to be able to correct for it." "pergamon_press"
"224" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "For each patient, we extracted the following categorical information directly from the database: date of birth/age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, admission date, current ICD-10 diagnoses, and length of index admission. When a patient was admitted more than once in a six-month period, the first admission was used to avoid over-representation of patients with recurrent admissions (see also Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Data extracted from CRIS included diagnostic codes which could have been assigned to that patient at any time in the past according to the 10th Revision of the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Treating clinicians assigned the diagnoses, which were recorded by clinicians or administrative staff." "pergamon_press"
"225" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "A custom-built natural language processing software was used to extract numerical data relating to blood inflammatory markers. We extracted all available data relating to CRP and WBC. Only entries where CRP or WBC were recorded were kept for further analysis. The method for data extraction was accurate and reliable as measured by recall (probability of retrieving a record given it was relevant) and precision (probability of a record being relevant, given it was retrieved) statistics (see Supplementary Methods for procedure of calculating these statistics). Blood samples from patients admitted in Cambridge or Peterborough were tested in different labs, using assays with different sensitivity. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Heart Association guidelines CRP levels over 3 mg/L is considered to be high (Pearson et al., 2003; Ridker, 2003); such levels are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease (Koenig et al., 1999) and psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia (Metcalf et al., 2017) in population-based studies. For the purpose of this study, we have defined low-grade inflammation as a serum CRP level >3 mg/L. This is because the hospital laboratory only reported an exact value for CRP if it was equal or over 4 mg/L; levels below this threshold were reported as ≤3 mg/L (see Supplementary Methods for further details). Inflammation was coded as a binary variable: not inflamed (CRP ≤3 mg/L) or inflamed ( 3 mg/L). For analyses using total WBC, we selected a cut-off value of 9.4 × 109/L to define inflammation. This cut-off represents the third quartile of the distribution of WBC in our sample. This threshold is lower than the most common UK upper reference value for total WBC (11 × 109/L). Therefore, our approach captured subjects with low-grade inflammation rather than those with very high inflammation." "pergamon_press"

Medications were manually classified in drug classes (antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and sleep inducers, mood stabilisers, medication for medical comorbidities, NSAIDs and pain control medication, antibiotics – exclusion criterium, oral steroids – exclusion criterium). Antipsychotic medications were further divided into sub-classes (typical and atypical). Current prescriptions for an anti-hypertensive, diuretic, anti-diabetic, statin, anti-aggregant, anti-coagulant or medication for the management of dyslipidaemias were used as proxy for the presence of common, chronic medical illness. See the Supplementary Methods for further details about medication data coding." "pergamon_press"
"227" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Many patients had more than one recorded diagnosis. We used a hierarchical method to assign one “main diagnosis” per patient as follows: organic mental disorder > psychotic disorder > mood disorder > anxiety disorder > personality disorder > other psychiatric diagnosis. Presence of a diagnosis in an earlier category trumped diagnosis in subsequent categories, i.e., if a patient had recorded diagnoses of both a psychotic disorder and an anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder was chosen as main diagnosis." "pergamon_press"
"228" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "We calculated the prevalence of inflammation, defined as CRP >3 mg/L, for each major ICD-10 diagnostic group. We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) for the following factors: age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, main diagnosis, self-harm, alcohol abuse, medical comorbidities, current medications, length of admission. All predictors were coded as categorical variables. Age was converted to a categorical variable using the 25th, 50th and 75th centiles as cut-offs, which correspond to age 28, 39 and 49 years respectively. Length of admission was converted to binary as above or below median (13 days). The ORs were calculated using the following groups as reference: female sex, white British ethnicity, single status, age <28, “other” diagnosis, “short” admission (<13 days).

We tested the association between CRP (binary variable) and total WBC (continuous variable) using logistic regression; high CRP (>3 mg/L) was the dependent variable, and WBC was the independent variable. All statistical analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2017). Plots were made using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009), using the Cairo R graphics device (Urbanek and Horner, 2005)." "pergamon_press"

There were no differences in sex, ethnicity, or age distribution between patients who had available blood results (analytic sample), and those who didn’t, however the analytic sample was relatively impoverished in married patients (see Supplementary Table 1). For CRP data, recall was 1.0 and precision was 0.96 indicating that the method for data extraction was accurate and reliable. For WBC data, recall was 0.76 and precision was 1.0.

A number of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with inflammation. Older age and current treatment with antidepressants and benzodiazepines were associated with an increased risk of inflammation after controlling for potential confounders. These findings were consistent across analyses using CRP and WBC as markers of inflammation. Being married appeared to be protective against inflammation, but evidence for this association did not persist after excluding patients with CRP >20 mg/L. There was some evidence that inflammation was associated with current/past self-harm and with being on treatment for medical comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia.

"256" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "There could be many reasons for a high prevalence of low-grade inflammation in acutely unwell psychiatric patients. Psychological stress can activate the immune system (Padgett and Glaser, 2003). Exposure to early-life adversity, common in psychiatric patients, can increase levels of inflammation in adulthood (Baumeister et al., 2016). Inflammation could be a marker of co-morbid inflammatory physical illness. However, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation could be an intrinsic part of psychiatric illnesses. Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies show increased levels of inflammatory markers in acutely unwell patients with depression and psychosis (Howren et al., 2009; Potvin et al., 2008). Population-based longitudinal studies have reported that higher levels of IL-6 and CRP are associated with symptoms/diagnosis of depression, mania and psychosis subsequently in life (Gimeno et al., 2009; Hayes et al., 2017; Khandaker et al., 2014; Khandaker et al., 2017; Metcalf et al., 2017; Zalli et al., 2016), suggesting low-grade inflammation could be a cause for these illnesses, rather than simply being a consequence."

"257" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Our results are in line with previous studies reporting prevalence of low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) in depression (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Wium-Andersen et al., 2013). These studies have investigated inflammation in depression in specific contexts such as in premenopausal women, in depressed outpatients, or in the general population. Our study adds to previous findings by reporting the prevalence of inflammation a) in a psychiatric inpatient population, and b) in other patient groups." "pergamon_press"
"258" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "A previous study examined the prevalence of inflammation in the general population, and found that, using reference limits set at the time of the analysis, for WBC 21.4% of the population had an above-reference value, and for CRP 22.2% of the population had above-reference results (Andersen et al., 2014). However, it should be noted that cut-offs for WBC/CRP levels used to define low-grade inflammation in our study were different, as we were interested in low-grade inflammation." "pergamon_press"
"259" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Associations of inflammation with older age, marital status and ethnic minority status are consistent with previous studies (Khera et al., 2005; Sbarra, 2009; Wener et al., 2000; Woloshin and Schwartz, 2005), although we have not seen any association with sex. In our sample, current treatments with antidepressants, anxiolytics/hypnotics were robustly associated with inflammation. This is consistent with previous studies reporting elevated levels of inflammatory markers in patients with depression (Dowlati et al., 2010; Goldsmith et al., 2016; Haapakoski et al., 2015; Howren et al., 2009). Furthermore, raised levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression and psychosis in young adulthood (Khandaker et al., 2014), and persistent depressive symptoms during the second decade of life (Khandaker et al., 2017). However, a diagnosis of depression was associated with lower risk of inflammation, which is surprising. It is possible that antidepressant prescription is a better proxy for current depression in our sample; data on diagnoses obtained from electronic health records were historical, while prescription data refers to the current admission. Nevertheless, there was some evidence that high WBC was associated with a diagnosis of depression although this was not statistically significant. We did not have repeat measures of CRP/WBC at the end of the admission, so it was not possible to examine the association of inflammation with treatment response." "pergamon_press"
"260" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Association of inflammation with self-harm and medical comorbidities are consistent with previous studies. Previous studies have reported an association between inflammation and suicidal ideation/behaviour (Gibbs et al., 2016; Park and Kim, 2017). Self-harm and suicidal ideas are markers of psychiatric multi-morbidity (Hui et al., 2013), so reflect patients with greater psychological distress. Previous studies have reported that inflammatory markers are associated with the severity of depressive symptoms (Köhler-Forsberg et al., 2017) and with persistent depressive symptoms (Khandaker et al., 2017; Zalli et al., 2016). Both cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are associated with low-grade inflammation (Koenig et al., 1999; Pearson et al., 2003). There is evidence of insufficient glucocorticoid signalling and elevated inflammation in coronary heart disease patients with comorbid depression (Nikkheslat et al., 2015).

"261" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "A decreased risk of inflammation in patients taking mood stabilisers is consistent with known anti-inflammatory effects of lithium (Kucharz et al., 1993; Sluzewska et al., 1997) and valproate (Yuen et al., 2010). CRP levels increase during a manic phase, which is at least partially reversed by treatment with mood stabilisers (Fernandes et al., 2016). Our finding is also consistent with a previous longitudinal study reporting an association between childhood IL-6 levels and lifetime hypomanic symptoms assessed in adulthood (Hayes et al., 2017). Interestingly, inflammation was not associated with the prescription of NSAIDs, which was used as a proxy for chronic inflammatory illness. This suggests that the inflammation seen in psychiatric patients in our sample might not be driven solely by co-morbid inflammatory medical conditions, but it could rather be inherent to their psychiatric illness."

The results are consistent with recent evidence showing there is an increase in peripheral inflammatory markers in schizophrenia, which normalised with antipsychotic treatment. IL-1β, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are schizophrenia state markers, as they increase in acute relapses and first episode psychosis and normalize with antipsychotic treatment (Miller et al., 2011). In contrast, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and soluble IL-2 receptor are trait markers, as levels remain elevated in acute exacerbations and following antipsychotic treatment. Furthermore, IL-6 levels correlate positively with symptom severity (Miller et al., 2011).

"263" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "The limitations of this study need to be considered carefully. This study is based on retrospective analysis of data from an electronic health record that was not created for the purpose of research. Although the work demonstrates that routine clinical databases can be used to address important research questions, there are limitations to using routine clinical data. Missing data is a key issue. Although all patients admitted to CPFT inpatient hospitals are offered a physical examination including a blood test (which includes WBC and CRP routinely), only a subset of all potentially eligible patients had data on inflammatory markers. Approximately 41% of the admissions that we considered (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) had recorded blood results within 14 days of admission. The remaining 59% who did not have blood results recorded within 2 weeks of admission were not included in our study; these patients might have refused venepuncture at the time of admission or had bloods taken after 14 days of coming into hospital, which we excluded from our study to minimize potential effects of hospital treatment. CRP and WBC data recall and precision also affected the probability of inclusion into the analytic sample, as described in the methods. While the possibility of selection bias due to missing data cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely that blood tests were offered primarily because of a suspected physical illness. Therefore, the increased prevalence of inflammation in psychiatric patients is unlikely to be due to a physical illness. Data on diagnosis were also missing for many patients. We included only patients with a clinician-coded ICD-10 diagnosis to increase accuracy. Therefore, diagnosis data are more specific than sensitive. However, patients often more than one psychiatric diagnosis, so we used a hierarchical approach to assign a single main diagnosis to each patient. This hierarchical approach has been used previously in psychiatric research (Foulds and Bedford, 1975). It is possible that for some patients the reason for admission was different from their main diagnosis, leading to misclassification of diagnosis. However, this is unlikely to be an issue for a majority of patients." "pergamon_press"
"264" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "To explore potential selection bias due to missing data, we compared demographic factors between the analytic sample and missing sample (all unique patients meeting all selection criteria but with no recorded CRP on admission). These samples were similar in terms of sociodemographic factors except for marital status, suggesting that, while the possibility of selection bias cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely to be a major issue (see Supplementary Table 1). However, the prevalence of inflammation in patients with depression observed in our sample is comparable to previous studies of depression (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Wium-Andersen et al., 2013): this is reassuring. The database would not differentiate between first and subsequent admissions for a specific patient for a given diagnosis, therefore we were unable to compare recent onset cases with those with chronic illness."

"266" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "Our study is limited to patients who were admitted to hospital. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine the prevalence of inflammation in psychiatric inpatients from all major ICD-10 diagnostic groups. However, the decision to admit is often guided by clinical risk perceived by clinicians, so the findings may not be generalizable to all patients. We did not have readily available data on BMI, smoking or recreational drug use. Therefore, the association between inflammation and diagnosis of psychosis might reflect antipsychotic induced obesity/metabolic disturbance. Due to the lack of an electronic prescribing system, we used a natural language processing software to extract names of prescribed drugs from medical notes. This system has been previously validated in a similar study (Cardinal et al., 2015). However, while we were able to ascertain whether a particular drug was prescribed or not, we could not ascertain specific indication for that prescription. The same psychotropic drugs can be prescribed for many disorders. Therefore, the relationship between prescribed antidepressant and inflammation might reflect that inflammation is associated with a range of disorders for which these drugs are prescribed, rather than depression specifically." "pergamon_press"
"267" "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.031" "In summary, our findings indicate that a large minority of acutely unwell psychiatric patients show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation, regardless of their diagnosis. Low-grade inflammation is associated with a number of socio-demographic and clinical factors, which may help to characterise an inflammatory sub-type of the major psychiatric disorders. For conditions such as depression, it is known that an inflammatory phenotype is associated with treatment resistance. This is not known for all other psychiatric disorders. Characterising the inflammatory sub-type of psychiatric disorders could therefore allow to predict which patients might be treatment resistant, and incentivises work into elucidating the clinical phenotype of inflamed patients presenting with other psychiatric conditions."

"276" "10.1002/JLB.3A0617-261R" "One plausible sequence of events is that peripheral proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6, induced the expression of enzymes involved in tryptophan catabolism, for example, indoleamine dioxygenase, kynurenine hydroxylase, and kynureninase,10 thereby reducing the availability of synaptic serotonin11, 12, 13; which is a proximal cause of depressive symptoms.14 Inflammation‐induced changes in tryptophan metabolism can also lead to increased synthesis of kynurenine and its metabolites, many of which are known to be glutamatergic agonists and/or neurotoxic.15 Thus, inflammation could produce the “double hit” both reducing the availability of serotonin and increasing production of kynurenine." "john_wiley_and_sons_inc."
"277" "10.1002/JLB.3A0617-261R" "The same mechanisms may explain the clinical observation that patients with depressive symptoms in the context of peripheral inflammation (“inflamed depression”) are less responsive to monoaminergic antidepressant drugs, so called “treatment‐resistant depression.”16 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for example, are thought to increase the synaptic availability of serotonin (by blocking active uptake by presynaptic neurons expressing the serotonin transporter protein (SERT/SLC6A4)).17 If synaptic serotonin is reduced by an inflammatory response, and SSRIs are not anti‐inflammatory,18 SSRIs are likely to be less effective in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus. Additionally, the neurotoxic effects of kynurenine and its metabolites, which are exacerbated by inflammation, are mediated by glutamatergic‐related mechanisms that are not modulated by monoaminergic antidepressants. Treatment‐resistant depression—due to reduced serotonin availability and increased neurotoxicity by non‐serotonergic mechanisms—is thus predictable in the context of peripheral inflammation.12, 13, 19, 20

Macrophages are both initiators and mediators of inflammation‐associated pathology21 and have long been implicated in inflammation induced depression,20 largely based on the inflammatory induced activation of tryptophan depletion pathways.10, 19, 20 Microglia, the macrophages of the brain,22 play a crucial role in neuronal homeostasis, and the impairments in neuronal function associated with many clinical disorders, including major depression.23 Unlike human macrophages, mouse macrophages do not induce tryptophan uptake or enzymes associated with tryptophan metabolism in response to proinflammatory signals,24 making them a poor model for such studies. In the current study, we have used human MDMs, differentiated by CSF1, to study the impacts of 2 antidepressant drugs and 3 anti‐inflammatory drugs on the transcriptional response to 2 proinflammatory challenges: LPS and IFNα. In addition to acting as a primary human cell model for microglia, these cells are also used to examine tryptophan depletion mechanisms during peripheral inflammation, and how drugs may influence this effect."

"280" "10.1002/JLB.3A0617-261R" "Three classes of anti‐inflammatory drugs were selected to examine their effects on both inflammatory stimuli: a neutralizing antibody for the inflammatory cytokine TNFα; a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (indomethacin); and a steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (prednisolone). Neutralizing anti‐TNFα antibodies act by binding to TNFα in circulation, thus blocking its proinflammatory effects mediated by action at TNF receptors.29 TNFα acts in an autocrine manner on stimulated macrophages to induce downstream targets and amplify the initial induction of proinflammatory target genes.27, 30 Indomethacin acts by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) or prostaglandin synthase enzymes (COX1/COX2; PTGS1/PTGS2).31 The anti‐inflammatory activity of COX inhibitors is thought to depend on preventing inducible prostaglandin production, which can also act in an autocrine manner in macrophages through inducible prostaglandin receptors.25 Both COX‐inhibiting and TNFα‐inhibiting drugs have been shown to have some antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in patients with psychologic symptoms in the context of medical inflammatory disorders.32 Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone, are amongst the most commonly prescribed anti‐inflammatory agents, and act by inducing multiple feedback repressors of inflammation, including IκB and DUSP1.33 The responses to glucocorticoids also differ radically between humans and mice, due to the gain and loss of glucocorticoid response elements in enhancers,33 so there is a clear need to study their effects in humans systems. The glucocorticoid ligand/receptor complex may also directly repress signaling by interfering with the activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NF‐κB34 leading to a genome wide blockade of NF‐κB interactions with chromatin.35

SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed drugs for treating depression and their efficacy depends at least partly on increasing synaptic availability of serotonin (5‐HT). However, 5‐HT also plays an important role in immune signaling,36 and SSRIs have been shown to enhance the cytolytic function of NK cells, to enhance B cell numbers, and to inhibit 5‐HT uptake and immune signaling by dendritic cells,37 suggesting that immune mechanisms might also contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. The TCAs are less selectively serotonergic, and also block multiple classes of receptors for acetylcholine, histamine and noradrenaline. The use of TCAs in the treatment of the residual symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease,38 suggests they may have some efficacy as anti‐inflammatory agents.39 Supplemental Fig. S1 illustrates the known mode of action of each drug examined here."

LPS is itself known to induce type 1 IFNs (mainly IFNβ) in MDM, which act in an autocrine manner via IFNAR1, itself induced by LPS.27 Accordingly, the response to exogenous type 1 IFN (IFNα) was largely a subset of the LPS response, as reported in previous studies.24, 28, 50, 51, 54 None of the anti‐inflammatory agents we examined completely prevented the response to either challenge and, although prednisolone and anti‐TNFα both reduced expression of many genes that were up‐ or down‐regulated by the inflammatory challenges, each had a distinctive transcriptional effect.

This is likely due to the transient induction of feed‐forward and negative feedback loops of TNFα transcription following inflammatory stimulus. Like IFNα, TNFα was predicted to be involved in an autocrine loop in MDM elicited by LPS, since the TNFα receptor is also induced.27 Our data (Supplemental Table S2) confirm and extend evidence of autocrine TNFα signaling as a feed‐forward activator of macrophage gene expression30, 62, 63 and identify the subset of inducible genes dependent upon that stimulus. The lack of impact of anti‐TNFα on LPS‐inducible IDO1 may reflect the magnitude of the response. Alternatively, activation of IDO1 by IFN‐γ requires co‐stimulation by TNFα, which increases the occupancy of IFN‐response elements.64, 65 It may be that LPS provides this second signal independently of TNFα.30, 62, 63

However, although anti‐TNFα and prednisolone each significantly reduced IDO1 activity at 24 h post‐IFNα stimulation, indomethacin treatment did not. Indomethacin did, however, significantly reduce transcription of tryptophan transporters induced by both inflammatory challenges, potentially reducing the availability of intracellular tryptophan as a substrate for IDO1.

This is in contrast to reports that TCAs reduce proinflammatory signaling in phagocytes,68 and SSRIs have been reported to alter macrophage differentiation and inflammatory signaling.67, 69 SSRIs have also been reported to modulate glucocorticoid actions on monocytes.70 Although we found no direct effect of SSRIs or TCAs on macrophage responses to either LPS or IFNα, we did observe significant cytotoxicity at concentrations that were <20‐fold lower than circulating blood concentrations in treated patients. In support of this, nortriptyline has previously been shown to induce autophagy in macrophages.39 Indeed, many antidepressants are cationic amphipaths, and are therefore lysosomotropic71 likely accumulating selectively in phagocytic cells.

Nortriptyline acts by blocking the histamine, cholinergic, muscarinic and β2‐adrenergic receptors and is believed to primarily block noradrenaline signaling, which results in less 5HT uptake. This results in a relative increase of 5‐HT available in the brain, thus improving mood. Inflammatory stimuli used in the assay, LPS and IFNα, are depicted at the bottom of the diagram. IFNα is recognised by its receptor inducing an inflammatory response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. LPS is detected through the TLR4 complex and induces a powerful inflammatory response, which also involves production of TNFα and IFNβ which contribute to the overall response to LPS. Prednisolone (upper right) forms a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor and translocates to the nucleus. From here, the receptor ligand complex is known to up‐regulate anti‐inflammatory gene expression. In addition, it prevents inflammatory gene transcription via the NF‐κB transcription factor, RelA, in response to inflammatory stimuli such LPS or IFNα. TNFα is a powerful inflammatory cytokine, which is involved in autocrine signaling during inflammation, further driving the response. Anti‐TNFα antibodies (lower left) neutralise TNFα, preventing autocrine signaling and reducing further transcription of inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory response also up‐regulates prostaglandin synthases which further increase inflammation.

We used spline models to quantify the nonlinear path of grey matter development at each of 53 neocortical areas defined by an anatomical template, and 16 major allocortical and subcortical structures, in each of 41 animals aged between 3 and 27 months. Each animal was scanned at least twice in an accelerated longitudinal design allowing us to model developmental changes from before puberty to early adulthood. We predicted that association cortex and subcortical nuclei would show a protracted time course of grey matter development compared with that of primary and secondary sensory and motor areas. Further, given that varied changes in prefrontal function and structure are associated with nearly all neuropsychiatric conditions, we hypothesized that prefrontal cortex may comprise a particularly heterogeneous collection of growth curves with distinctive developmental profiles."

In designing a study of this type, there must be a trade off between focussing heavily on particular individuals or scanning widely across a population. The longitudinal assessment of individuals is crucial for unmasking details of the developmental trajectories. However, by including data from many individuals we have been able to additionally capture the variability in the population more widely. In this way, our design captures trajectory details that are more likely to generalize to the population. Images were obtained from 3 to 27 months at quarterly intervals.

Milestones were estimated using the first derivative of the spline grey matter volume change in each region. At the peak, the first derivative is zero. By bootstrap resampling, 95% confidence intervals were obtained for the age at which the derivative was not zero. The age of onset of decline was defined as the upper limit of that interval.

Areas of volume growth and reduction are shown with different color scales. In each map, relative volume reductions are virtually all in grey matter regions, with corresponding increases in white matter regions. Prepuberty, GM changes are particularly striking in the frontal cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, and medial aspects of primary visual cortex. During this stage of development, major white matter tracts change substantially, most clearly in the anterior commissure, at the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus.

It may be that more subtle findings could exist and be detected with a larger cohort at all age points. It is not straightforward to sex marmosets at 3 months and unfortunately we had only 4 of 17 female marmosets at this age. Looking specifically at 12 months, however, in a comparison of 12 female versus 19 male animals there were no significant volume differences seen with TBM.

For illustrative purposes, the fitted curves of the splines and their derivatives are shown for a primary sensory area, V1, and a higher association area, 13, in prefrontal cortex. A complete set of trajectories for every brain region is provided in Supplementary Material. Brain maps of these key developmental milestones highlight marked differences within cortical lobes as well as between cortical and subcortical regions (Fig. 6). The initial peak volume (I) for all cortical structures is just prior to, or during the early stages of puberty (5–7 months). This feature discriminates between primary and association cortex, particularly within visual cortex, with V1 peaking first (month 5), and a trend to later peaks for V3, V4, and V5 (month 6), but not so for V6 (month 5.4), consistent with the view that this area is distinct from V3 (Angelucci and Rosa 2015). Primary motor and somatosensory cortices peak shortly after V1, months 6.0 and 5.9, respectively, whilst primary auditory cortex is somewhat delayed: reaching its peak along with the auditory belt and parabelt regions at month 6.4.

The maximum rate of change following the growth peak defines stage III). These features can be seen most clearly in the first derivative curves, which display the rate of change of volume as a function of age. The first difference of note in the growth trajectories is the time at which each region reaches its greatest volume (milestone I); 4.98 months for V1 and 6 months for area 13. In V1, there is only a short period of approximately 1 month, before the onset of volume decline at 6 months (milestone II). In contrast, the peak volume of area 13 remains unchanged for approximately 6 months before starting to decline at 12 months. 3D reconstructions show the age at which these features occur for each cortical and subcortical region."

In contrast, the majority of the prefrontal cortex, including orbitofrontal and perigenual cingulate cortex (area 32), and much of the anterior temporal lobes, start to decline much later, around 12–14 months, after puberty has finished. There are noticeable exceptions though. Cingulate association regions including subgenual area 25, dorsal anterior area 24 and posterior area 23 have an onset of volume decline much earlier (months 6–6.5), closer to that seen in posterior sensory cortices and motor cortex."

"376" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "The division between cortical brain regions in the age at which they display the maximum rate of decline in volume (III) varies considerably from the divisions seen in the age of the onset of decline (II). Consistent with the latter is the relatively early age, before or at the beginning of puberty (7.9–8.5 months), that parietal and occipital regions display their fastest rate of decline compared with that of prefronto-temporal areas at the end of puberty and sexual maturity (14–20.7 months). However, other brain regions that exhibited a relatively early age of onset of volume decline including primary and secondary somatosensory (S2) and premotor (area 6)/motor (area 4) regions (6.6–7.4 months) showed their fastest rate of decline much later (15.9–22 months) like that of prefronto-temporal areas. This was also the case for area 25 which showed one of the earliest onsets of decline at 6.0 months but one of the latest time-points for maximum decline (19.8 months), alongside area 32 (19.4 months), secondary somatosensory (22 months), and the ventral temporal lobes (20.8 months).

However, this is not the case for the anterior hypothalamus, basolateral and central amygdala, basal nucleus of the stria terminalis, habenula, dorsal and medial raphe nucleus that peak much later, between 10 and 16 months. Of those that peak early, only Acb, DLCaud, VLCaud, Lseptum, and MD Thal also show an early onset of decline (6.5–8.0 months).

Of note was the marked difference in the onset of decline between striatal regions, with Acb, DLCaud and VLCaud declining at 6.5–7.8 months compared with the Put and Caud declining between 12.8 and 13.4 months.

By comparing pairs of milestones in relation to these clusters (2D plots in Fig. 7B) a bimodal split in the age of onset and maximum rate of decline can be clearly seen. For the visual and cingulate cluster (1), somatomotor cluster (2), and auditory–visual cluster (3) onset of decline occurs at, or before the onset of puberty, soon after the point of peak volume. In contrast, onset of decline occurs at a much later timepoint after the point of peak volume, post puberty, for the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventromedial prefrontal cluster (4), ventrolateral PFC, polar, operculum, and insula cluster (5) and the lateral and inferior temporal lobe cluster (6). In addition, in the 2 clusters (4 and 5) involving prefrontal cortex, there appear to be 2 phases to the decline, an early shallow volume decline followed by a later more pronounced volume decline (maximum rate of volume decline)."

"383" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Detailed analysis of growth trajectories across 69 cortical and subcortical regions in marmosets from 3 to 27 months, using an accelerated longitudinal design, revealed 3 major features of grey matter development. These milestones of development were age at peak volume, onset of volume decline, and maximum rate of volume decline. Comparison of the resulting age maps showed that whilst cortical regions differed in the timing of peak volume by just 3 months (months 5–7), the period in which the volume began to decline was much more protracted, ranging from 6 to 14 months, with the maximum rate of decline occurring between 10 and 20 months. These feature-specific age maps revealed unique differences in trajectories within and between cortical and subcortical regions that varied between features. The prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of all the association regions with multiple areas displaying distinct milestones and developmental trajectories." "oxford_university_press"
"384" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "To date, developmental neuroimaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates have revealed a number of key features of cortical development. There is considerable cerebral growth from infancy to adolescence, being greatest in humans and chimpanzees (both ~30%), but considerably lower in macaques (11%) (Sakai et al. 2013) and marmosets, as seen here (7%). Although GM increases before puberty are not consistently reported in humans (Walhovd et al. 2017), there is broad agreement that GM declines during development, whereas WM increases throughout infancy and puberty and post pubertal adolescence. This has been shown in humans (Giedd et al. 1996; Gogtay et al. 2004; Shaw et al. 2008) and more recently marmosets (Seki et al. 2017); and, in both species, differences in the timing of peak GM volume and rate of decline distinguish cortical brain regions. This overall pattern is also seen in the present study. In contrast, the decline in GM has not been seen so clearly in studies of the macaque monkey. In the 2 studies that followed development across a long enough developmental time period, one study (Scott et al. 2016) did not distinguish between grey and white matter and so the continuing rise in volume that they reported most likely reflects the continuing rise in white matter that has been reported in other studies. In the other study (Knickmeyer et al. 2010) only a rise and subsequent decline was seen in the prefrontal region. All other cortical regions showed either a continuing rise or no change. As that study was purely cross-sectional, it is likely that individual variability masked details of the developmental trajectory exposed in a longitudinal design. Individual variability can be substantial (compare panels A and B of Fig. 2 to see the effect of allowing for individual variability in elucidating growth trajectories)." "oxford_university_press"
"385" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "In studies of macaques and previous studies of marmosets there was relatively gross parcellation of the cortex, primarily at the level of cortical lobes (e.g., parietal, occipital). In contrast, in humans, when a more detailed analysis is performed at the level of specific cortical regions, substantially different developmental trajectories have been identified that differentiate isocortex (complex cubic trajectory) from older allocortex (linear or quadratic trajectories) (Shaw et al. 2008)." "oxford_university_press"
"386" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "The current results provide important new insight by characterizing 2 additional features of the developmental growth trajectories that, combined with an even finer-grained analysis at the level of individual cytoarchitectonic divisions, have revealed a more complex array of developmental time windows. Hence, they provide greater differentiation of primate cortical growth patterns than hitherto described. Importantly, they not only replicate previous findings that the frontal and temporal cortices develop later than all other cortical regions but they reveal that the variability in the timing of development within prefrontal cortex is the most heterogeneous of all cortical regions." "oxford_university_press"
"387" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "The first of these features is the plateau length. The second is the age at which the maximum rate of decline occurs. Previous modeling of cortical growth curves has not had sufficient degrees of freedom to capture these additional features. Together with maximum volume, these 3 developmental milestones reflected in the growth trajectories of the GM most likely represent distinct ages at which numerous different physiological/cellular processes are occurring. The increase and decline (inverted “U” shape) in structural volume measurements is a direct consequence of not only brain shape and localized volume changes, but changes of the MRI signal itself. This can occur because of changes in the fraction of watery “cytoplasmic material,” like cell bodies, synapses or extracellular fluid. Thus, the early increases in GM volume reported here likely reflect the critical periods of experience dependent molding of cortical columnar architecture in monkeys including macaques and marmosets (Alexander and Goldman 1978; Missler et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 1995; Shaw et al. 2008; Geschwind and Rakic 2013; Takesian and Hensch 2013), which may close around the time of peak volume. The subsequent decline in GM volume may be the result of a period of pruning and the selective elimination of synapses (Anderson et al. 1995). However, an additional contributor to a decline in the MRI signal is an increase in the fraction of “fatty” myelinated material, like axons. Consequently, the apparent shrinkage of GM may also represent the expansion of myelinated axons into the cortical neuropil (Shaw et al. 2008; Whitaker et al. 2016). Each of the 3 milestones may therefore provide insight into differential cortical organization, pruning and myelination during development." "oxford_university_press"
"388" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Of the 3 milestones, the “age of peak volume” showed the smallest difference across all the cortical regions. The occipital pole was first, at approximately 5 months, and then the age increased incrementally from caudal to rostral, with the latest timing of peak volume occurring in the frontal pole and anterior temporal cortex and pole at 7.8 months. Thus, if this represents the period of experience dependent molding of cortical columnar architecture this appears to occur at a relatively similar time period across the cortex. The exceptions were in some subcortical regions including the hypothalamus, BNST, amygdala, habenula, caudate body, and raphe. Cortical regions displayed a much greater difference in the age of onset of GM decline, the age of the maximum rate of decline and the duration of that period of decline, periods likely associated with pruning and myelination. The “age of onset of the decline in volume” highlighted the late maturation (12–14 months) post puberty of the prefrontal and lateral and inferior temporal association cortices, compared with the rest of the cortex, in which onset of decline occurred at or before puberty. Of note, the association areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, including dorsal area 24 and subgenual area 25, showed a much earlier onset of decline, between 6 and 8 months, similar to primary and secondary sensory regions, suggesting that pruning and myelination processing may be engaged in these regions much earlier than neighboring prefrontal association cortex. However, the age of “maximum rate of decline,” suggestive of a period of maximal neuronal pruning/myelination, occurs very late in area 25 (19.8 m) in late adolescence, more similar in time to that of prefrontal association cortex. Indeed, this milestone is only later still in the ventral temporal lobe (20.8 m) and secondary somatosensory cortex (22 m), areas that are interconnected with area 25 (Joyce and Barbas 2018). Whilst only a small number of studies have investigated marmoset brain development in post mortem tissue and these have been limited to just a few specific cortical brain areas, there is re-assuring correspondence in the timings of periods of greatest circuitry rearrangement in those brain regions and the timing of MRI milestones described here. For example, the relatively flat MRI-derived growth trajectory of V1 after 9 months is consistent with the completion of the period of greatest circuitry rearrangement in V1 reported by (Fritschy and Garey 1986) and (Spatz et al. 1993). Also, the finding that middle temporal area and primary visual areas have similar growth trajectories and milestones is comparable to that revealed by neurofilament protein immunostaining; a marker of morphological maturation of neurons and stability of connections (Bourne and Rosa 2006). Finally, the same marker has been used to show later maturation of rostral regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with caudal regions (Burman et al. 2007), supported by the delayed age of onset of decline in grey matter of area 46 compared with area 8 described here (compare purple and orange trajectories in Fig. 7C)." "oxford_university_press"
"389" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Additional insights into the general principles of cortical brain growth are provided by the cluster analysis of the overall developmental trajectories. Whilst we highlight the 6 cluster solution in particular, it is interesting to note that higher cluster solutions of 7–10 display a hierarchical reorganization (Fig. 8) and in all cases involve further fractionation of the prefrontal cortex involving the ventrolateral PFC (areas 45, 47) and the frontal pole (area 10) (from 6 to 7 clusters), areas 25 and 32 (from 7 to 8 clusters), area 10 (from 8 to 9 clusters), and finally areas 8 and 24 and area 13 (from 9 to 10 clusters). This indicates that not only does the prefrontal cortex, along with anterotemporal regions of association cortex, display the latest maturation but the prefrontal cortex also shows the greatest variability in developmental growth patterns. It should be noted that we do not suggest that k = 6 is an important biological conclusion of itself, but we have used the clustering solutions to demonstrate that our 3 chosen milestones usefully distinguish between families of trajectories chosen by a data-driven technique that does not rely on manual selection of features of interest." "oxford_university_press"
"390" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Of the differing cortical growth patterns identified in the current study a few deserve highlighting because of their particular novelty and relevance to symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders and susceptibility to stress during development. The rapid onset of decline in the cingulate cortex occurring at approximately the same time as that of the occipital lobe suggests that maturational processes start early throughout this region. However, unlike the occipital and dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, the maturational processes in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, primarily area 25, extend over the entire pubertal and postpubertal periods. This may indicate that the subgenual cingulate cortex is particularly vulnerable to external stressors for extended periods of development and may explain its prominent role in models of depression (Drevets et al. 2008; Johansen-Berg et al. 2008). Other areas showing an overall similar growth trajectory to subgenual area 25 include the more anterior ventromedial areas 14 and 32, medial orbital regions 11 and 13, areas 9 and 46 and secondary somatosensory association cortex, regions with which area 25 is directly connected (Joyce and Barbas 2018). In addition, this trajectory pattern best described those of the ventromedial caudate, accumbens, basolateral amygdala, mediodorsal thalamus, and medial raphe area, all regions with extensive connectivity with medial orbital and ventromedial regions of PFC and involved in the regulation of emotion (Price and Drevets 2012; Joyce and Barbas 2018)." "oxford_university_press"
"391" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "The other cluster within k = 6 clusters to involve prefrontal regions included frontal polar area 10, and ventrolateral PFC regions 45 and 47, alongside the full extent of the insula cortex and neighboring proisocortex in the temporal pole. The inclusion of the auditory parabelt region is consistent with the known connections of this region with vocalization processing within ventrolateral PFC regions in macaques (Plakke and Romanski 2014). Moreover, vocalizations induced by periaqueductal grey stimulation activate the vlPFC region in other new world monkeys, for example, tamarinds (Jurgens et al. 1996). These findings concur with those of (Raznahan et al. 2011), which, by studying the default mode and task positive networks in humans, provided evidence for close associations between functional and maturational coupling." "oxford_university_press"
"392" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Together the findings presented here, in particular the heterogeneity of developmental trajectories within the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, provides important new insight into the distinct stages of development at which these different prefrontal/cingulate circuits, and hence different cognitive and emotional functions, may be at their most vulnerable to stress-related psychological, physiological and immunological impact. This will guide future developmental stress models of psychiatric disorders, highlighting different windows of sensitivity for targeting stressful interventions. Such models have the potential to reveal distinct behavioral phenotypes arising from these different developmental epochs that may cause a specific spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, knowledge of the timing of milestones in distinct brain regions will guide not only future post mortem studies but also further imaging studies targeting these relevant developmental epochs to characterize the underlying cellular processes that these milestones represent."

"393" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "In recently published marmoset studies (Seki et al. 2017; Uematsu et al. 2017) the MRI is at a lower spatial resolution than the present study and importantly a biexponential model (i.e., V=Aeαt−Beβt, for the volume V of a brain region at age t) is fitted to the data after removing subject effects, in contrast to the cubic spline approach used here. The biexponential growth model can only support a single turning point (at age t=1β−αln(αA/βB)) with all brain structures showing rapid initial postnatal volume growth with relative stability in adulthood. The constraint of a single turning point restricts flexibility in the crucial stages between infancy and adolescence (which are also where many neuropsychiatric problems become apparent). Thus, this model is unable to capture the additional features that we have shown clearly differentiate growth patterns of primary and association areas of cortex. Other studies in the marmoset have a more limited scope, for example, focussing exclusively on corpus callosum measurements (Sakai et al. 2017) or gross cortical divisions (Seki et al. 2017)." "oxford_university_press"
"394" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Similarly, the low-order polynomial models typically adopted in human studies (Shaw et al. 2008), such as linear, quadratic, and cubic curves, which allow 0, 1, or 2 turning points respectively, also do not allow as much flexibility to match features in growth curves as afforded by cubic splines. In addition, the parameters from such models can be highly variable depending on seemingly irrelevant factors such as the range in ages of the included subjects (Fjell et al. 2010) and by their nature have inappropriate limiting behavior for very young and very old subjects. Although polynomial models may serve as suitable interpolants over limited age ranges, they are incapable of accurately modeling more complicated features such as the rapid initial growth followed by a delayed onset of decline prior to the relative stability seen in adulthood that our data show." "oxford_university_press"
"395" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Two processes are responsible for GM volume reductions reported here. Proton density in myelinated tissue is approximately 10% lower and bound protons in myelin layers have a shortened T2, leading to lower signal intensity in the present MRI protocol (Tofts 2003). As the volume fraction of myelin increases, the signal becomes hypointense and such tissues are given a greater WM weighting and a lesser GM weighting in the segmentation process." "oxford_university_press"
"396" "10.1093/cercor/bhy256" "Other processes can cause signal reductions that could increase the likelihood that voxels are labeled as WM, such as iron deposition or reduction in water content. A more sophisticated imaging protocol, for example multiparametric mapping (Helms et al. 2008; Weiskopf et al. 2013) or the incorporation of diffusion-tensor imaging measurements could more reliably capture WM. Nevertheless, the WM maps produced are consistent with the known anatomy and the complementary techniques of visual inspection, TBM, and ROI-based trajectory analysis give consistent results."

This approach compares effect sizes for a particular risk factor-disease association between the general population and groups of relatives with different levels of relatedness (i.e. full siblings, half-siblings, cousins). If the effect size decreases in groups of relatives, compared with general population, this indicates that the association may be explained by shared familial confounding. Using co-relative control analysis, Kendler and colleagues reported that lower cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and ONAP is unlikely to be explained by familial confounding. Furthermore, premorbid cognitive deficits in psychosis may be the result of unique environmental factors (Kendler et al.

2015a, 2017a). Concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated during acute psychotic episodes, which tend to normalise after recovery but continue to be elevated in treatment-resistant patients (Potvin et al.
2008; Miller et al.
2011; Goldsmith et al.
2016). Elevated serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP in childhood/ adolescence are associated with increased risks of psychotic symptoms or diagnosis of schizophrenia subsequently in adulthood (Khandaker et al.
2014; Metcalf et al.
2017), which indicates that reverse causality is an unlikely explanation for the observed association between low-grade inflammation and psychosis. A functional genetic variant in the IL-6R gene known to dampen down inflammation (Ferreira et al.
2013) is protective for psychosis and/or severe depression (Khandaker et al.
2017b) and physical illness commonly comorbid with psychosis such as coronary heart disease (IL6R Genetics Consortium & Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, 2012) as shown using Mendelian randomisation.

The data provide a unique opportunity for epidemiological investigations; see Ahlborg et al. (1973).

Further analyses were carried out adjusting for potential confounders, and after excluding 622 participants hospitalised within 2 years of conscription to minimise reverse causality. Second, we performed co-relative analyses to determine whether HRs for the association between ESR and schizophrenia or ONAP changed as a function of family relatedness. To this end, we applied stratified Cox regression models on respective outcomes in the general population, cousin, half-sibling, and full-sibling pairs. For analyses of relative pairs, robust standard errors were calculated to adjust for family relatedness, that is, we included a cluster effect of each family pair. Furthermore, relative pairs falling into equal ESR bands were excluded to allow identifiability/convergence of the statistical model. We tested the proportionality assumption across all models. We also performed co-relative analyses of the ESR-IQ association.

For these analyses, we used logistic and linear regression models. We tested mediation by calculating direct and indirect effects of ESR on psychoses. Mediation analysis of the ESR-psychoses relationship by IQ was not conducted for outcome schizophrenia as the unadjusted main analysis did not reach statistical significance, which is a prerequisite for testing mediation. However, mediation analysis for the outcome of ONAP was conducted using the subgroups of individuals with ESR of 0–3 mm/h or 7–10 mm/h, in which main analyses had shown an association between ESR and psychosis. We were also able to run mediation analyses of these ESR groups for both schizophrenia and ONAP when adjusting for covariates.

2009). In future, longitudinal studies are required. Cognitive impairments associated with acute inflammatory conditions observed in experimental studies of humans and animals may be part of a ‘sickness response’, which is mediated by effector molecules such as cytokines (Reichenberg et al.
2001). Chronic low-grade inflammation, as indexed by elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers, has also been associated with cognitive impairments in elderly individuals (Gorelick, 2010) and with lower IQ in children (MacKinnon et al.
2017). In the elderly, such effects may involve vascular changes in the brain parenchyma induced by subtle but chronic elevations in inflammatory mediators associated with aging and other factors (Casserly & Topol, 2004). In children, however, potential mechanisms are less clear, and might involve effects of inflammatory cytokines on brain development and functioning (Spencer et al.

A Previous study has shown that higher levels of IL-6 at age 9 are associated with increased risk for psychotic symptoms at 18 years (Khandaker et al.
2014). Other studies have reported an association between higher levels of CRP at baseline and subsequent risk for schizophrenia at follow-up (Wium-Andersen et al.
2013; Metcalf et al.
2017). These findings are consistent with our results that ESR levels in the upper normal range are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. Protective effect of high ESR for ONAP in our sample might be due to diverse diagnoses included in this group. In a Finnish longitudinal cohort study higher CRP in adolescence was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, but not ONAP, in adulthood (Metcalf et al.
2017). We previously reported an association between lower concentrations of acute phase proteins in neonatal blood spots and diagnosis of non-affective psychosis including schizophrenia in adulthood; but did not have power to examine schizophrenia and other psychosis separately (Gardner et al.
2013). Taken together, the current studies indicate that low-grade inflammation may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but its association with ONAP is less clear, indicating that further studies looking at specific types of psychoses are required." "cambridge_university_press"
"438" "10.1017/S0033291718000831" "Results from co-relative control analyses further refine our results of the ESR-psychoses and ESR-IQ associations. The association between ESR and schizophrenia was comparable between individuals in the general population and between members of full-sibling pairs, suggesting that shared familial factors are unlikely to explain these associations fully. This suggests unique environmental exposures rather than genetic or shared environmental factors may be important. This is consistent with a Danish population-based study that reported that polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and a history of infections were independent risk-factors for schizophrenia (Benros et al.
2016). As the results for cousin and half-sibling pairs were not significant, this analysis requires replication in a different, possibly even larger sample. The ESR-IQ association, however, clearly highlighted familial influence on this association. Population-based studies do suggest that susceptibility to infection may have a genetic contribution (Cooke & Hill, 2001; Obel et al.
2010; Hwang et al.
2012), so the association of systemic inflammation and cognitive functioning might be largely based on genetic, but also shared environmental factors. Thus, our findings provide an interesting distinction: the association of low-grade inflammation with cognitive functioning might be due to shared familial factors, but its association with psychosis may be due to unique, environmental factors."

Thus, immune and neurodevelopmental mechanisms for pathogenesis of psychosis could be potentially intertwined. ESR increased the risk for both schizophrenia and ONAP (indirectly via IQ), yet also lowered risk (directly) for ONAP. Statistically, this phenomenon has been described as suppression (MacKinnon et al.
2000), in which both risk and protective factors operate together. Suppression hints towards the presence of different, opposing biological pathways, where only the sum of the direct and indirect effects of a risk factor reflects its final contribution towards causation of an illness."

ESR is a marker of systemic inflammation and it represents activation of acute phase response due to various stimuli (e.g., infection, cancer). In future, studies of more sensitive and direct measures of innate immune activity, such as IL-6 or CRP, might be helpful. We carried out a number of sensitivity analyses to explore the ESR-psychosis relationships further. There was some evidence for an association between ESR and schizophrenia for participants in the top decile of ESR distribution but effects were not robust. The analyses presented here are based on male conscripts and might not be generalisable to women. However, previous studies did not indicate any notable sex difference for the association between inflammation and cognition (Khandaker et al.
2015b; Gale et al.
2016), or for the association between inflammation and psychoses (Khandaker et al.

"442" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "A leitmotif in the nascent field of computational psychiatry [1–4] is that carefully curated cognitive tasks can be used to identify latent dimensions of decision-making. These parametrize process accounting for how the tasks are solved, and are identified according to the models that best fit behaviour. Individuals are characterized according to their coordinates in these dimensions and it is by this means that dysfunction is delineated. A number of such dimensions, quantifying features such as reward and punishment sensitivity [5,6], uncertainty [7,8], exploration [9], metacognition [10], interpersonal modelling [11] have been extensively investigated in laboratory tasks." "plos"
"443" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "However, to characterize individuals in a psychometrically competent manner, it does not suffice to have external validity in terms of indices of development and pathology. Temporal stability is also crucial [12,13].Stability and related psychometric properties are increasingly important as computational psychiatry moves from describing differences between selected groups of individuals, for example well vs. ill groups, to describing individual change attributable to development, vulnerability to psychopathology, and recovery from psychiatric disorder. Stability is also crucial if computational parameters are to guide diagnosis and personalized psychiatry. Unstable measures may have predictive value [14,15], especially if their variability can be understood [16], but cannot easily characterise individual trajectories. It is unclear whether computational tasks that have been well validated in the laboratory, and which are starting to be used in epidemiological samples studies [17,18], have psychometric properties sufficient to pinpoint individual dispositions. In particular, while learning tasks are amongst the most popular in computational psychiatry, it is not clear if they bear repetition, for instance whether the identity of the best fitting process model remains the same when they are applied again. Furthermore, we often do not know if parameters inferred by using these best models are psychometrically reliable, covarying with traits, or change with the individual’s state and experience." "plos"
"444" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Here, we study the population distribution and psychometrics of a paradigmatic computational measure, namely the extent to which an individual’s decision-making is guided by Pavlovian influences [19]. This is the direct predisposition to prefer particular actions in response to features of a stimulus, such as the appetitive or aversive consequences that it predicts. This predisposition can help or hinder instrumental behaviour, which is defined in terms of the contingency between action and outcome. Pavlovian biases have often been studied because of their translational relevance for anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other disorders [20–23]. The incidence of psychiatric symptoms where Pavlovian influences have been implicated rises in adolescence. For example, we recently described a peak in mood symptoms in a large non-clinical sample around the age of 16 in females [13]. It is thus important to examine how Pavlovian influences vary with age as well as characteristics such as mood, sex and IQ [1]. This in turn makes psychometric questions related to tasks assessing Pavlovian phenomena particularly pressing." "plos"
"445" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Pavlovian influences elicited by predictions of reward and punishment have been extensively studied through variants of a Go-NoGo task [19,24–26]. Here, subjects prefer to execute, rather than withhold, actions in proportion to their expectations of winning money. This Pavlovian ‘bias’ is quantified as a perturbation of a standard reinforcement learning model, using a form of bonus that is proportional to the predicted value associated with the stimuli concerned [25]. This rewards ‘Go’ actions in the face of ‘potential win’ stimuli and ‘No-Go’ actions in the face of ‘potential loss’ stimuli." "plos"
"446" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "To assess Pavlovian bias and associated decision-making characteristics, we used an orthogonalised Go-NoGo task, wherein optimal decisions (Go vs. NoGo) are independent of the goal outcome (winning vs. avoiding loss). This has been extensively validated to assess Pavlovian bias, while much is known about neural function in this task [19,24,25,27]. We administered it on two occasions (termed ‘baseline’ and ‘long follow-up’) in a large, naturalistic, epidemiologically informed sample of 14 to 24 year olds [28]. We first validated the class of reinforcement-learning models developed in the laboratory in this population. In the process, we asked which model best described behaviour and ascertained that estimates of Pavlovian bias were robust with respect to secondary modelling details. We considered a model with differential sensitivity to wins and losses, which Guitart-Masip et al, 2014, found to fit behaviour best (‘valenced-sensitivity’ model). We also considered variants, particularly equal sensitivity to wins and losses, but differential learning to these outcomes (‘valenced-learning model’). We then compared the psychometric properties of the best models using real but also simulated data. We examined the external validity of the best models by assessing correlations between parameter values and the variables of age, IQ and mood. Calendar age is a key variable in development, albeit not the same as developmental time [29–31]. IQ is also an important yardstick, as theoretical [32] and experimental [33] findings motivate further examination of its relationship with Pavlovian tendencies. Specifically, we argued that in the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task used here, efficient instrumental learning rather than reliance on non-instrumental Pavlovian biases is most profitable. Therefore, participants with higher IQ might be expected to rely less on Pavlovian guidance. Finally, we used the ‘Mood and Feelings Questionnaire’, or MFQ for external validation. This was motivated by two considerations: first, research has suggested links between Pavlovian bias and so-called internalizing disorders [20,21,26]. Second, we have found that MFQ is a good simple proxy for the ‘general psychopathology factor’ (see S1 Fig and [13]). It may thus shed light into how Pavlovian bias contributes to psychiatric vulnerability or resilience in general, although further research should address associations with other, specific dimensions of psychopathology." "plos"
"447" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We examined longitudinal changes and correlations, particularly concerning the best fitting model and the trajectory of Pavlovian parameters. First, we performed a ‘short follow-up’ study over an interval of 6 months. This is short in developmental but not in test-retest terms. It helped us to subsequently interpret the results of our main, ‘long follow-up’ study, about 18 months post-baseline. Over and above model parameters, model-fit was of over-arching importance, as it assessed how well a specific cognitive model captures individual behaviour. We then explored the dependence of model-fit on age, task repetition and IQ." "plos"
"448" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We tested three hypotheses for the trajectory of the Pavlovian parameter. One is that the bias characterising an individual was a trait that remained stable over the time of our study. Alternatively, it might reflect a slowly changing developmental disposition, specifically one where younger participants were more strongly guided by Pavlovian biases. A third possibility is that Pavlovian biases reflected prior beliefs not only dependent on the context of ‘opportunity’ (appetitive trials) or ‘threat’ (aversive trials), but also dependent on other features of the context, such as ‘task taking place in a particular laboratory’. In the latter case, participants could update their prior beliefs about a link between appetitiveness and the appropriate action across test sessions." "plos"

We report uncorrected Pearson r for approximately Gaussian quantities and Spearman ρ for non-Gaussian ones, using parameters inferred from the preferred model variant that emerged from model-comparisons.

However, for the ‘late’ trials (Fig 3B) the improvement in median fraction of correct responses in G2AL was modest compared to those of NG2W. Hence, median performance in the latter now matched the former (baseline difference: -0.6%, pcor < 0.05; long follow-up difference: -0.6%, pcor = NS).

We assessed whether the identity of the best-fitting model remained the same over testing sessions, and whether estimates of Pavlovian bias were robust to secondary modelling considerations. We expected correlations for each task parameter across time to be positive. Accordingly, we report uncorrected p’s for Spearman correlations and Wilcoxon paired t-tests.

Importantly, these two models produced very similar estimates for the parameters of interest here (r = 0.88 between models for the Pavlovian parameters, r = 0.93 for Go-bias, p <<1e-05). A variant of the valenced-senstivity model, the ‘sensitivity ratio’ model, also furnished highly similar Pavlovian bias estimates (e.g. r = 0.93, p <<1e-05 with valenced-learning). As a quality check, the ‘irreducible noise’ parameters, which quantify lack of attention and motivation-independent lapses, were reassuringly low (5–7%). In the long follow-up sample the valenced-learning model again obtained an advantage, here of 275.6 BIC units over the second-best, valenced-sensitivity model." "plos"
"463" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "However, the mean advantage of the winning model per participant was only 0.15 BIC units at baseline, while the typical individual uncertainty in iBIC, estimated as the SD of BIC scores refitted to data generated using the exact mean population value of each parameter for the winning model, was 7.9 units. Thus, while evidence of >250 BIC units is considered overwhelming by conventional standards [34], we asked if in studies with N>500 it might arise by chance and, as importantly, what difference in predictive power it signifies. Using a paired Wilcoxon test to compare fits for the two models for the data obtained in the first (baseline) testing session gave p = 0.09, while for the long follow-up Wilcoxon p was 1.7e-4, overall providing evidence against a false positive finding. Similarly, using integrated likelihood estimates at the individual level yielded values of approximate protected exceedance probabilities of 0.569 for baseline and 0.974 for long follow-up in favour of valenced-learning [35]. However, when we asked if having a greater likelihood for the one model at baseline implied a similar ordering at long follow-up, a chi-square test showed no evidence (p = 0.38). Numerical studies later showed that even if individuals’ employment of a particular model [valenced learning or sensitivity] remained fixed, and so constituted a ‘type’, our relatively brief experiment would be under-powered to allocate individuals to their type reliably (see S1 Appendix, ‘In silico simulated agents’ reliability and biases’)."

Even at long follow-up, this difference was very small, mean ΔPpt = 0.0011, compared to a grand mean prediction probability per trial, Ppt = 0.64. We also introduced a new out-of-sample, or ‘left out likelihood’ (LOL) comparison method, suitable for tasks involving learning which present challenges for predictive tests. This is important, as predictive tests do not rely on the approximations inherent in the BIC and become more and more powerful as datasets become larger (interested readers are referred to the Methods section for validation and details). LOL testing confirmed in an unbiased manner that the likely difference in predictive power between the two best models was very small, interquartile range of ΔPpt -0.012 to 0.0026.

ΔPpt estimated by out-of-sample prediction of the 48th and 96th trials for each participant on a test subsample of N = 255. This out-of-sample comparison is more variable, but the resampling-based 95% confidence interval (CI) of the median difference is -0.0012 to 0.0026, consistent with A.

Four within-model significant correlations were consistently found at baseline and long follow-up. The Pavlovian bias was anticorrelated with both learning rates, while the motivational exchange rate correlated with the Go-bias and anticorrelated with irreducible noise. The motivational exchange rate is also known as reward sensitivity or inverse decision temperature. It can be seen as the power that a unit of additional reward (or loss) has to shift behaviour off indifference between choices. The correlations were also significant in the long follow-up sample (Pav. bias vs. appetitive and aversive learning rates: ρ = -0.14, -0.19, p = 0.016, 0.00011; motiv.

This estimate showed modest stability across time (Spearman ρ = 0.146, p = 5.4e-4; Fig 6A) but there was a significant reduction in its mean (p = 0.0019), largely attributable to a closing of the gap between G2W-NG2W (Fig 6B).

Other parameters also related significantly to IQ, notably motivational exchange rate (r = 0.27, pcor< 1e-10), appetitive learning rate (r = 0.11, pcor = 0.044) and aversive learning rate (r = 0.19, pcor < 1e-05). IQ strongly correlated with overall model fit (r = 0.28, pcor
< 1e-10). In the long follow-up sample the model fit (r = 0.31, pcor
< 1e-10), motivational exchange rate (r = 0.24, pcor
< 1e-05), and lapse rate (r = -0.14, pcor
= 0.014), but no other parameter, correlated with IQ. Regressing IQ on the (log) appetitive and aversive sensitivities of the valenced-sensitivity model obtained a multiple r-squared of 6.1%, whereas the single beta of the valenced-learning model absorbed 7.6% of the variance in IQ." "plos"
"477" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We then examined the distributions of parameters and of model fit for evidence of sub-grouping. We used the baseline data for this screening, as it was epidemiologically most representative. There was no evidence for sub-grouping in the parameters, but there was for the fit measures, where a bimodal distribution was evident (Fig 8A). This motivated analysis of the joint distribution of baseline and long follow-up model-fit measures. This was best described by a mixture of two major, approximately equipopulous, Gaussian components and two somewhat less prominent ones (Fig 8B). This means that the behaviour of the high-likelihood clusters is much more predictable (less random) according to our models." "plos"
"478" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We performed a mixed-effects analysis (here, controlling for re-test) to draw out differences between the clusters in terms of Mood, IQ and task parameters. As expected, we found differences between sub-groups in integrated likelihood (by construction) and motivational exchange rates and irreducible noise, which are closely related. More interesting, we found a consistent pattern across parameters and IQ, where the cluster which fit worse at both time points (blue or 4 in Fig 8) did significantly worse than most in all performance-sensitive measures, and had increased Pavlovian bias compared to clusters 2 and 3 (2 and 3 had the better fit at follow-up, Fig 8B). Pavlovian bias did not differ amongst the other clusters, while cluster 4 had greater IQ than the others. See ‘S2 Appendix: Clustering analyses’, for statistical details and illustration." "plos"
"479" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Finally, we performed in silico analyses to determine whether the fitting procedure could reliably recover known parameters, and whether it might introduce spurious correlations between them (see S1 Appendix, ‘In silico simulated agents’ reliability and biases’ for details). Recoverability in silico was much better than stability in vivo, suggesting that the former is not a limiting factor in our study. Similarly, no spurious correlation was observed between the Pavlovian bias and learning rates, which means that the associations between them seen in the real data are likely to reflect a true feature of the study population rather than a modelling artefact."

"480" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We report the first longitudinal assessment of the psychometric properties of a key computational parameter, namely the Pavlovian bias. We did this in a large, epidemiologically-based study of young people. The Go-NoGo task that we used yielded informative results in terms of the cognitive process likely to operate, the evolution over time of the parameters of that process, the construct validity of the model parameters in question and also useful methodological considerations." "plos"
"481" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We found behaviour was well fit by two models, the winning one having two different learning rates for reward and loss but a single sensitivity to returns, and the other having a single learning rate, but two different sensitivities. This is consistent with, but also finesses, recent results stressing the dependence of learning rates on outcome valence, especially in young people [37,38]. We compared models not only on the basis of approximations to the statistical evidence for each, but also on their ability to predict left-out decisions. The dual-learning model fit better, but there was no evidence for a clear allocation of model type to individuals. Model-fit improved with practice and was greater for subjects with higher IQ. Estimates of the Pavlovian bias were robust to model type, but their test-retest stability was weak, limiting inferences about individual development. At the group level, Pavlovian bias decreased when participants were re-tested 1–2 years post-baseline." "plos"
"482" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Pavlovian bias changed over test sessions, but not over age, in a characteristic pattern. In terms of hypotheses we set out to test, we interpret this as strong evidence against this parameter, as measured by this task, being a fixed stable trait. Second, we interpret a longer follow-up resulting in the same reduction in Pavlovian bias as the short one as modest evidence against this bias being a disposition slowly changing with development. The pattern is most strongly supportive of a hypothesis that Pavlovian bias approximates an experience-dependent prior expectation. Of course, our models do not directly compute the ‘probability that in an appetitive context, the correct decision is to act’, which would formally be a belief. However, an agent using such a belief would prefer Pavlovian-congruent actions, and a weakening of such a belief with experience would lead to weakening of this preference, so the evolution of Pavlovian parameters approximates beliefs or expectancies about contingency. The fact that model-fit was good and improved with time, yet parameters changed, argues against a fixed disposition. The virtual absence of cross-sectional age dependency of the parameters, and shifts being as pronounced after 6 months as after 1–2 years, argues against spontaneous slow development and for an effect of practice. Lack of strong age dependency of performance has been observed in other reinforcement learning tasks (e.g. [37] in adolescents vs. adults), but both performance and cognitive parameter age dependencies very much depend on the specific details of the task at hand [39,40]. Practice effects may have affected the improvement in the extent to which people were described by our models. Selective attrition may also have affected our data, though a follow-up rate of 68% is reassuring here. However, attrition may have rendered the long follow-up sample epidemiologically less representative than the baseline one." "plos"
"483" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "In this task, the Pavlovian bias aids performance in two conditions, and harms it in the other two. If one interprets the bias as a heuristic that is generally useful, the fact that it reduces with repeated testing is consistent with its approximating a prior belief which can be at least partially overwhelmed by evidence, rather than being rigidly hard-wired by genetics and the early-childhood environment. This may apply more generally to other cognitive biases, and may happen over multiple timescales. Our study only employed a limited number of follow-up occasions, making it difficult to discern longitudinal changes not due to practice effects. In this study, any age, gender or mood dependency of Pavlovian bias, if present, was too subtle to resolve." "plos"
"484" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Psychometrically, the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task had the capacity to provide reliable estimates of Pavlovian bias, in that parameter recovery in silico was greater than 80%. At the same time, in human participants stability was reduced down to ~ 10–15%. The return sensitivity parameter was more stable. However, the stability of task measures was considerably lower than those for IQ and even mood, and lower than that conventionally required for tracing developmental trajectories [41]." "plos"
"485" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Model fit emerged as important, over and above individual parameters, being the most stable task measure. It classified participants into clusters with discernible longitudinal trajectories (Fig 8 and S2 Appendix). The most striking differences were observed between a cluster consisting of people who showed poor at both time points (4 in Fig 8B and S2 Appendix) and the rest. These participants were characterized by a higher Pavlovian bias and lower IQ than the rest, as well as by higher decision-noise parameters. Mood did not differ between any clusters. Poorly fitting participants may have followed a strategy less well captured by our models, or may have been irreducibly more stochastic. In either case, model-fitting causes decision-variability parameters to absorb this high variance, whether its cause is hidden cognitive variables that are as yet not represented in the models, or random noise. It would be interesting to use less constrained machine-learning models to estimate the upper limit on the amount of variance in the data that cognitive-mechanism models like ours hope to explain, and thus help interpret decision variability parameters [42]. Overall, model-fit emerged as a potentially important measure to classify developmental trajectories in future research." "plos"
"486" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We found that IQ correlated with motivational exchange rates, and indeed model fit. That is, the behaviour of those with higher IQ was more affected by a unit improvement in objective outcome, over and above differences in learning and bias. This is what one would expect if IQ test scores were themselves dependent on how motivating the participants considered finding the correct answers in the IQ tests. This is in turn consistent with evidence that IQ test scores can be increased by material incentives and that motivation in the absence of additional incentives predicts real-life outcomes [43]. Likewise, confidence is linked to both IQ and motivation [44]. Our motivational exchange rates may thus reflect ability-dependent confidence, important for development during youth. Tasks involving simple inference about counter-intuitive contingencies, building on our Go-NoGo task, may be useful in exploring these relations. Furthermore, the neural process underpinning reductions in Pavlovian bias would be interesting to elucidate, as it has been suggested that top-down processes actively suppress this bias in more able participants [45]. Alternatively, reductions in Pavlovian bias occurring over time or across IQ groups in young people may relate to differences in fixed, for the duration of the experiment, Pavlovian parameters integral to associative-learning systems (bpav in Eq 3) like those of our models." "plos"
"487" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Though not affecting our central hypotheses, model-comparison analyses raised important questions as to how young people learn differentially from loss and gain events. The fact that behaviour could be explained almost equally well either by recourse to valenced-learning or to valenced-sensitivity, merits further study. Learning rates and sensitivities can be distinguished [46], but the present task was not optimized to do so. A larger number of trials, for example, could help resolve this ambiguity. In terms of our models, subjects behaved either as if volatility were higher for loss compared to gain contexts (faster aversive learning), or were loss averse (higher aversive sensitivity). If appetitive and aversive sensitivities are valid concepts, they should be similar in comparable but learning-free settings, such as well-learnt versions of this task (improved from [26]). Based on the present results, we hypothesize that in a task capable of simultaneously resolving the valence-dependence of preference (valenced sensitivity) and of learning (valenced learning), the two sensitivities would be closer to each other than suggested by a pure valenced-sensitivity model, but would not be identical, as they would also be informed by loss aversion." "plos"
"488" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We studied the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task because it is well established, widely used, specialized to assess Pavlovian bias, and could provide insights (especially about decision noise and model fit) likely to be relevant to other computational tasks. However, the findings reported here should be used with caution in other contexts. Further insights about Pavlovian bias may be provided by existing paradigms [47], but testing for the putative experience-independent core of this bias with a brief task, suitable for developmental research, could be facilitated by an adaptive design. We suggest maximizing the number of plateau-performance trials by adaptively looking for the true indifference point between the effective values of the actions (q, not Q, in Eq 3). An experience-independent Pavlovian bias would mean that in the appetitive domain, the reward for the ‘No-Go’ action has to be (adaptively) boosted by an amount proportional to the mean reward of ‘Go’ and ‘No-Go’ in order to achieve indifference between these two choices. Similarly, in an aversive context the value of ‘No-Go’ has to be adaptively penalized by an amount proportional to the average of the loss returns for the two choices to achieve indifference. For symmetric average returns, the mean of the (absolute) adaptive boost and adaptive penalty components would be proportional to the Pavlovian bias, and the difference between these adaptive amounts would be the ‘Go bias’."

"489" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Methodologically, the present work extends the use of left-out-likelihood based model comparisons. These furnish outcomes that are directly intuitive and convenient for further statistical comparisons, as well as being free of approximations inherent in the BIC. On the other hand, they are much more computationally intensive and will require further refinement to render their use routine." "plos"
"490" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "In conclusion, we show that Pavlovian influences characterizing young people are well described at the epidemiological level by established reinforcement-learning models. Practice and higher IQ correlated with weaker Pavlovian influences, while higher IQ scores were also associated with higher motivation to attain a given reward, suggesting important neurodevelopmental relationships. However, neither the Pavlovian bias parameter nor other key task measures met conventional psychometric standards for temporal stability or for external validity with respect to age and psychiatric symptoms, attributes useful in characterizing individual variability and individual change. It is a matter for further research whether similar problems affect other computational tasks, but our study does give urgency to the work of establishing the psychometric properties of such tasks and the parameters associated with computational models them. Studies aiming to characterize individual trajectories of decision-making will benefit from psychometrically improved computational tasks, which better exclude experience-dependent components, as well as designs that include more follow-up points."

"491" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We used an orthogonalized Go-NoGo task that contrasts a propensity to act, rather than not to do so, in context involving opportunity (‘win’) versus threat (‘avoid loss’). Participants were presented with four different abstract stimuli each of which had a constant, but unknown, association with a correct policy. The correct policy was either to emit (‘Go’) or to withhold (‘NoGo’) an action, here involving a button press. If the correct decision was made, the better of two outcomes was realised with probability 0.8. This better outcome was null (as opposed to a loss) for two stimuli and positive (as opposed to null) for the other two. The task closely followed a previously published paradigm [25], with some slight simplifications, unrelated to the core biases assessed by the task. These simplifications helped deliver it to a community sample, on a large scale and in the context of a multi-task battery. First, implementing the decision ‘Go’ was simpler, i.e. not dependent on any target features, unlike the original task in which the ‘Go’ action could be either ‘left’ or ‘right’ depending on the location of a target. This allowed trials to be shorter. However, time pressure from the remaining task battery (to be reported separately), meant that subjects performed a more restricted sample of 144 trials. Second, task clarity was improved by informing participants before performing the task that the outcome probabilities were 0.8 and 0.2. Third, motivation was made explicit by telling participants that they were playing for real money, that random performance would attract zero extra fee and excellent performance could be worth about five pounds sterling additional earnings. These changes were supported by piloting the whole battery in which the task was embedded, as we describe next." "plos"
"492" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We took precautions to ensure that the fact that the task was delivered as part of a battery did not affect the power for testing the hypotheses in question. The battery of which this task was part of consisted of 7 tasks and took over 2.5 hours to complete, whereas the task analysed here took about 23 minutes to complete, longer than the average in the battery. We first examined data from previous, longer versions of the task and performed a pilot of 15 participants. In addition to quantitative data, these participants were de-briefed in detail by trained research assistants (RAs) who interviewed them as to whether they found the tasks tiring, interesting or difficult. Although quantitative data were in line with the literature, qualitative data suggested that some participants might, subjectively, be affected by tiredness but most importantly some found the task hard to work out and felt discouraged by this. Therefore, first, the randomization of the order of tasks in the battery was constrained, so that this task took place within the first hour of testing. Second, research assistants were assertive in enforcing short breaks between tasks and emphasizing the importance of attending to the task. Third, they reminded participants that they were playing for real money and that all decisions counted approximately equally, in monetary terms, encouraging attention to each decision rather than assume that shorter tasks paid as much as longer ones. Fourth, participants were reassured that they should not be discouraged if the best answers were not clear to them as the task progressed, but on the contrary they should proceed by trial and error and the best answers were then likely to gradually ‘sink in’. This is consistent with the Rescorla-Wagner model that we used to analyse the data. After the first 50 participants were tested under careful RA supervision, an interim analysis of the whole battery and more limited feedback from RAs was reviewed. This gave no cause for concern with respect to the present task and the quantitative parameters extracted were reassuringly compatible with those from historical laboratory samples (as well as the Results reported here)."

First, the values of actions (‘Q values’) were calculated based on a learning rate λv. We use ‘v’ subscripts to indicate that, in different variants of the model, the parameter in question may be valenced, i.e. different for ‘win’ and ‘avoid-loss’ trials. In the valenced-sensitivity model all trial types shared the same learning rate but different motivational exchange rates ρv were used depending on trial valence:

"500" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Crucially, the conventional Q values were biased by two terms representing an overall tendency towards action (‘Go bias’) and a Pavlovian bias (towards action or inaction) that depended on valence (state value):
qt(at,st)=Qt(at,st)+bgo(at)+bpav(at)Vt(st)(3)
where the two bias coefficients b are zero unless at=Go. In effect this means that the No-Go action was taken as a comparator, and the Go action was either penalized (in aversive contexts) or boosted (in appetitive ones) proportional to the value of the respective stimulus. Finally, the policy probability for choosing an action was given by the softmax function, modulated by a lapse rate parameter ξ:
p(at|st)=(1−ξ)exp(q(at,st))∑k(exp(q(ak,st))+ξ2(4)" "plos"
"501" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Thus the motivational exchange rates ρv acted as an inverse temperature parameter for the softmax by scaling the outcome values in Eq 1, which then fed into Eq 4 via Eq 3." "plos"

In these ‘forgetting models’ models, we argued that during long periods when, by chance, a particular stimulus was not observed, the associated actions might drift back to zero if participants brought to the task a (strictly unjustified, but common-sensical) assumption that values might be subject to non-zero volatility. The other models assumed that the value of stimuli not seen in a particular trial would not change." "plos"
"504" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "Third, the appetitive and aversive sensitivities of the valenced-sensitivity model were transformed into an overall sensitivity and an appetitive/aversive ratio (‘sensitivity ratio model’). This had two motivational exchange parameters, just like the valenced sensitivity model, but formulated them as an appetitive sensitivity and a sensitivity ratio. Therefore, at the level of the individual it was identical to the valenced sensitivity model. At the group level, the expectation-maximization fit used prior distributions for the parameters that were independent of each other. In the case of the valenced sensitivity model, this means that the distribution of appetitive sensitivity over the population was modelled as independent to the aversive one. For the sensitivity-ratio model, a positive mean for the population distribution of the eponymous parameter would encode a positive correlation between appetitive and aversive exchange rates. Model fits favoured the former model." "plos"

Specifically, we used the expectation-maximization algorithm in [25], modifying MATLAB [49] code provided by Dr. Quentin Huys. We estimated the ‘integrated likelihood’ and ‘integrated BIC’ measures used in that work (Eq 5), using the same sampling technique.

We tested whether the model-fitting procedure was robust to assumptions about the distribution of parameter values in the population (S1 Appendix). We tested two assumptions that were particularly relevant to Pavlovian bias. First, we allowed the population distribution of Pavlovian bias to be normal rather than log-normal. Using mean and variance population estimates derived from the real data, this translated to the presence of a small tail of negative values (S1 Appendix). Second, we tested whether model-fitting was sensitive to the precise form of the population distributions used, e.g. gamma rather than log-normal. Recovery of Pavlovian bias parameters was reassuringly robust in the face of such twists (S1 Appendix)." "plos"
"507" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "In order to go beyond comparing models by using simple approximations like the BIC, we argued that better models should provide a higher likelihood for data on which they were not trained, compared to less good models. To do this, we fitted models as best as possible to everyone, leaving out certain test trials. Then we compared the sum-log-probability of the actual responses participants provided on these left-out trials, thus performing paired left-out-likelihood (LOL) comparisons. Confidence intervals around this difference of predictability-per-trial provide an intuitive measure of how much better one model is than another, especially when compared to the average predictability-per-participant-decision."

"508" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "For the LOL comparison to be optimal, models must be given the best possible chance to describe the individuals whose parameters are used to derive the LOLs. In order to do this, we first divided the sample into a 300-strong ‘group training’ set and a test set. The ‘group training set’ was used to provide the best possible descriptive statistics of the entire population in terms of the means and variances of each (transformed) parameter. These were the group-level parameters fitted by the type-2 maximum-likelihood procedure (S3 Fig)." "plos"
"509" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We then used these group-level parameters to provide priors for fitting the remaining ‘test set’, from which the ‘test trials’ were left out. Markov-chain monte-carlo (MCMC) fitting at the level of the individual participant was performed, using the sum-log-posterior over the included, non- left-out, trials only to derive posterior beliefs about parameters for each participant in the test sample. During fitting, MCMC efficiently provided sum-log-likelihood samples over the left-out-trials, thus forming the integrated LOL. Two trials were left-out, as described below. LOLs were not taken into account for parameter estimation, to avoid double-dipping. We repeated the procedure with different candidate models, thus obtaining (paired) model comparisons of their predictive power over the hidden trials only." "plos"

When a limited amount of data per participant is available, greater numbers of LOTs result in noisier parameter estimates for each model, making it more difficult to detect differences between models. Furthermore, it is not a priori known how model fit may deteriorate as a function of the number of LOTs for different models. Hence, it makes sense to use the minimum number of LOTs and rely on our high number of participants to power model comparisons. In order to assess whether these considerations were important in practice, we generated synthetic data using the valenced-sensitivity model, the best in the literature. Using synthetic data we compared LOL using the procedure above with the true LOL according to the generative parameters. S4 Fig shows how increasing the number of LOTs significantly degraded the power of the true generative model to explain LOT data." "plos"

Because learning occurs in every trial, learners follow different trajectories in the included trials depending on what happens in the left-out trials. Thus, even if the LOL is not used during model fitting, information from the LOTs may influence the fitted parameters, thus potentially biasing fitted parameters towards values most consistent with the participant’s choices (and hence high likelihood thereof) in the LOTs. Thankfully, we do not have to guard against every possible such influence, but only to make sure that using information from the LOTs (which stimuli where shown, which responses were performed and which returns were obtained) does not unduly bias the estimation of parameters based on the included trials towards values that make the LOTs appear more likely. In order to reassure ourselves about this, we performed a series of numerical experiments where we compared using the information above, to marginalizing over the above responses and rewards." "plos"

To investigate this matter, we first performed a numerical experiment with a simple Rescorla-Wagner model with learning parameter ε, making binary choices between alternatives via a softmax function of known parameter τ = 0.1 (i.e. a bare-bones version of our models). We generated 10000 x 28 trial epochs, for three levels of ε = 0.05, 0.15 and 0.25. Returns were deterministic returns (action1 → 1, action2 → 5), starting values for each run: Q0(action1) = Q0(action2) = 0. The first 8 trials were hidden. We looked for bias by examining how our estimate of p(h|v,M) depended on whether p(v|ε,M) is estimated using ‘informed’ visible trials, p(i)(v|ε,M), or ‘agnostic’ ones (i.e., marginalizing over hidden trials), p(a)(v|ε,M). A typical example of how p(i)(v|ε,M) may differ from p(a)(v|ε,M) is shown in S5 Fig. Although they gave different results for each individual subject, there was no difference (and no bias) with respect to the estimates over the hidden trials for any level of ε examined. This is shown in S6A Fig. It is interesting to note that some simple measures were biased in the expected way; for example, the maximum-likelihood estimate of the learning rate based on the ‘informed’ method was closer to the maximum-likelihood estimate over the hidden trials compared to the equivalent ‘agnostic’ estimate. In the case of ε = 0.15 this was by 0.03 log units, Wilcoxon p < 1e-08." "plos"
"514" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We then examined two further models, an η-greedy learner and an ‘observation-violating η-greedy’ learner. The latter was similar to the former, but, importantly, only updated action values for exploratory actions if they furnished a better-than-expected prediction error. We did not detect any bias in the simple η-greedy but we found a very small bias in the expected direction for the observation-violating model. The bias corresponded to 0.45% of the grand mean prediction probability. Given that this sequence of models was designed to showcase a difference between the more rigorous agnostic and the more practical informed approach, we concluded that any bias introduced by using the informed approach on our real data would be negligible."

"515" "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679" "We first compared longitudinal change with paired nonparametric tests. We also examined change using latent-change-score (LCS) models [36]. To do this we transformed the distributions of each (already transformed as above) parameter at each timepoint to normal as described below. LCS models formulate the change between baseline and follow-up as a latent variable, and estimate its mean, variance but also its possible dependence on baseline values. Pure regression towards the mean endows this change parameter with a value of -1. We used BIC and the likelihood ratio test to compare this model with nested, simpler models of change in the population distribution of parameters. Before we applied the latent-change-score formulation (S3 Appendix), we forced the marginal distributions of the transformed parameters into a Gaussian form. This further transformation-to-Gaussian to was achieved by first, estimating the mean and SD of the parameter distribution in question. Second, estimating an empirical (stepped) cumulative distribution function for this parameter with the R function edcf [50]. Third, applying an inverse-gaussian-cdf with the same mean and SD as the original. We then applied the just-identified univariate latent change score model." "plos"

"562" "10.1073/pnas.1820754116" "MRI studies of schizophrenia have robustly demonstrated local structural differences in multiple cortical areas, subcortical nuclei, and white matter tracts (1). The most parsimonious explanation of this distributed, multicentric pattern of structural change is that it reflects disruption or dysconnectivity of large-scale brain networks comprising anatomically connected brain areas. However, testing this dysconnectivity hypothesis of psychotic disorder has been constrained by the fundamental challenges in measuring anatomical connectivity and brain anatomical networks in humans. The principal imaging methods available for this purpose are tractographic analysis of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and structural covariance analysis of conventional MRI. DWI-based tractography generally underestimates the strength of long-distance anatomical connections: for example, between bilateral homologous areas of cortex. Structural covariance analysis is not applicable to single-subject analysis, and its biological interpretation is controversial (2)." "national_academy_of_sciences"
"563" "10.1073/pnas.1820754116" "We recently proposed a technique known as “morphometric similarity mapping” (3), which quantifies the similarity between cortical areas in terms of multiple MRI parameters measured at each area and can be used to construct whole-brain anatomical networks for individual subjects. In keeping with histological results indicating that cytoarchitectonically similar areas of cortex are more likely to be anatomically connected (4), morphometric similarity in the macaque cortex was correlated with tract-tracing measurements of axonal connectivity. Compared with both tractographic DWI-based networks and structural covariance networks, morphometric similarity networks included a greater proportion of connections between human cortical areas of the same cytoarchitectonic class. Individual differences in regional mean morphometric similarity or “hubness” of cortical nodes in morphometric similarity networks accounted for about 40% of the individual differences in intelligence quotient (IQ) in a sample of 300 healthy young people.

We mapped case–control morphometric similarity differences at global and nodal levels of resolution individually in each dataset to assess replicability, and we tested for significant differences in network organization that were consistent across studies. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to test the hypothesis that this MRI network phenotype of psychosis was correlated with anatomically patterned gene expression using data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). This analytical approach to combine imaging and genomic data has been methodologically established (6, 7) and applied in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders (8, 9). We used it to test the pathogenic hypothesis that the genes most strongly associated with case–control differences in morphometric similarity were enriched: (i) for genes that have been ontologically linked to relevant neurobiological processes and (ii) for genes that are abnormally expressed in post mortem studies of schizophrenia."

Prior work also showed that morphometrically similar cortical regions are more likely to be axonally connected to each other (i.e., morphometric similarity is a proxy marker for anatomical connectivity) (3). We, therefore, interpret the reduced morphometric similarity that we observe in frontal and temporal brain regions in psychosis as indicating that there is reduced architectonic similarity or greater architectonic differentiation between these areas and the rest of the cortex, which is probably indicative of reduced anatomical connectivity to and from the less similar, more differentiated cortical areas."

"585" "10.1073/pnas.1820754116" "There is a well-evidenced and articulated prior theory of schizophrenia as a dysconnectivity syndrome; specifically, functional dysconnectivity of frontal and temporal cortical areas has been recognized as a marker of brain network disorganization in schizophrenia (19). Our results of reduced morphometric similarity in frontal and temporal cortices—implying increased architectonic differentiation and decreased axonal connectivity—are descriptively consistent with this theory. Our complementary finding of abnormally increased morphometric similarity in parietal cortex—implying increased architectonic similarity and axonal connectivity—is plausible but not so clearly precedented given the relatively limited prior data on the parietal cortex in studies of schizophrenia as a dysconnectivity syndrome (20, 21)."

"587" "10.1073/pnas.1820754116" "In an effort to connect these MRI phenotypes to the emerging genetics and functional genomics of schizophrenia, we first used PLS to identify the weighted combination of genes in the whole genome that has a cortical expression map most similar to the cortical map of case–control morphometric similarity differences. Then, we tested the mechanistic hypothesis that the genes with greatest (positive or negative) weight on PLS1 were enriched for genes previously implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

"588" "10.1073/pnas.1820754116" "We found that the genes that are normally overexpressed in frontal and temporal areas of reduced morphometric similarity in psychosis were significantly enriched for genes that are up-regulated in post mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia (15). Conversely, the genes that are normally overexpressed in parietal and other areas of increased morphometric similarity in psychosis were significantly enriched for genes that are down-regulated in post mortem data (15). This tight coupling between MRI-derived transcriptional weights and gene transcription measured histologically was highly significant and the association with up-regulated genes was replicated across three prior post mortem datasets."

The cluster of interactive proteins related to GPCR signaling included multiple proteins coded by genes previously linked to antipsychotic mechanisms of action [including DRD4 (22), HTR1 (23), NTSR1 (24), and ADRA2C (25)], reported in transcriptional studies of post mortem brain tissue [e.g., PTGER3, S1PR1, ITPR2, and EDNRB (15, 26)], or associated with risk SNPs for schizophrenia [e.g., DRD5, OPRM1, and CNR1 (27–29)].

The whole-brain data on “normal” brain tissue expression of the genome were measured post mortem in six adult brains (mean age = 43 y) and not in age-matched subjects or patients with schizophrenia (such data are not currently available to our knowledge). Also, the transcriptional experiments that we use to label genes as up- or down-regulated in schizophrenia were performed in regions of the parietal or prefrontal cortex (15), whereas the neuroimaging results are for the whole brain. We have used MRI data from three independent studies to measure morphometric similarity networks, but the studies used different scanning protocols, leading to estimation of morphometric similarity between regions on the basis of seven MRI parameters that were measurable in all studies. Future work could usefully explore the opportunity to further improve sensitivity and reliability of the morphometric similarity network biomarker of schizophrenia by optimizing and standardizing the MRI procedures to measure the most informative set of morphometric features.

Following ref. 3, the surfaces were then parcellated using an atlas with 308 cortical regions derived from the Desikan–Killiany atlas (6, 35). For each region, we estimated seven parameters from the MRI and DWI data: gray matter volume, surface area, cortical thickness, Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, FA, and mean diffusivity.

For global and regional morphometric similarity statistics alike, we fit linear models to estimate case–control difference, with age, sex, and age × sex as covariates. Our main results also replicated in subsets of the data balanced for age and sex (SI Appendix, section S5.6).

The first PLS component (PLS1) is the linear combination of the weighted gene expression scores that have a cortical expression map that is most strongly correlated with the map of case–control morphometric similarity differences. The statistical significance of the variance explained by PLS1 was tested by permuting the response variables 1,000 times. The error in estimating each gene’s PLS1 weight was assessed by bootstrapping (resampling with replacement of the 308 cortical regions), and the ratio of the weight of each gene to its bootstrap SE was used to calculate the Z scores and, hence, rank the genes according to their contribution to PLS1 (6)."

We used a permutation approach15 to estimate both the optimal number of PCA components and the statistical significance of the CCA modes.

Indeed, the scatter plots in Supplementary Fig. S9 show that only 11 brain connectivity and 11 behavioural variables overlapped when those top variables were chosen. This might be explained by the fact that we are just displaying the very top variables ranked according to their correlation value, and some correlation values simply differ from each other on the fourth decimal place.

The first CCA mode relates to an externalization/internalization axis which is associated with sex. Specifically, it suggests that males are more susceptible to disruptive behaviour and alcohol use, whilst females are more susceptible to depression and self-harm. The second CCA mode relates to a well-being/distress axis which covers positive symptoms of well-being on one side and negative symptoms related to depression, suicidal thoughts, history of sexual abuse and alcohol use on the other side. Both modes are also associated with age, which could be expected considering that the sample age range covers an important developmental period. Importantly, the brain networks related to both CCA modes align well with models of brain development highlighting the sequential maturation of subcortical and cortical regions in adolescence19,20 and models of psychopathology17,18."

"618" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Both CCA modes are conceptually associated with broadly described depressive psychopathology and can hence be seen as helping refine this clinical concept. It is therefore important to understand whether they capture distinctions in brain connectivity profiles alone or capture also distinctions in descriptive psychopathology. At first glance, the behavioural items common to both modes of depression, such as e.g. “…life was not worth living”, “I thought about dying”, “I cried a lot” might support the former hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are three clear differences:" "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"619" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Firstly, the first mode is associated with a more anxious, agitated and behaviourally-activated expression of depression (four self-harm items, “I felt sick…”, “I worried…”, “I was afraid…”, “Are you emotional?”). Conversely, the second mode is associated with a more anhedonic and amotivational state (positively correlated with “…life was not worth living”, “…nothing good for me in the future”, “…feel so sad…” and negatively correlated with “…feeling interested in other people”). Interestingly, similar ‘anxious’ and ‘anhedonic’ axes have been found in other large data-driven depression studies9,21." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"620" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Secondly, the first CCA mode is strongly correlated with sex, but the second mode is not. Thus the latter is a more sex independent dimension of psychopathology. Furthermore, depression-related variables of the first mode are associated with younger age, whilst depression-related variables of the second mode are associated with older age (Fig. 1c,d and Fig. 2). Accordingly, depression in the first CCA mode is related to behavioural items, such as e.g. “…I looked ugly”, “…my family would be better off without me”, “I worried about what my parents would say…”, which are more likely to be hallmarks of depression at a younger age. On the contrary, distress in the second CCA mode is related to items thought to characterise depression at an older age (e.g. “I thought about killing myself”, being drunk and drinking spirits)." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"621" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Thirdly, depression in the second mode is associated with sexual abuse and is negatively associated with feeling loved, confident and close to other people, perhaps indicating that sexual abuse affects these traits (however, causal attributions are not possible in this dataset)." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"622" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "The strong relationship between sex and the first CCA mode is striking in light of recent findings that there is <10% overlap in gene expression changes in the brains of male and female humans with depression – at least in the prefrontal cortex and insula (other cortical areas were not sampled)22. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that a similar lack of overlap between the sexes also exists in a chronic variable stress mouse model22. It is interesting that both insula and the prefrontal cortex dominate the connections of the first CCA mode, being either positively (insula) or negatively (prefrontal cortex) correlated with depression. This suggests that sex interacts with depression risk in these (and likely other) areas in a way that might be fundamental to the disorder." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"623" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Adolescence and early adulthood is the peak age of onset for many psychiatric disorders1,2, rendering understanding vulnerability of individuals at this age of particular relevance. Importantly, most items correlated with the CCA modes are related to psychopathology, and so the identified CCA modes might represent a two-dimensional space not only related to current depressive symptoms (or their absence), but to a latent vulnerability to psychopathology. Deeper understanding of this vulnerability may powerfully inform biologically informed interventions in young people23." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"624" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Substance use is highly correlated with psychiatric disorders24,25, and it is especially detrimental in adolescence. Personality traits have an etiological role in the development of alcohol and substance use, and a vast body of research implicates two broad personality domains with opposing action tendencies, namely inhibition and disinhibition26,27. Our results concur with such a model. Alcohol usage is associated with both of our CCA modes in opposing directions. Behavioural items resembling to a disinhibited personality (first CCA mode) are positive correlations with e.g. “…enjoy doing things that are risky and dangerous?”, “…like TV, movies, comics, or electronic games with a lot of violence in them?” or “Do you like rough games and sports?”; whereas items suggestive of an inhibited personality (second CCA mode) are negative correlations with e.g. being interested in or enjoying the company of other people, or being interested in new things." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"625" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "As discussed above, age was associated with both CCA modes. The first CCA mode correlated positively with age (depicted in red in Fig. 2), attentional and frontoparietal networks (depicted in red in Supplementary Fig. S3a–c) and negatively correlated with subcortical-subcortical connections as well as connections within the limbic system (depicted in blue in Supplementary Fig. S3a–c). These results are consistent with models of adolescent brain development, demonstrating that subcortical and limbic regions mature in early adolescence followed by the maturation of cortico-cortical connections19,20. The second CCA mode was negatively correlated with age (depicted in blue in Fig. 2), connections within and between attentional networks (depicted in blue in Supplementary Fig. S3d–f) and was positively correlated with various subcortical-cortical connections (depicted in red in Supplementary Fig. S3d–f). Again, these results corroborate the aforementioned models of adolescent brain development. In particular, the results of the two CCA modes substantiate the sequential maturation of brain circuits, namely, the fine-tuning of circuits from subcortical-subcortical (early adolescence) to cortico-subcortical (late adolescence) and cortico-cortical (young adulthood)28. Furthermore, the sequential maturation of brain circuits might be a risk factor for alcohol use29, which aligns well with the strong positive correlation between alcohol use and age found in both CCA modes (Fig. 2)." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"626" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Our connectivity results are also consistent with recent literature suggesting that most psychiatric disorders emerge as a result of impairments within a few core brain circuits and networks10,17,18. In particular, the first mode was negatively correlated with depression and connections of the default mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks (Fig. 3); whilst the second mode was negatively correlated with depression and positively correlated with many default mode areas (Fig. 4). These networks underlie core social, executive and affective cognition, respectively, and dysfunctions in these networks might result in specific domains of symptoms (e.g. alterations in default mode network connectivity resulting in impaired self-representation and social functioning)17. Interestingly, due to the strong interplay between these networks, the aberrant functioning in any of these could cause impairments of the others. For example, excessive coupling between the limbic and default mode networks could mean that initial dysfunction in the former may propagate to the latter, causing depressive symptoms10,30,31. Conversely, a default mode network that can only dominate but cannot reciprocally communicate with the limbic network could prevent positive mood being established by the latter32."

"627" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "It is common practice in statistics to estimate a model using the entire dataset, once model selection has been performed using the permutation-based approach as described above. In contrast, in machine learning a dataset is often split into training and test sets (or training/test/validation sets) using cross-validation procedures, such that the model parameters are estimated on training data and the model performance is estimated on a test data. The permutation-based approach may be preferable to cross-validation when the number of samples is not very large, since it avoids the need to split the data into even smaller sets for training and testing. However, cross-validation approaches might be preferable if one wants to measure the robustness and generalisability of the results. In the present study, we also ran CCA embedded in a multiple hold-out framework (Supplementary Methods and Fig. S6) which was proposed by Monteiro et al.16. We found one mode of covariation, which was comparable to the first one found using the permutation framework (Supplementary Fig. S9). The second mode obtained using the permutation framework was not found with the hold-out framework, potentially due to the small sample size and the strictness of the multiple hold-out framework. The most striking finding obtained with this approach was that the distribution of the subjects along the CCA main axis on the test set was very similar to the training set (Supplementary Fig. S8), which means that the CCA mode generalised for the test set."

"628" "10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3" "Finally, we acknowledge limitations to the current study. Methodological limitations relate to the pipeline choice, which includes use of an atlas, full correlation as a connectivity metric and the PCA dimensionality reduction step that might remove a significant amount of signal variability of potential interest. Further work exploring other approaches to estimating resting state connectivity (e.g. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)8 and partial correlation33) and regularised or sparse CCA could be investigated to overcome potential limitations of the current pipeline. We also acknowledge the cross-sectional nature of our analysis. Future studies involving longitudinal samples could investigate how the described brain-behaviour modes of covariation change over time or whether they are predictive of future psychopathology. In addition, although we have used a multiple hold-out framework, we should ideally use an independent replication sample to validate our model. Finally, there are limitations of sample size. Future studies including big datasets, such as the ABCD study34, will be useful to explore higher variability in general population and potentially find different dimensions of psychopathology or groups of adolescents at risk."

"654" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Autism Spectrum Conditions (henceforth ‘autism’) are characterized by difficulties in social communication alongside unusually narrow interests and restrictive, repetitive behaviours, a resistance to unexpected change and sensory hypersensitivity [1]. In addition to behavioural and clinical differences, differences in cortical morphology between individuals with autism compared to typical controls have been reported [2–5]. While heterogeneous, recent studies have reported increased cortical volumes in the first years of life with autism compared to controls, with accelerated decline or arrest in growth in adolescents [3, 4]. Changes in cortical volume may be attributed to changes in cortical thickness (CT), changes in surface area or both [3]. In support of this, studies have separately identified differences in both surface area [6] and CT [7] in children with autism. For example, Smith et al. [7] show that the developmentally accelerated gain in grey matter volume in autism is largely driven by the lack of typical age-related CT decrease (http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17010100?code=ajp-site). Furthermore, earlier studies identified differential trajectories in CT development in autism [8] as well as CT differences in autism in specific brain regions [9, 10]. In addition, Hardan et al. [11] found areas of increased CT in children with autism, predominantly in temporal and parietal lobules. In contrast however, Hadjikhani et al. [12] report a pattern of cortical thinning in adults with autism, mainly within the mirror neuron system. Both these studies point towards significant heterogeneity within findings that is at least partially related to differences in age. Despite significant heterogeneity in cortical morphology across autism imaging studies [13], recent studies have also indicated alterations in areas associated with higher cognition (e.g. language, social perception and self-referential processing) [7, 14]. This has been supported by observed differences in cortical minicolumns in association areas in individuals with autism [15]." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"655" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "It is unclear what contributes to these differences in cortical morphology in individuals with autism. Genetic factors play a major role in the development of brain networks and volumes in typically developing individuals [16–18]. For instance, twin heritability of CT measures suggest modest to high heritability for most regions of the brain [19]. In parallel, the contribution of genetic factors for autism has been estimated between 50–90% [20–22]. Different classes of genetic variation have been associated with risk for autism. Several recent studies have identified a significant contribution of rare, de novo putative loss-of-function mutations for autism [23–27]. In addition, common genetic variants, cumulatively, account for approximately half of the total variance in risk for autism [20]. Studies have also identified genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex [28–30], enriched in processes such as synaptic transmission and astrocyte and microglial genes. These dysregulated genes may either represent causal mechanisms for risk or compensatory mechanisms as a result of upstream biological and cellular changes. Genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex are also enriched in specific gene co-expression modules identified using both adult [28–30] and fetal [31] cortical post-mortem samples." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"656" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Despite considerable progress in understanding neuroanatomical and genetic risk for autism, several questions remain. Mechanistically, it is likely that genetic risk variants alter neuroanatomical structural and functional properties, contributing to behavioural and clinical phenotypes. Given the heterogeneity in autism imaging findings [13], it is pertinent to ask how genetic risk for autism is associated with variability in cortical morphology observed in individuals with autism. Thus, the goal of the present study was to identify molecular correlates of disease-related neuroanatomy irrespective of regional specific neuroanatomical differences that may not replicate well across studies [13]. Here, focusing on CT, we ask 3 specific questions: (Q1) Which genes and biological pathways are associated with in CT variability (ΔCT) in children with autism? (Q2) What is the spatial expression profile of genes associated with ΔCT? and (Q3) Are these genes enriched for three different classes of risk factors associated with autism: rare, de novo variants, common genetic variants and/or dysregulated genes in the post-mortem cortex? We address these questions by combining analysis of ΔCT in autism, as measured with MRI, with gene expression post-mortem data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS; [32, 33])."

Using median gene expression of 20,737 genes from six post-mortem cortical brain samples [32], we conduct a partial least squares regression (PLSR), a data reduction and regression technique, to identify significant genes and enriched pathways that contribute to ΔCT (Q1). We next quantified the expression of the same significant genes in terms of their spatial profile by comparing them across the different brain regions and Von Economo classes [45], which provides a way of assessing the hypothesis that there would be a global differentiation between higher order cognitive processing and more primary sensory processing (Q2). We tested any significant genes for enrichment for classes of genetic and transcriptomic variation associated with autism (Q3): (1) Genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex; (2) Adult cortical gene co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex; (3) Fetal cortical gene co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex; (4) Genes enriched for rare, de novo loss of function mutations in autism; and (5) Common genetic variants associated with autism. To assess the replicability of the findings, we validate the results using two independent datasets from ABIDE-II (Table 1). In parallel, we also used a second list of genes dysregulated in autism identified using a partially overlapping cortical gene expression data set of autism and control post-mortem brain samples to validate the enrichment analysis across all datasets.

Heterogeneity in autism neuroimaging studies is well documented and complex [13, 47], but it should be emphasized that the present analysis focuses on the relation between whole-brain variation in ΔCT and whole-brain variation in gene expression, thus a lack of spatial overlap in ΔCT does not affect the ΔCT—Gene relation."

This identified several genes that have been implicated in autism, synaptic processes and neural development. For example, one of the genes identified is SCN1A, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel, is one of the genes identified to be frequently mutated in autism [48–50]. SLIT1 and SLIT3 are important for regulating midline axon crossing in the developing forebrain [51]. Focusing on just the top 1% in the two validation datasets, given their high correlation, we identified several other genes that have been implicated in autism and synaptic transmission including GABRA3, GABRA5 and GABRB1, all of which encode subunits of the GABA receptor. Mutations in PTCHD1, another gene identified in the top 1%, have been implicated in autism and intellectual disabilities and contributes to dysfunction of excitatory synapses [52]. SYN2 and SYT17 encode synapsin2 and synatotagmin17 respectively, which are present in the presynaptic terminal and regulate neurotransmitter release." "nature_publishing_group_uk"

"691" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Here we report the association of transcriptionally downregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex with global differences in CT in 166 children with autism and 295 neurotypical children. Using partial least squares regression on a discovery dataset of 62 cases and 87 controls, we identify one component (PLSR1) that explains a significant proportion of variance in ΔCT and is enriched for the GO term ‘Synaptic Transmission’ and for neuronal genes. This component was enriched for genes downregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex and validated using two independent datasets. We also find that PLSR1 genes are enriched for fetal and adult developmental cortical modules that have been previously reported to be enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes in the post-mortem autism cortex and for genes involved in synaptic transmission [28, 31]. We were unable to identify genes associated with ΔCT in ADHD, another childhood condition. Our study provides robust evidence linking disease-related variance in CT to synaptic genes and dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex, linking molecular and macroscopic pathology."

"692" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Validation using two independent autism MRI datasets suggests that the results are valid even using MRI data from different cohorts that had different scanner settings. The results were valid despite non-significant correlations in global ΔCT between the discovery and the two validation datasets and sex did not contribute to any of the observed differences between datasets (see Supplementary material). This suggests that the same sets of genes are associated with ΔCT regardless of sex. Studies have identified differences in cortical morphology between neurotypical males and females and between males and females with autism [2, 53]. Here we identified a high correlation between a males-only dataset and two males and females combined MRI datasets for the gene weights and gene scores in the first PLS component." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"693" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Changes in CT may be due to a host of factors such as changes in myelination, synaptic pruning and dendritic arborisation. Evidence from rare genetic variants [54, 55] and transcriptionally dysregulated genes in autism have highlighted a role for synaptic transmission in the aetiology of autism [28, 29]. Transcriptional dysregulation may reflect either a causative risk mechanism for autism, or a compensatory consequence of genetic, hormonal and environmental risk for autism. Here, we are unable to disentangle if transcriptionally dysregulated genes causally contribute to cortical morphology changes, or if they are both downstream of a common risk mechanism, or both. It is possible that both CT variability and transcriptional dysregulation are downstream processes of genetic variation implicated in autism, and, as such the enrichment for transcriptionally dysregulated genes need not be causative of cortical morphological changes." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"694" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "We did not identify enrichments for rare, de novo loss of function genes or common variants implicated in autism. The lack of enrichment with rare, de novo loss of function genes may be due to both the relative low frequencies of such variants and small proportion of variance in liability explained by rare de novo variants [20]. In contrast, the lack of enrichment with common variants may be explained by the lack of statistical power of the largest available autism GWAS dataset. Indeed, there is no enrichment for common genetic variants associated with autism in co-expression modules enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes in autism [28]. In contrast, common variants for schizophrenia are enriched in co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in schizophrenia [56]. It is likely that larger samples will better reveal the role of common genetic variants in cortical morphology differences in autism. While we do not know the genetic make-up of the cases and controls, our results likely represent common downstream convergence of upstream genetic perturbations." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"695" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Animal studies have shown that several candidate genes for autism risk are regulated by synaptic activity, leading to the hypothesis that dysregulation in synaptic homeostasis is a major risk for autism [55]. The effects of this can contribute to both neural signal processing, and to more morphological changes in neuroanatomy via processes such as activity dependent synaptic pruning and dendritic arborization. Post-mortem studies of the brains of children and adolescents with autism have identified deficits in synaptic pruning [57]. Investigating the specific role of synaptic genes in altering neural circuitry and cortical morphology will help elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CT differences seen in autism." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"696" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "There are some caveats that need to be taken into consideration while interpreting these results. Gene expression data was derived from only six post-mortem adult brain samples. Gene expression is known to vary with age [58, 59]. Unfortunately, we are restricted in using the adult gene expression data from the AIBS for several reasons. First, this is the most spatially detailed dataset of gene expression. Second, the availability of MNI coordinates in the adult gene expression datasets allows for mapping of gene expression in distinct brain regions to CT differences extracted from MRI scans. Third, gene expression changes with age are limited and restricted to specific brain regions. A recent study identified only 9 genes significantly altered globally across the 10 regions investigated in post-mortem tissue samples [60], largely driven by glial genes. Cell specific enrichment in our dataset implicated neuronal genes only. Fourth, as autism is a developmental condition, investigating differences in cortical morphology at an early age is important to limit the role of environmental factors that contribute to differences in cortical morphology later in life [8, 61]. Fifth, enrichment for gene expression modules associated with autism risk in the developing cortex provides further confidence that the genes identified here are relevant across the age-spectrum. We do acknowledge that investigating a paediatric specific gene-expression dataset will help further refine the analyses, once this data becomes available." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"697" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "Lastly, the present study used CT in contrast to other morphological features such as cortical volume. It is known that grey matter volume relies on the relationship between two different morphometric parameters, CT and surface area that are unrelated genetically [62] and associated with different developmental trajectories1 [63]. The combination of at least two different sources of genetic and maturational influences on cortical volume would complicate meaningful analysis of associated genetic weights." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"698" "10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7" "To our knowledge, this is the first study linking different genetic risk mechanisms in autism with changes in cortical morphology. In sum, we have shown that genes that are enriched for synaptic transmission and downregulated in individuals with autism are significantly associated with global changes in CT. We also show that these genes are generally overexpressed in association cortices. We validated the results in multiple independent datasets but not in a matched MRI dataset that included individuals with ADHD, showing both replicability as well as selectivity."

"703" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "Depression and other mood disorders are common in all populations [1], and a quarter of all cases emerge before 20 years of age [2,3]. Most current treatments for depression involve medication that affects the brain monoamine systems [4], however heterogeneity in clinical presentation and variability in treatment response suggest additional mechanisms are present. There is now ever increasing evidence for an association between depression and inflammation [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. CRP has been used most extensively as a measure of low-grade systemic inflammation in psychiatric [11,13,14] and physical conditions [15,16]. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies demonstrate that levels of CRP and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, are elevated in acute depression [7,[17], [18], [19]]. Similarly, longitudinal studies suggest that increased levels of inflammatory markers in childhood/adolescence are associated with increased risks of depression and psychosis subsequently in adulthood [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Using prospective birth-cohort data, we reported that higher levels of IL-6 in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression subsequently in early adulthood in a dose-dependent manner [22]. We also reported that higher IL-6 levels in childhood are associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms between the ages of 10 and 19 years [25]. Other studies have also found a longitudinal association between circulating IL-6 and CRP levels and risk of depression at follow-up [20,26]. Findings from longitudinal studies of childhood inflammatory markers suggest that inflammation precedes depression, so it could be a cause for depression rather than simply be a consequence of illness." "w.b._saunders"
"704" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "A feature of most existing epidemiological studies of depression is that they used a one-off measure of CRP to gauge inflammation. There is some evidence that CRP and IL-6 levels remain relatively stable over time [27,28], and studies have often excluded participants with suspected infection [22,29]. Nevertheless, repeated measures within individuals over time allow to detect the level and longitudinal pattern of inflammation more accurately. To our knowledge, not many studies have examined the association between depression and longitudinal pattern of inflammation during childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. We are aware of one population-based longitudinal study that measured CRP five times between age 9 and 21 years [30]. Despite repeated measures, CRP data from only one assessment was used as predictor, reporting no association with depression in adulthood." "w.b._saunders"

Whether this recent CRP elevation could be a mediating factor for links between depression and past psychological stress, abuse/maltreatment is an important hypothesis that needs to be tested in further prospective samples."

"728" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "Our findings add to increasing evidence supporting a link between the immune system, particularly low-grade systemic inflammation defined by elevated concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers, and depression and other major mental disorders [6,48,49]. CRP is an acute phase protein which has been studied extensively in depression and shown to be elevated in acutely unwell patients compared with controls in several meta-analyses [7,18,19]. Compounding cross-sectional evidence, recently longitudinal studies have shown that elevated cytokine levels precede, and so could potentially cause, depressive symptoms: elevated IL-6 or CRP levels in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood [20,22,23,50]. We are now more confident than ever to suggest a causal role for inflammation in depression, as two recent studies have used Mendelian randomisation to further investigate the matter. In [51], the authors find that a genotype variant associated with decreased CRP levels is also associated with reduced odds of depression. In [52], the authors found that a poly-genic risk score for high CRP levels was significantly associated with increases in the risk of depression. These studies suggest that, if the genes linked with high CRP are linked with an increase in the risk of depression, it is unlikely that this association is only due to a true causal link rather than reverse causation or confounding. This study adds to the existing evidence by showing that increasing CRP levels between adolescence and young-adulthood are associated with a subsequent ICD-10 diagnosis of moderate/severe depression in young-adulthood at age 18 years. This finding fits nicely with a causal role of high CRP in depression, as it means that depression is most likely to manifest when CRP levels rise close to the index time of examination."

"729" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "Based on repeat measure of CRP we report that individuals with increasing levels of inflammation over time, especially during adolescence, have higher risk of moderate/severe depression in early-adulthood. In this study we did not examine potential reasons for the increases in CRP levels during adolescence, but this is likely to include both genetic and environmental factors. Adolescence is a time of profound physical and psychological transformation. This is also a stressful time for many individuals due to, for instance, forming new relationships, peer pressure, bullying. Increasing independence and experimentation during this developmental epoch is also associated with fast-food consumption, smoking, drinking, substance use - all of these factors could increase levels of inflammation. In future, studies are required to test why a sub-group of adolescents experience a sharp increase in their level of inflammation." "w.b._saunders"
"730" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "The use of a general population birth cohort, a relatively large sample, and particularly repeated prospective assessment of an inflammatory marker are some of the strengths of this study. The exclusion of participants with CRP levels of >10 mg/l at any point minimised potential confounding by chronic inflammatory conditions or current infection. In addition, we adjusted regression models for maternal education (a marker of socio-economic status), sex and BMI, which are linked with inflammation levels." "w.b._saunders"
"731" "10.1016/j.comppsych.2019.152143" "A key limitation is missing data. Of 14,062 live births in ALSPAC, 1627 cohort members provided serum CRP levels at all time points of 9, 15 and 18 years of age. Out of these, we excluded 66 participants who, at any point, had CRP levels >10 mg/l, and of these, 1462 participants took part in psychiatric assessment at age 18 years and were therefore included in this study. Thus, the group with CRP data at all three time points that formed the basis for our analysis may not be representative of all ALSPAC participants. Attrition in prospective cohort studies including ALSPAC is associated with lower socio-economic status and increased mental illness. Selective attrition of participants more likely to have the outcome of interest (depression) may have increased the possibility of null findings in our sample. Due to a limited sample size for repeat CRP data, we did not include additional confounders such as childhood trauma, smoking, poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and sleep disturbance, as this would have reduced the sample size further, leading to decreased statistical power."

In the central nervous system (CNS), COX-1 is constitutively expressed by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; COX-2 is expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala and is inducible in other cell types (1, 2). COX-2 and its products play important physiological role in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation but may also contribute to neuropathology by enhancing glutamate excitotoxicity, promoting neuronal cell death, and oxidizing endogenous cannabinoids (3, 4). Some studies suggest upregulation of COX-2 expression in inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases as well as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (1). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX enzymes either selectively or non-selectively. In rat models, selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib inhibit microglial activation (5) and glutamate release (6) and enhance serotonergic and noradrenergic output in the prefrontal cortex (7, 8). Meta-analyses suggest possible benefit of adjunctive COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) (9) and first-episode psychosis (10, 11); the general role of immunomodulation in these disorders has been recently reviewed (12)."

Other than a clinical trial protocol for celecoxib as an adjunct to vortioxetine in depression published in 2018 (13), their review of randomized controlled trials (RCT's) through November 2017 remains up to date 2 years later. In this commentary, we highlight three factors arising from their results that are essential to advancing this research agenda. First, there is a critical need to move beyond schema that use individual markers to characterize peripheral “pro-” and “anti-” inflammatory states, as well as M1/M2 microglial polarization. This model has the potential to vastly oversimplify the role of innate immunity in brain homeostasis and to limit biomarker discovery efforts. Second, COX inhibitors have direct and indirect effects on the functions of both neurons and glia. COX selectivity as well as COX-independent mechanisms of action vary among NSAIDs. More work is needed to determine which drugs of this class are the best candidates for adjunctive therapy targeting specific neuropsychiatric symptoms. Finally, childhood-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms represent important targets for early intervention with low-risk therapies, but there is little evidence to inform their use. Figure 1 outlines the potential role of COX signalling in psychiatric disorders and related research priorities." "frontiers"
"738" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Simplified schematic overview of COX activity in the central nervous system in psychiatric disorders. The inflammatory response may represent one mechanism by which environmental factors including psychosocial stress contribute to the development or perpetuation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with underlying genetic susceptibility. While typically inducible in other cell types, COX-2 is expressed constitutively at post-synaptic membranes by groups of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Release of prostanoids that act on pre-synaptic receptors may contribute to dysfunctional synaptic remodeling, altered calcium homeostasis, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuronal cell death. Research priorities are further described in the text." "frontiers"
"739" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "The identification of immune-related bio-signatures will ideally assist in predicting risk of disease, prognosis, and response to therapy (14). Sethi et al. describe elevated pro-inflammatory markers as “consistently associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms.” While promising studies have begun to identify subpopulations of patients with MDD likely to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy (15), results of immune phenotyping in other disorders have been variable. A recent systematic review found that meta-analyses for MDD, ASD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia have consistently reported changes in only 16, 7, 8, and 7 individual inflammation-related factors in peripheral blood, respectively (16). The single meta-analysis of immune phenotyping studies in OCD was filtered out because of insufficient statistical power (16). Longitudinal data were lacking and state versus trait markers difficult to distinguish, markers were restricted to a few per study based on a biased candidate gene/cytokine approach, and the contribution of confounding factors—including childhood adversity, diet, and smoking—was potentially significant (16). Ultimately, longitudinal clinical characterization combined with a broad approach to immune phenotyping—as employed in a recent analysis of microarray data in MDD (17)—is likely a higher-yield approach both for biomarker discovery and for improving our understanding of how peripheral inflammation reflects or perpetuates psychiatric symptoms." "frontiers"
"740" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Sethi et al. also provide a common yet limiting perspective on microglial activation states. The disadvantages of the M1/M2 conceptualization of macrophage (18) and microglial (19) polarity in vivo have been previously discussed. As an in vitro construct that relies on stimulating cultured cells with a defined set of factors (20), its application to in vivo conditions is generally limited (21). Moreover, so-called M1 and M2 gene signatures often coexist in complex mixed phenotypes; the dichotomous paradigm is not supported by transcriptional profiling of human macrophages or monocytes activated by diverse ligands (22). Emerging evidence suggests that microglial subtype categorization should consider both their environment-dependent plasticity and subtypes with inherent functional specificity (23). Technologies that can assist in these efforts include two-photon imaging, whole-genome transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses at the cellular level, mass cytometry, and high-content experimental models (19)." "frontiers"
"741" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Evidence for activation of microglia in patients with psychiatric disorders does not appear to be specific for any particular diagnostic category. Post-mortem characterization of microglia together with evaluation of translocator protein positron emission tomography imaging in patients with MDD suggest that the severity of illness—marked by limited response to traditional medications and increased suicidality—rather than the presence of the disorder itself is associated with altered microglial phenotypes (24, 25). This has led to the hypothesis that inflammation in the CNS primarily reflects psychological stress (26). COX inhibition may therefore be most effective for individuals with severe pathology of diverse etiologies, and when employed at the earliest clinical stage possible may alter the path toward chronic aberrant innate immune activity." "frontiers"
"742" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "While all NSAIDS have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties attributable to prostaglandin inhibition, they vary with respect to COX selectivity (27) and likely with respect to COX-independent mechanisms (28–30). In the CNS, modulation of glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endocannabinoid signaling has been demonstrated for COX-2 inhibitors, while the role of non-selective NSAIDs in neurotransmitter function is less clear (3, 4, 6–8). NSAID use has also been associated with distinct gut microbial populations (31), an additional mechanism by which this class of drugs could affect neural development, cognition, and behaviour (32)." "frontiers"
"743" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Few RCT's have evaluated non-selective NSAIDs in primary psychiatric disorders, although the literature includes a negative RCT of naproxen in geriatric depression (33) and a study of adjuvant aspirin in schizophrenia suggesting some benefit (34). Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) recommend the use of naproxen before celecoxib because of its “greater potency” (35), despite clinical studies showing benefit of adjunctive celecoxib in OCD (36, 37) and pre-clinical data demonstrating celecoxib-mediated enhancement of the serotonergic effects of fluoxetine in a rat model of anxiety (38). Moreover, observational studies have focused on NSAIDs as a class in children with PANS/PANDAS (39, 40). Given the significance of different COX isoforms and their unknown relative “potencies” in the CNS, careful attention must be given to selection and evaluation of specific NSAIDs." "frontiers"
"744" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "A recent Danish population-based study suggested that environmental factors related to infection and inflammation are associated with the development of multiple mental disorders in children (41), adding to growing support for the link between immune activity and psychiatric symptoms early in life. However, there is currently little evidence to inform the use of adjunctive anti-inflammatory agents in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Studies of peripheral inflammatory markers in this population have been equivocal, largely limited by similar methodological factors as adult studies (42, 43)." "frontiers"
"745" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Early-life stress is more clearly associated with overt inflammation prior to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. For example, childhood trauma is associated with significantly elevated peripheral levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (44, 45). Elevated IL-6 in childhood is in turn associated with increased risk of future depressive and psychotic symptoms in adolescence (46, 47). Stress-related epigenetic dysregulation in immune networks represents one mechanism by which childhood experiences may become biologically embedded (48), and a potential target for early intervention. Epigenetic modifications facilitate the phenotypic plasticity of macrophages, are critical to their role in maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and contribute to a form of innate immune “memory” that persists across the lifespan (49, 50)." "frontiers"
"746" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Randomized controlled trials of COX-2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapies in children with treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders with a potential immune-mediated component may be warranted, beyond the single study of celecoxib in ASD noted by Sethi et al. Reassuring safety data exist for both celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs, derived from studies of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (51) and familial adenomatous polyposis (52). This approach may be particularly relevant in OCD given that the majority of affected individuals experience disease onset in childhood or adolescence, with a persistence rate of approximately 40% (53). Clinical practice guidelines suggesting the use of celecoxib as a third-line agent in adults with OCD (54) and naproxen or celecoxib in children with PANS/PANDAS (35) provide a further clinical imperative for these studies." "frontiers"
"747" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that aberrant inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Altered immune homeostasis may represent the consequence of exposure to environmental factors including psychosocial stress together with cumulative genetic and epigenetic risk. Changes in neuroendocrine regulation, metabolism, gut microbiota, and health behaviours in turn affect peripheral and central immune cell phenotypes. For individuals with the most severe symptoms refractory to traditional treatments, modulation of the innate immune system with COX-2 inhibitors appears to be an attractive—though understudied—therapeutic approach." "frontiers"
"748" "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00264" "In characterizing state and trait markers of disease and identifying appropriate patients for anti-inflammatory treatments, broad immunophenotyping is likely to be essential. Moreover, preclinical studies suggesting effects of COX-2 inhibition on neurotransmitter function would suggest that traditional markers of inflammation in the periphery may not be required for therapeutic effect. The implications of differences in COX selectivity as well as COX-independent effects of individual NSAIDs in the CNS require further study. Finally, stressful events in childhood drive peripheral inflammation and affect neurodevelopment. Given our increasing understanding of innate immune memory and its potential role in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, the likely bidirectional relationship between inflammation and psychiatric symptoms, and the known benefits of early intervention, treatment trials of COX-2 inhibitors in carefully-selected pediatric populations are warranted."

Infliximab, an anti-TNF-α antibody, was not effective for depressive symptoms in subjects with treatment-resistant MDD; but post hoc analysis indicated that the subgroup of patients with high CRP was more responsive [15]. A small molecule inhibitor of P38 MAP kinase was not consistently effective in two studies of MDD [16]. However, there was evidence of a moderate-sized anti-inflammatory drug effect (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI [0.11–0.57]) on depressive symptoms in a meta-analysis of clinical trial data on NSAIDs and anti-cytokine antibodies in patients with a primary diagnosis of depression or inflammatory disorder [17], and in a meta-analysis of anti-cytokine antibody effects on depressive symptoms in inflammatory disorders (SMD = 0.44; 95% CI [0.22–0.59]) [4, 18–21]."

Anti-inflammatory drug effects on psychological symptoms may arise secondarily to treatment effects on the physical signs and symptoms of inflammatory disorders. Alternatively, the antidepressant efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs may reflect a direct, mechanistically related effect of treatment. This hypothetical dilemma remains unresolved [17, 18]."

Access to patient-level data (N = 10,743) enabled us to identify the cohort of trial participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline, to focus on improvement in the DSM 5 cardinal depressive symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia, and to control for physical health outcomes (although high depressive patients were not randomly allocated to treatment groups in the primary studies). We analyzed 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials, sponsored by Janssen or GlaxoSmithKline, of 9 compounds targeting 7 mechanisms of action (TNF-α, IL-12/23, IL-6, CD20, COX2, BLγS, and P38/MAPK14) in patients with a primary diagnosis of one of 9 inflammatory or oncological disorders (see Table 1).Table 1Characteristics of clinical trials included in the mega-analysis.

The SF-36 comprises 36 self-report measures of physical and mental health that can be summarized by 8 domain scores and two component scores (physical and mental health). We used the mental health component score and the vitality domain score as standard SF-36 outcomes. Additionally, to focus on depressive symptoms, we constructed a depressive symptom summary score (range, 0–100). This was based on the two SF-36 questions (“Have you felt downhearted and depressed?” and “Have you felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer you up?”) that most closely corresponded to core DSM-5 symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia; see Supplementary Information. In one study (C0743T09), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS [23]) was used instead of the SF-36. In an independent study where both scales were measured, the HADS-D was significantly correlated with the defined SF-36 depressive symptom score (Spearman r = 0.63, p < 0.0001)."

In C0743T09, patients were classified as high depressive if baseline total HADS score was ≥8 [23].

Separate models were fit for patients in high and low depressive symptom strata. Depressive symptom score was the primary dependent variable.

"779" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "Our principal findings are that depressive symptoms are frequent among patients recruited to clinical trials for non-psychiatric inflammatory disorders and that immunomodulatory drug treatment generally causes a modest, but significant, improvement in depressive symptoms, specifically in the subgroups of patients with high depressive symptoms at baseline (SMD = 0.29; 95% CI. 0.12–0.45). These results are compatible with prior data implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology and response to treatment of depression [1, 2, 25, 26]. This modest effect size is comparable to meta-analytic estimates of antidepressant efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with major depressive disorder [27], and comparable to the standardized effect sizes seen in meta-analyses of inflammatory cytokines in case-control cohorts [1, 4, 6, 28]." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"780" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "In evaluating these results, it is reasonable to ask how much of the improvement in mental health is attributable to treatment benefits for the primary disease states evaluated in these trials. When we controlled statistically for treatment effects on physical health, the mega-analytic estimate of antidepressant effect size was reduced (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06–0.35) but remained significant. Likewise, anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF antibodies had significant beneficial effects on core depressive symptoms, even in patients who had not responded to treatment in terms of improved physical health for the primary disease states studied. In contrast, broader measures of mental health or vitality, which included questions probing somatic symptoms, such as fatigue, were less robust to statistical correction for physical health outcomes. We conclude that the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on depressive symptoms are not entirely attributable to their effects on physical health. However, it may be that somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue) are more strongly coupled to peripheral tissue disease activity than psychological symptoms (e.g., anhedonia). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that conventional assessments of primary disease severity sometimes included a biomarker index of inflammation (e.g., the DAS28-CRP index used to assess rheumatoid arthritis severity includes CRP). Adjusting antidepressant effects of treatment by DAS28-CRP scores may correct for not only physical health effects of treatment but may also attenuate the effect size of any treatment on depressive symptoms or fatigue that are mediated by inflammatory mechanisms."

"781" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "The antidepressant effect size varied between different classes of drug target. Antibodies targeting IL-6 or IL-12 and IL-23 (IL-12/23) had large and statistically significant effect sizes on core depressive symptoms before correction for physical health outcomes. Moreover, the antidepressant effect of ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23 antibody) remained significant after correction for physical health outcome, and the effect of sirukumab and siltuximab (anti-IL-6 antibodies) remained significant in non-responders for the primary disease states evaluated. A variety of evidence implicates IL-6 in the pathogenesis of depression [9, 29, 30], and a phase 2 trial of sirukumab for patients with MDD and CRP >3 mg/L has recently completed (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02473289). Increased levels of IL-12 in depressed patients were reduced by monoaminergic antidepressant treatment [31, 32]. Antibodies targeting BLγS and TNF-α also demonstrated trend-level efficacy for depressive symptoms. Small molecules targeting P38MAPK or COX2 demonstrated the least antidepressant effect which is compatible with the lack of compelling evidence for antidepressant efficacy of these mechanisms in previously published MDD trials [16]."

"782" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "The main strength of this study is that we have reported depressive symptom outcomes in 1921 patients treated with one of a range of mechanistically selective and innovative drugs in randomized clinical trials. Access to patient-level data enabled post hoc patient stratification and statistical controls for physical health outcomes, which is not possible in literature-based meta-analyses. The main limitations are related to the fact that the primary studies were not prospectively designed to test drug effects on depressive or other psychological states. For example, depressive symptoms were usually assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. This PRO measure has the merit of being widely used, allowing consistent evaluation of treatment effects across a large number of studies and participants; however, it was not intended to serve as an endpoint for antidepressant efficacy. It is noteworthy, nonetheless, that the depressive symptom score derived from the SF-36 is significantly correlated with HADS-D scores. Similarly, the vitality domain score of the SF-36 includes questions related to fatigue but it is not designed to test efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in treating symptoms of fatigue."

"783" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "A related issue is that the studies were focused on a diverse range of primary disorders. The comparisons between different anti-inflammatory drug effects on depression were not controlled by design for type or severity of physical comorbidity, although we endeavored to mitigate this issue by including physical health measures as covariates in the analysis of depressive symptom scores. The primary studies also varied in terms of the “standard of care” provided to patients in both placebo and active treatment groups. In particular, studies differed in terms of allowed concomitant medications and the percentage of patients using corticosteroids. In each study, however, patients in both the placebo and active treatment groups were subject to the same standard of care, so this potential between-study difference appeared unlikely to bias within-study estimation of treatment effects; furthermore, a post hoc analysis found no significant effect of corticosteroid use on between-study variation in treatment effect size (Supplementary Table 2). Likewise, in each study, patients were well-matched for age, sex, and BMI between treatment groups, suggesting that these factors are unlikely to bias estimation of within-study antidepressant effects. We further evaluated the effect of between-study variability in age, sex, and BMI and found only a small age effect indicating that older subjects are less responsive (Supplementary Fig. 2). We were unable to rigorously assess dose-response relationships, because most studies used more than one dose of active treatment, but not always the same dose range in different studies of the same drug, and data on dose/occupancy relationships were not available for all drugs. Finally, patients with high depressive symptoms were not randomly allocated to treatment in any of the studies, which fundamentally constrains causal interpretation of treatment effects in this subgroup of treated patients."

"784" "10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8" "Collectively the limitations of our study highlight the need for future studies designed primarily to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on validated efficacy endpoints for depression and fatigue. Future studies also are needed to explore whether inflammatory biomarkers at baseline can identify subgroups of MDD patients likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Greater use of predictive biomarkers may also be important in managing safety risks by precluding treatment of patients unlikely to respond, We note that antidepressants include a black box warning indicating they may increase the risk of suicidal thinking in children and adolescents, and that recently the IL-17 inhibitor brodalumab was approved as a treatment for psoriasis with a warning that it has been linked to suicidal ideation [32]. In future trials of immunomodulatory drugs for inflammatory disorders associated with high levels of mental health comorbidity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it would be useful to measure outcomes early and frequently to test whether direct effects of treatment on mental health can be demonstrated before treatment effects on physical health are evident."

Emerging work has shown that events starting during prenatal development can have long-term impact potentially leading to increased likelihood for atypical neurodevelopmental phenotypes. For instance, neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism have been linked to multiple types of biological processes that stem from very early periods of prenatal development [4–10]. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly clear that prenatal brain development is a critical window of importance for understanding factors that increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"789" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "Several early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorders, conduct disorder) are well known to have a sex-biased prevalence rate [11]. For example, the latest estimates for autism suggest that three males are diagnosed for every one female [12]. Several theories have been put forward to explain the sex ratio imbalance in early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions [13], over and above under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis in females [14]. One prominent theory suggests that there are factors inherent in females that act to reduce the likelihood of atypical neurodevelopment [15]. For example, a higher burden of large effect mutations are present in females compared to males with autism, suggesting that protective mechanisms in females may raise the threshold for deleterious impact of such mutations [16]. In contrast to female-specific factors reducing likelihood of autism, there may also be important male-specific mechanisms for increasing the likelihood of developing autism. We have theorized that sex steroid hormones such as testosterone may have fetal programming effects on later brain development in ways relevant to autism [17]. Recent large studies have confirmed that maternal polycystic ovary syndrome, a syndrome associated with elevated androgen levels, increases the odds for both autism and ADHD in offspring [18–20]. We also recently confirmed elevation of a latent steroidogenic factor affecting multiple steroid hormones including testosterone in the amniotic fluid of clinically diagnosed males with autism [7]. Extending into the non-clinical population, continuous variation in how much fetal testosterone (FT) an individual is exposed to in the womb is associated with behavioral variation in autistic traits [21, 22]. FT and later postnatal testosterone variation also affects specific behavioral and cognitive domains such as social cognition, language, emotion, and reward processes, which are implicated in autism and other male-biased neurodevelopmental conditions [23–25]. Thus, it may be that multiple sex-specific factors could be at work to both increase likelihood in males and decrease likelihood in females for developing early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions. Further work is needed to tease apart how these mechanisms may operate similarly or differently in males and females. In addition, translational work is needed to examine how such mechanisms directly affect biological processes supporting both typical and atypical human brain development."

"790" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "In this study, we first examine the question of whether FT longitudinally exerts sex-specific influence over intrinsic functional organization of specific circuits involved in social, language, and affective functions in humans. To test this question, we examined a unique cohort of individuals in whom we have measured concentration levels of testosterone directly from amniotic fluid during a midgestational window of pregnancy where fetuses are sexually differentiating and where surges in sex steroid levels may have maximal impact on early brain development [26, 27]. These individuals are now in their adolescent years and we examined how variability in FT is associated with patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity as measured with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Given known links between FT and the behavioral and cognitive domains of social cognition, social-communication, language, emotion, and reward [23, 24], we examined specific neural circuits known for their roles in these domains. We predicted that FT would act as a male-specific mechanism to influence connectivity towards atypicality and that such male-specific influence would not be observed in females."

"791" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "While it is important to identify associations between FT and macroscale neural circuitry, we also want to better understand how androgens like testosterone exert mechanistic influence over early prenatal neural development. Testosterone can exert gene regulatory influence through several routes. Testosterone or conversion via 5-alpha-reductase to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) could potentially act in a direct manner via the androgen receptor (AR) to influence transcription of other genes targeted by the AR. However, testosterone can also be converted to estradiol via aromatase and have different transcriptional influence over genes targeted by the estrogen receptor (ER). To understand how testosterone may have AR-dependent influence on early neural development we further examined how DHT affects gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC) [28]. Of particular interest for this work is the overlap between DHT-dysregulated genes and genes spatially expressed in similar patterns across cortex as rsfMRI-defined macroscale networks that are associated with FT. If FT influences later neural circuitry in an AR-dependent manner, we expect that the DHT-dysregulated gene set would be enriched for genes that are spatially expressed in patterns that highly resemble FT-associated rsfMRI networks."

At amniocentesis, none of the individuals screened positive for any chromosomal abnormalities and were thus considered typically developing. At the time of scanning, none of the participants self- or parent-reported any kind of neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.

On average, connectivity between these components is robustly non-zero indicating strong normative relationships between these two integral parts of the DMN.

However, we did not find any evidence of a relationship between FT and DMN connectivity that spans across the sexes (r = −0.20, p = 0.15; Supplementary Fig. 1). Because all subjects were adolescents, current levels of testosterone could play a potential mediating role in the relationship between FT and DMN connectivity.

Upregulated genes are enriched in numerous processes spanning angiogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis and development, enzyme linked receptor protein signaling, cell surface receptor signaling, signal transduction, cell morphogenesis, neuron development, and cell differentiation, among many others. Downregulated genes are enriched in cardiac chamber morphogenesis, regionalization, pattern specification process, neuron differentiation, neurogenesis, among many others (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). We previously reported enrichments with many autism-associated genes, which are also known as syndromic causes of autism [28]. Although our DE analyses differed from the past paper [28], the current enrichment analyses largely confirm this prior finding. Many genes listed in the ‘‘Syndromic’’ category of SFARI Gene were also DHT-dysregulated (e.g., HI1, ASXL3, CHD2, DHCR7, HCN1, MEF2C, PAX6, PRODH, PTEN, and SCN1A). Other important autism-associated genes were also DHT-dysregulated such as NLGN4X, NRXN3, FOXP1, and SCN9A. For more on this enrichment analysis between DHT-dysregulated genes and autism-associated genes for this analysis, see the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Fig. 4C."

"810" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "We then tested the critical question regarding whether any genes influenced by DHT in hNSCs are relevant for developing cortical networks such as the DMN, which are influenced by FT in a sex-specific manner. We used Neurosynth Gene Expression Decoding analyses to isolate spatial gene expression patterns that are similar to the DMN components identified by rsfMRI. While only four genes pass at FDR q < 0.05 for the IC09 component, 2444 genes pass at the same FDR threshold for the IC01 component. This IC01 gene set was significantly enriched in genes that are differentially expressed by DHT in hNSCs (OR = 1.88, p = 0.000002). This overlapping gene set was highly enriched in a number of synaptic processes (Fig. 2a). Several examples of such genes are shown in Fig. 2b–f—particularly myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), synaptotagmin 17 (SYT17), neurabin-1 (PPP1R9A), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), glutamate receptor 1 (GRIA1), and glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate 2 (GRIK2), sodium channel, voltage gated, type III alpha subunit (SCN3A), and sodium channel, voltage gated, type IX alpha subunit (SCN9A).Fig. 2Synaptic enrichments of DHT-dysregulated genes and genes with high levels of spatially expression similarity to rsfMRI DMN IC01 map (a) and plots of specific genes contributing to these enrichments (b–h).

MEF2C is among the genes from SFARI Gene noted as a syndromic cause of autism and is differentially expressed here by DHT. MEF2C is also known to be a downstream target of the androgen receptor [45]. While MEF2C itself is not sex-differentially expressed in the brain during prenatal and adult periods of development [46, 47], as a transcription factor it can differentially target other genes as a function of sex and the degree of such sex-differential targeting explains a substantial amount of variance in sex-differential expression [48]. Confirming DHT upregulation of MEF2C expression we ran a follow-up experiment using qPCR and found that indeed the upregulation of MEF2C by DHT in the RNA-seq data is replicated using qPCR on three additional independent cell lines (t = 3.73, p = 0.003, replication Bayes Factor = 164) (Fig. 3b, c).Fig. 3a Shows spatial pattern of MEF2C expression compared to spatial rsfMRI map for IC01.

Using the Allen Institute BrainSpan Developmental Gene Expression atlas we indeed find that prenatal development is a prominent period where MEF2C is upregulated in medial prefrontal cortex (p = 0.01). There is also enhanced variability in prenatal MEF2C expression compared to postnatal expression (p = 0.02)—an effect likely due to marked change from first to second and third trimesters of gestation. MEF2C expression increases substantially from first to second trimester of gestation and continues high levels of expression until around 2 years of age, when expression tapers off and becomes stable throughout the rest of the lifespan (Fig. 3d)." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"815" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "Finally, we tested whether MEF2C is dysregulated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from male patients with autism and whether the directionality of such dysregulation is congruent with the directionality of DHT-influence on MEF2C expression. To achieve this aim, we re-examined a recent RNA-seq dataset, which examined iPSC, neural progenitor cells, and neurons grown from fibroblasts of male cases of autism [10]. An ANOVA examining all cell types identified a Diagnosis⁎Cell Type interaction (F = 6.89, p = 0.0047). Congruent with the directionality of DHT upregulation, MEF2C is also upregulated in iPSCs from male patients with autism (t = 3.68, p = 0.0035, Cohen’s d = 1.42). In contrast, no dysregulation is observed in neural progenitor cells (t = 0.12, p = 0.90, Cohen’s d = 0.11) or neurons in autism (t = 2.19, p = 0.052, Cohen’s d = 1.31) (Fig. 3e)."

"816" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "In this study, we have shown that variation in testosterone during midgestational prenatal development has long-lasting effects on how specific networks comprising the core of the social brain, the DMN, are organized. In line with hypotheses about sex-specific mechanisms, we identified that the fetal programming impact of testosterone on later circuit-level organization of the DMN depends on whether an individual is male or female. These findings are compatible with other normative large-scale work on sex differences in DMN connectivity. Two large independent studies on adults utilizing the 1000 Functional Connectomes or UK Biobank datasets now replicably show that default mode connectivity is subtly on-average stronger in females than in males [49, 50]. While these prior and much larger studies find these subtle DMN sex differences, it is noteworthy that sex differences in DMN connectivity were not apparent in the current dataset (t = 0.23, p = 0.81; Supplementary Fig. 5). This result is most likely due to lack of statistical power for identifying the subtle sex differences that prior and much larger studies have identified. Nevertheless, the directionality of documented on-average DMN sex differences in functional connectivity are congruent with the directionality of the male-specific influence shown here—FT reduces later DMN connectivity, and thus could be one explanation behind the on-average lower DMN connectivity in males observed in other studies [49, 50]." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"817" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "These findings are also particularly relevant for understanding how the prenatal environmental shapes early neurobiological mechanisms and heightens male-susceptibility for early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions. Autism is an early neurodevelopmental condition of particular relevance here, given the 3:1 sex ratio [12] alongside other work implicating elevated prenatal steroidogenic activity [7, 18]. The hallmark features of autism are profound difficulties with early social-communication and social behavior, which has led to many investigations on the possible link with default mode network organization and function. The two core DMN subsystems identified in this work are known for the importance in both mentalizing and self-referential cognition and these domains along with the DMN circuitry underlying them are known to be atypical in males with autism [51–54]. The current results suggest that FT could act as a male-specific mechanism that reduces connectivity between core default mode subsystems linked to domains that are highly important for social-communication." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"818" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "Showing that FT influences later functional organization within the human brain is the first step in understanding the developmental biology behind this effect. Imperative in working towards this translational goal is the need to understand how FT might have male-specific biological effects on developing neural circuits for the social brain, such as the DMN. Using a human neural stem cell model, we identified a subset of genes that are differentially expressed after androgen treatment. In an important link to autism, this set of genes is enriched in a number of high-impact genes known to be causes of syndromic autism and intellectual disability. This finding underscores a prior paper [28] utilizing the same dataset that came across similar findings albeit with a different approach for differential expression analysis. However, this finding makes some specific inferences with regards to enrichments with the ‘‘syndromic’’ category of variants (n = 102) labeled within SFARI Gene, whereas the prior paper looked for enrichment with any of n = 235 genes annotated within SFARI Gene." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"819" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "In keeping with the relevant early phase of neurodevelopment for hNSCs, the DHT manipulation affected many genes involved in important neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis, cell differentiation, pattern specification and regionalization, and morphogenesis. These findings are also in line with previous work [28] whereby independent experiments showed that DHT enhances cell proliferation and prevents cell death during neuronal differentiation under nutrient-deprived conditions. These processes are hypothesized to be some of the earliest key prenatal processes that are affected in autism and dysregulation of these processes can have multifinal outcomes and pleiotropic effects later in life including atypical circuit formation and function [55]. Androgen activity can be considered as a gene regulatory influence over prenatal brain development given that such sex hormones work via androgen receptor signaling to directly affect transcription of many other genes. This work further supports the idea that androgens can exert regulatory impact over prenatal neurobiological processes that are highly linked to male-biased conditions like autism." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"820" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "Going beyond the list of DHT-dysregulated genes, we went further to pinpoint a subset of DHT-influenced genes that are also highly relevant specifically for the cortical midline DMN subsystem that shows a male-specific influence of FT. This subset of DHT-dysregulated and cortical midline DMN-relevant genes was enriched for a variety of synaptic processes and potentially highlights important biological mechanisms in prenatal development that androgens act on. For example, the top enrichment in such genes was for excitatory postsynaptic potentials and includes genes for glutamate receptors such as GRIK2, GRIA1, and GRIA2, all of which are upregulated by DHT. Also included in this enrichment is MEF2C, which is upregulated by DHT, and is known to alter excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance [56, 57]. Also relevant to E-I imbalance is NPTX2, which has effects on GluA4-containing AMPA receptors [58] and synaptogenesis [59]. DHT also upregulates sodium-gated ion channel genes (SCN3A, SCN9A), which have spatial similarity expression with cortical midline DMN and could also be relevant to E-I imbalance. All of these effects whereby DHT upregulates expression of such genes may point to the importance of E-I imbalance in androgen-impact on early prenatal brain development. This is particularly relevant to autism given common theoretical views about E-I imbalance in autism [60]. Because these genes are highly expressed in spatial patterns resembling the DMN network we find associated with FT in rsfMRI, it may be that these are key mechanisms of prenatal androgen-impact on early developing social brain DMN circuit formation and maintenance." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"821" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "While there are many genes from this work that could be focused on, we particularly highlight the role of MEF2C. Ample evidence supports the involvement of MEF2C as a candidate mechanism involved in male-biased early developmental conditions such as autism and intellectual disability [4, 57, 61–64]. Developmentally, MEF2C is highly expressed during prenatal development (Fig. 3d). Within prenatal development MEF2C has the potential to be a transcriptional regulator of a number of autism-associated genes— MEF2C binding motifs are enriched in upstream regions of genes within prenatal gene co-expression modules that harbor a number of autism-associated genes [4]. Congruent with the idea that MEF2C is important for many prenatal neurodevelopmental processes, other work has shown it is involved in neurogenesis, cell differentiation, maturation, and migration [65–67] as well as having later roles to play in experience-dependent synaptic development and cell death [56, 57, 68, 69]. MEF2C is also a known downstream target of the androgen receptor (AR), thus making it highly susceptible to androgen-dependent transcriptional influence [45]. MEF2C is also one of the most important transcription factor genes influencing sex differences in human brain gene expression—MEF2C differentially targets genes as a function of sex, and the magnitude of this sex-differential targeting explains a large percentage of variance in sex differences in gene expression of its putative targets [48]. Our work further underscores MEF2C’s involvement in male-specific mechanisms behind atypical neurodevelopment, and particularly highlights how MEF2C could be one of many candidates behind fetal programming effects of androgens on developing social brain circuits such as the DMN. Compatible with effects on early neurogenesis and differentiation, we find evidence that MEF2C expression is dysregulated in the same direction as FT influence in iPS cells in male cases with autism. Thus, important future work could examine AR targeting of MEF2C and its effect on early neurogenesis and differentiation processes. Finally, while available data suggests that rare deleterious MEF2C mutations are not more prevalent in males vs. females with autism or intellectual disability [70–72], it is unclear whether sex effects would exist in more subtle missense mutations or whether effects might appear with much larger sample size. It will be important in future work to examine these questions with larger datasets." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"822" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "There are some important caveats and limitations to be discussed. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, it is noteworthy that FT exhibits a much larger range of variability in males than females. From the current data we cannot determine whether females might show a similar effect if FT variability was enhanced to a similar range as that of males. Thus, the interpretations must be tempered by the caveat that the current data cannot tell us whether the observed effects are due to a fundamental difference in the how males vs. females respond to FT or whether the effect is simply a matter of difference in how much FT males and females are exposed to. Further work examining females with a larger range of FT levels is needed to better understand the sex-specific effects of FT exposure on later development. Second, the current work on hNSCs primarily shows how testosterone may have important actions on early neural development via conversion to DHT and action on the androgen receptor. However, future work could examine other routes of influence, such as aromatization of testosterone to estradiol and actions through the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, prior work has shown that the gene RORA is influenced by androgens and estrogens and can have further regulatory influence over aromatase levels and act to reduce estrogen levels [73]. RORA and aromatase levels are both reduced in frontal cortex in autism and are highly related to each other [73, 74]. This work suggests that routes of influence via the AR may be more likely implicated in autism. Nonetheless, future work should investigate the role of testosterone conversion to estradiol and actions via the estrogen receptor and how such mechanisms interact with RORA in autism." "nature_publishing_group_uk"
"823" "10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y" "In conclusion, we find that variation in FT during midgestational periods of prenatal development has a sex-specific impact on later human brain development. In particular, FT reduces functional connectivity in adolescence between social brain DMN subsystems in males, but has no effect on DMN functional connectivity in females. This sex-specific influence in early prenatal development was modeled in hNSCs to discover how androgens may act as a transcriptional influence on genes that are highly relevant in the adult brain for specific DMN-related circuitry. Here, we discovered that DHT-dysregulated genes are enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and are highly enriched for genes that are spatially expressed in a similar pattern to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. These DHT-dysregulated and DMN-relevant genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a variety of synaptic processes and may affect excitation-inhibition balance. These affected processes are congruent with the idea that FT may exert fetal programming influence on genes that play roles in biological processes that are integral for later circuit formation and maintenance. DHT also plays a prominent role in dysregulating genes involved in many early neurodevelopmental processes such as neurogenesis, cell differentiation, patterning, and regionalization. This effect is compatible with the idea that androgens can affect genes that may have pleiotropic roles at early and later phases of brain development that link early cell proliferation and differentiation to later synaptic organization. MEF2C is one particular gene with such early and late developmental roles. MEF2C is also highly relevant to cortical midline DMN circuitry and is highly associated with male-biased conditions such as autism and intellectual disability. MEF2C is upregulated in hNSCs by DHT. In an important link with autism, we find similar MEF2C upregulation in iPS cells, but not neural progenitor cells or neurons from male cases of autism. This work highlights that prenatal androgens may have male-specific influence over early prenatal neurodevelopmental processes that can potentially manifest as long-lasting influence over social brain circuitry. These effects may help explain normative sex differences in brain and behavior as well as increased male-susceptibility to conditions such as autism." "nature_publishing_group_uk"

In a previous study, we reported a highly increased risk of common psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions, among cancer patients, especially during the first year after cancer diagnosis [5]. Underlying reasons for such increased risk may include a severe stress response after receiving cancer diagnosis [6–8] and psychiatric symptoms caused by cancer treatment [9, 10], pain [11], and inflammation [12, 13]. Inflammation in the tumor micro-environment drives tumor development and progression [14] and cancer patients have a high burden of cancer-induced systemic inflammation [15]." "biomed_central"
"826" "10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4" "Inflammation has been suggested to be involved in the development of depression [16] and other psychiatric disorders [17]. For instance, inflammatory cytokines have been shown to influence neurocircuitry in the brain through the consequence of neurotransmitter signaling [18], including a cascade of behavioral and immune responses that might lead to depression, anxiety [19], and PTSD [19, 20] among vulnerable individuals. Although the link between inflammation and psychiatric disorders has been less explored among patients with cancer, chronic inflammatory disorders have been reported to be risk factors for depression and anxiety among cancer patients [21]."

"827" "10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4" "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for pain and inflammation. The anti-inflammatory actions of NSAIDs include inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and prostaglandin synthesis [22]. Due to its non-competitive and irreversible acetylation of COX, aspirin is different from non-aspirin NSAIDs in terms of indications and adverse effects [23]. A recent meta-analysis of 26 relatively small randomized clinical trials suggested that NSAIDs play an antidepressant role in patients with major depressive disorder and are reasonably safe [24]. Preclinical studies indicate that the use of aspirin is associated with a lower risk of depression in the general population [25], and among patients with stroke [26] or osteoarthritis [27]. There is, however, a lack of evidence in this regard among cancer patients and on psychiatric disorders other than depression. Our recent preclinical study showed that low-dose aspirin might counteract the inflammation-related cognitive impairment in a mouse model of breast cancer [28]. It is therefore plausible that aspirin may help to prevent inflammation-related psychiatric disorders among cancer patients." "biomed_central"

We focused on the first year after cancer diagnosis because the risk of psychiatric disorders appears to be highest immediately after cancer diagnosis [5]. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had conflicting information (i.e., died or emigrated before cancer diagnosis) (n = 982), or were diagnosed at autopsy (n = 2336). Because we aimed at assessing the risk of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders, patients with preexisting depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorder before cancer diagnosis ascertained since 1973 onward according to the Patient Register [30] were also excluded (n = 17,787), leaving 316,904 patients in the final analysis (Fig. 1). We hypothesized the newly onset depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis might be more closely related to cancer-related inflammation and the psychological stress patients experienced after receiving a cancer diagnosis.

The information of daily dose was extracted from the prescription text, and a mean daily dose was calculated from the prescribed daily dose of each dispensation. The daily dose was then categorized as low (20–150 mg), medium (151–300 mg), or high (> 300 mg).

In the Cox models, the “time to event” data were used by setting the date of cancer diagnosis (from the Cancer Register) as the time when an individual started being at risk for the outcome, the date of diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorder (from Patient Register) as the time of event, and the earliest date among death (from the Causes of Death Register), emigration (from the Migration Register), and 1 year after cancer diagnosis as the time of censoring if no event happened. We adjusted for age at cancer diagnosis, sex, calendar year of cancer diagnosis, educational level, occupation, place of residence, marital status, and comorbidity in model 1 and additionally adjusted for indications for NSAID use in model 2. We created one dummy variable per indication of NSAID use. In model 3, we further adjusted for cancer type and cancer stage. We first analyzed all studied disorders together and then analyzed separately depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. We then focused on aspirin and studied the effect of recency of use, daily dose, duration of use, and combined regimens of aspirin use. To calculate stratum-specific HRs, we fitted separate models for each level of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications for use, and cancer characteristics for aspirin use as well as for current, low-dose, and long-term aspirin use. To test for effect modification by these variables, we included interaction terms between NSAID use and these variables in the multivariable models and used Wald tests to test the statistical significance of the estimated interaction terms (for one exposure and one stratification variable at a time)."

Additionally, as patients with gastrointestinal symptoms might avoid the use of NSAIDs and might have a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders in general, we conducted another sensitivity analysis where we stratified the analysis by use of proton pump inhibitors, defined through at least two dispensations, within 1 year before cancer diagnosis. In all analyses, time since cancer diagnosis was used as the underlying timescale. We used Schoenfeld residuals to test the proportional hazards assumption for the main exposure (i.e., NSAID use) in all models and found no major deviation from the assumption." "biomed_central"

Cancer patients who used aspirin alone were more likely to be male, older, less educated, were less likely to be working, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have a deceased partner, compared with patients who did not use any NSAIDs (Table 1). Compared with no users, aspirin users were more likely to have cardiovascular disease, whereas non-aspirin NSAID users were more likely to have inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis.

The study included all patients with newly diagnosed cancer in Sweden between July 2006 and December 2013 and found that aspirin use, especially long-term and low-dose use, shortly before cancer diagnosis was associated with a reduced rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders during the first year after cancer diagnosis. Non-aspirin NSAID use, on the other hand, was associated with a higher rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders." "biomed_central"
"868" "10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4" "The different results for aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs are consistent with recent studies of depression in the general population [25] and among patients with stroke [26]. We further extended the knowledge to other common psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and stress-related disorders (namely PTSD, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions). The different results for aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs are also biologically plausible. Accumulating evidence supports the role of COX-1 inhibition in attenuating neuroinflammation, leading to protection against inflammatory brain damage [28, 38, 39]. In contrast, COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to augment nitro-oxidative and oxidative stress in the brain [40], and to interfere with the resolution of inflammation by decreasing the negative immunoregulator Prostaglandin E2 [41], thereby aggravate neuroinflammation. Consistent with this, selective COX-2 inhibitors have also been related to increased psychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, and changes in cognition [42]. Taken together, COX-1, rather than COX-2 inhibition, might be the key factor in blocking neuroinflammation [38]. Our findings that COX-2 selective NSAID use was associated with a higher risk of common psychiatric disorders compared with nonselective NSAID use also supports this hypothesis. Aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, particularly at a low dose [38]. As the majority of aspirin is used at low dose, the observed protective effect of aspirin on the studied disorders is likely driven by COX-1 inhibition. The null association of high-dose aspirin may on the other hand be due to additional inhibition of COX-2 [25]. In contrast, although non-aspirin NSAIDs have mixed selectivity, they are mostly selective for COX-2 inhibition or non-selective, possibly leading to the observed harmful effect of non-aspirin NSAIDs on these psychiatric disorders. This was however partly inconsistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis that found celecoxib to have an antidepressant effect when added to traditional antidepressants [24]. One possible explanation for the contradictory findings might be the fact that we studied newly onset depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis whereas Bai et al. studied the treatment effort on prevalent depression [24]." "biomed_central"
"869" "10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4" "We further found that current, long-term, and low-dose aspirin use was associated with the lowest rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis. Current and long-term aspirin use reflects persistent anti-inflammatory activity, in addition to low-dose use with enhanced inhibition of COX-1. The stratified results by cancer stage showed clear evidence for an inverse association between aspirin and the studied disorders in most stages of cancer, apart from distant metastatic cancer. Furthermore, the effect of aspirin was more pronounced among females, in line with the proposed female-specific impact of low-dose aspirin in anti-inflammation [43]. The stronger association noted for females might alternatively be attributable to the stronger findings among breast cancer patients, which corroborates with our preclinical findings using animal models [28]. The underlying reasons for the stronger association among patients with breast cancer, compared with patients with other cancers, remain unknown. This finding, together with the fact that patients with breast cancer have indeed the highest prevalence of depression among patients of different cancer types [33], highlights a potentially specific role of inflammation in breast cancer-related depression [44]."

"870" "10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4" "The strength of the study includes the nationwide population-based study design, independent collection of information on drug exposures and psychiatric disorders, the comprehensive information of covariables, and thorough statistical analysis including multivariable adjustments for potential confounders. Common systemic and random errors are therefore minimized. Some potential limitations of the study should, however, still be noted. The Prescribed Drug Register does not include information on medications used over the counter or in hospitals and nursing homes. We speculate however that this is non-differential between individuals that would later receive a cancer diagnosis and subsequently also a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders and individuals that would not receive a diagnosis of psychiatric disorders after being diagnosed with cancer. Such misclassification would therefore most likely have diluted the magnitude of the studied association. Also, this should not have affected the results on aspirin use greatly because low-dose aspirin is mostly prescribed in Sweden [45]. Further, because of its observational nature, residual confounding due to unknown and unmeasured confounders may exist. Patients with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder might be more likely to use NSAIDs and at higher risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis. We therefore excluded patients with any psychiatric disorders—in addition to patients with depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders—prior to cancer diagnosis and observed similar results. However, the exclusion of these patients was likely incomplete because not all patients with psychiatric disorders attend health care. Similarly, we investigated the role of gastrointestinal symptoms, which could indicate high stress levels and reduced NSAID use, by stratifying the analysis by use of proton pump inhibitors during the year before cancer diagnosis and found again similar results."

Many lack consistency in measures of cognitive symptoms, ranging from self-reporting to various objective testing methods,17 18 and the majority use cross-sectional evaluation at the end of therapy with no pre-treatment cognitive data reported.2 This is an important gap in the literature given the long life expectancy of young adults with aggressive lymphoma, where impaired cognition may have a dramatic impact on function, quality of life, work, learning capacities and many aspects of social life.7

A canonical view is that this maturation is characterised by regional shrinkage in gray matter (GM) coupled to an expansion of white matter (WM)2. However, the underlying microstructural processes remain obscure. Two candidate mechanisms are proposed3, namely synaptic loss (pruning) that reduces supernumerary connections, and an increase in myelination that serves to enhance communication efficiency. Both accounts receive a degree of support from cross-sectional and ex-vivo studies4–7. What is also known is that there are substantial inter-individual differences in these growth trajectories8, with the most marked changes occurring within an age window where an emergence of psychiatric illness is increasingly common9,10. This raises a possibility that this enhanced psychiatric risk is tied to altered maturational brain trajectories during this critical developmental period11,12." "unknown"

At the extreme these axes can manifest as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) respectively. Macrostructural and cross-sectional studies suggest a link to changes in fronto-striatal regions13–16, but leave unanswered the question of whether compulsivity and impulsivity reflect consequences of altered developmental microstructural processes." "unknown"
"939" "10.1038/s41593-019-0394-3" "Here we used semi-quantitative structural MRI17 to investigate the microstructural brain development during a transition into adulthood, specifically asking whether individual variability in these developmental brain trajectories is linked to the expression of compulsive and impulsive traits. We used a novel magnetic transfer saturation (MT) imaging protocol to provide an in-vivo marker for macromolecules, in particular myelin18,19. Importantly, MT saturation has been shown to be a more direct reflection of myelin compared to other imaging protocols, such as magnetization transfer ratio20,21. It is also sensitive to developmental effects7. This renders it ideal for tracking patterns of brain maturation in longitudinal studies involving repeated scanning of participants, a crucial necessity for a full characterisation of development22. Using such a protocol, we show that during late adolescence and early adulthood cingulate cortex expresses the greatest myelin-related growth, both within gray and adjacent white matter. Individual differences in compulsivity are reflected in a reduced rate of this growth particularly within dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal regions. This contrasted with impulsivity, which was associated with reduced myelin-related growth in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that within an otherwise healthy population heterogeneity, compulsivity and impulsivity traits reflect regionally distinct differential growth in myelin growth trajectories."

Supplementary Table 1 for parametric and non-parametric results; separate cross-sectional and longitudinal effects shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a-b). These developmental changes were accompanied by increased MT in adjacent (juxta-cortical) superficial white matter with a similar topography to that seen in gray matter (Fig. 1b, mean change: 0.47±0.18% per year; max z-value voxel [z=6.18, p<.004 FDR] in posterior cingulate [5 -58 56] with 0.89% per year; cf. Supplementary Table 1), consistent with the idea that connections within gray and white matter are myelinated in concert (correlation between neighbouring gray-/white-matter voxels: Pearson r=0.25, permutation p<0.001; cf. online methods). Similar, albeit less pronounced, microstructural maturation was observed in subcortical gray matter nuclei including amygdala, ventral and posterior striatum, pallidum and dorsal thalamus (Fig. 1c, mean change: 0.29±0.06% per year; max z-value voxel [z=5.12, p<.004 FDR] in amygdala [25 4 -23] with 0.5% per year).

This raises a question as to how precisely macrostructural volume change relates to development of our myelin marker MT. A positive association in white matter volume (Fig. 2b-c; mean±SD: r=0.09±0.05, t=453, p<e-15) supports the notion that myelination is linked to the observed macrostructural volume changes, as predicted by an assumption that increased myelination leads to a white matter volume expansion23. The relatively modest, but consistent, effect size is partially explained on the basis that we only investigate the purely developmental associations and controlled for potentially confounding effects.

We observed that the association is dependent on where a voxel is located in the tissue. An overall profile of consistently negative correlations (albeit relatively small) in gray matter zones close to the white matter boundary (0-2mm from GM/WM border: t=300, p<e-15) suggest that developmental myelination may lead to a ‘whitening’ of gray matter, which in turn is likely to drive partial volume effects evident in a shrinkage of gray matter volume23,24. This means that a gray matter volume decline in deep layers during adolescence may well be driven by an increase in myelination within these same areas. This negative association was reduced with increased distance from the white matter boundary (Pearson r=0.3, p<e-15, Fig. 2c, bottom right panel). This suggests that ongoing myelination in superficial layers (i.e. close to the outer surface of the brain) contributes to an attenuated volume reduction and implies that developmental macrostructural change is the result of complex microstructural processes."

We employed a dimensional approach exploiting a heterogeneity within this otherwise healthy community sample. We computed a compound-score (first principal component, Supplementary Fig. 1a-f) from the two established obsessive-compulsive symptom questionnaires25,26 available in our sample in order to aggregate a common score to index meaningful variation (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1). Top loading items on this score (subsequently called ‘compulsivity’) reflect compulsive behaviours, such as checking, and it was strongly aligned with total scores on our obsessive-compulsive questionnaires (Pearson correlations r>.8)."

Intriguingly, the locations of reduced MT development were spatially centred in cingulate and ventral striatum, and this regional focus aligns with a specific fronto-striatal loop described in primate anatomical tracing27 studies.

This is important because a pre-existing ‘hyper-myelination’ with the reduced ongoing growth would suggest a normalisation during adolescence, whereas a ‘hypo-myelination’ prior to adolescence onset would imply that a deficient myelination was further accentuated during adolescence. We found a main effect of impulsivity evident in hypo-myelination across several, primarily anterior prefrontal, brain areas including IFG (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Figure 5b, Supplementary Table 5). An overlap between these baseline effects and areas showing a reduced ongoing growth suggests that for impulsivity a gap in myelination may exist prior to adolescence, with this gap is widening further during a transition into adulthood. The same effects were found when analysing across the entire prefrontal cortex, where a reduced MT growth was linked to both compulsivity (t(421)=1.99, p=.047) and impulsivity (t(421)=-2.80, p=.005), but where a developmental, baseline hypo-myelination in impulsivity (t(474)=2.30, p=.022) is further accentuated during late adolescent development (no such effect was found for compulsivity: t(427)=1.03, p=.30, Supplementary Figure 7a-b)."

We thus investigated whether myelin growth in IFG, a key region previously implicated in impulsivity15, related to ongoing changes in impulsivity. We found that a change in IFG MT was negatively associated with impulsivity change (Pearson r=-.27, p<.0003, Fig. 4d), indicating that individuals with the least ongoing myelin growth had a worsening impulsivity over the course of the study (irrespective of other covariates, such as baseline impulsivity or age).

Using a longitudinal, repeated-measures, MRI scanning design in a developmental sample, we provide in-vivo evidence that myelination extends into adulthood as evident in a pronounced myelin-related whole-brain MT growth. We find that the macrostructural growth pattern closely resembles that expressed in our myelin marker. The positive association between these measures in white matter suggests that macrostructural volume change is, at least in part, driven by myelination. In gray matter, depth-dependent associations suggest that macrostructural volume reduction in adolescence is the result of multiple microstructural processes. In superficial layers, ongoing myelination seems to attenuate the impact of a pruning effect, leading to an apparent slowing in gray matter volume decline. In deeper layers, close to the gray-white matter boundary, ongoing myelination appears to contribute to an inflated estimate of volume reduction, with a myelin-induced ‘whitening’ of gray matter resulting in a misclassification of gray matter voxels (i.e. partial volume effects23), leading to an apparent volume reduction. This observation extends on recent cross-sectional studies that report age-related myelin increases in deep layers7,24 and implies that developmental neuroimaging that avail of markers sensitive to specific microstructural processes17 can provide more precise accounts of the likely mechanisms underlying adolescent and early adult brain development."

"951" "10.1038/s41593-019-0394-3" "Critically, we found that individual differences in myelin-related MT growth during development is linked to common heterogeneity in compulsivity and impulsivity within an otherwise healthy sample. Both compulsivity and impulsivity were associated with a reduction in MT growth, and this reduction was almost exclusively present in fronto-striatal areas. In compulsivity, MT growth reduction was primarily expressed in dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal regions as well as ventral striatum, whereas impulsivity was more tightly linked to reduction in lateral and medial prefrontal growth. It is worth noting that variability in compulsivity/impulsivity does not reflect clinical impairment in this healthy sample37. Our findings extend on previous animal and patient studies that implicate lateral and medial prefrontal regions in attention-related functions38 and ADHD15,39. It is also noteworthy that the regions implicated in compulsivity are reported to show altered function in OCD40,41 and constitute prime targets for invasive OCD treatment interventions42,43. Critically, our findings of a reduced myelin growth linked to compulsivity suggest that differences in brain structural variables may not prevail during childhood (or only to a minor extent), but emerge during adolescence as a result of aberrant developmental processes."

"952" "10.1038/s41593-019-0394-3" "Embracing a longitudinal developmental approach, as in this study, poses distinct developmental questions. In relation to impulsivity and compulsivity, we can ask how a stable trait is related to longitudinal change as well as baseline myelination differences, where the latter is more indicative of influences emerging prior to recruitment into our study. In the case of impulsivity, we found that ongoing growth occurred in similar regions that also express a difference in baseline myelination, advocating the presence of a pre-existing myelination gap in impulsivity that further expands during adolescence. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying impulsivity have long-lasting effects on brain development, possibly affecting myelination trajectories before adolescence onset with lasting effects into adulthood." "unknown"
"953" "10.1038/s41593-019-0394-3" "An extension of the approach outlined above poses the question as to how ongoing change in compulsivity and impulsivity relate to ongoing brain maturation (i.e. correlated change). Strikingly, we found that IFG growth change was indicative of change in impulsivity. Subjects who showed worsening of their impulsivity were also those who showed the least maturational myelin-related growth in IFG. Thus, during the transition into early adulthood even though impulsivity traits as a whole do not change at a population level, individual psychiatric risk trajectories show meaningful variation, and this in turn is reflected in specific patterns of brain maturation."

This suggests reduced myelin-related growth in these areas may represent a developmental feature shared across multiple cognitive and/or genetic endophenotypes. This also implies that a more refined cognitive endophenotyping might yield spatially more defined developmental effects44–46. Compulsivity and impulsivity showed little overlap in our sample and this relative independence was also reflected in their impact on distinct fronto-striatal brain regions (with the exception of insula which showed a common growth reduction). These data leave open the possibility of a genetic pleiotropy, meaning that a shared genetic factor may drive both myelination and impulsivity/compulsivity, without a direct causal influence between brain and trait expression47. However, our correlated change finding that ongoing myelination in the IFG is directly related to how impulsivity evolves over time advocates for the possibility of a direct relationship between myelin-related maturation and impulsivity."

There is also evidence for a strong relationship between MT and myelin as measured in histological studies18,19 and we have shown previously that MT is linked to myelin gene expression7. Our longitudinal findings extend the importance of MT as a myelin marker with relevance for individual differences.

"976" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "Cognitive impairment and mood disturbance are widespread in cancer patients and survivors who have received chemotherapy. Colloquially called “chemobrain”, up to 70% of cancer patients report noticeable deficits in learning, memory, executive function and concentration after chemotherapy, and up to 40% have measurable cognitive decline (1–4). Roughly 20% of cancer patients experience mood-related disturbances including anxiety and depression (5). In many survivors these symptoms are sustained for months or years after cessation of treatment (6, 7). While the clinical phenomenon of chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment and mood disorders has been widely characterized across a number of chemotherapies and different cancer populations, the biological mechanisms responsible for these symptoms remain elusive. A primary hypothesis proposed to account for sustained cognitive impairment and mood-related disorders is that chemotherapy drives peripheral inflammation that is propagated to the brain to induce neuroinflammation, thereby driving changes in cognition and mood. This “inflammation hypothesis” has been supported by findings of cognitive and mood symptoms in cancer patients and survivors that correlate with increases in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios during and after chemotherapy (6, 8). However, other studies have failed to find any association (3, 9). Such a hypothesis is plausible given the known relationship between peripheral inflammation, brain inflammation and disturbances in cognitive function, mood and behavior in non-cancer contexts (10–16). Given that numerous studies have identified an increase in proinflammatory cytokines in response to chemotherapy, it is not surprising that inflammation would be considered a candidate mechanism (17–19)." "frontiers"
"977" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "If inflammation is causal in chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and mood disorders, then prophylactic and sustained treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs would be a potential intervention strategy to prevent these symptoms in cancer patients. We have previously reported that the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin prevents tumor-induced cognitive impairment in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer (11), suggesting its potential to be given to patients prior to chemotherapy to reduce cognitive impairment induced by the cancer. To date, no one has tested the utility for aspirin to combat chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. Here we determine if aspirin may also serve to alleviate chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. We test the immediate and sustained impact of a commonly employed chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, on memory performance and depression-like behavior in non-tumor bearing mice, and examine the inflammatory profile of these 24 h after the last dose of paclitaxel and 2 weeks later. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used treatment for multiple cancer types including breast, ovarian, lung, bladder, and prostate cancer that has been associated with symptoms of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in cancer patients (20, 21). Paclitaxel has also been shown to alter plasma inflammatory cytokines in patients (22). Consistent with those clinical observations, we show evidence of peripheral inflammation, as indicated by increased plasma cytokines 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment, but no evidence of elevated cytokines in the brain at any time point. The findings suggest that inflammation may not be responsible for either the immediate or late effects of paclitaxel on cognition, and confirm that aspirin is an unlikely intervention strategy to prevent or treat paclitaxel-induced chemobrain."

This test comprises of 3 different phases—acquisition, retention, and the test phase. During the acquisition phase, mice were allowed to explore two identical objects for 5 min. Mice were then removed from the arena and placed back into their home cage for 5 min (retention phase). During the test phase, mice were returned to the arena with one of the original now-familiar objects replaced with a novel object (with similar dimensions), placed in a novel location in the arena. BALB/c mice have been shown to perform poorly on the novel object recognition test compared to other strains. BALB/c were chosen to align with previous studies demonstrating cancer-induced memory impairment for which inflammation was shown to be causal and preventable with aspirin (11). Pilot studies indicated that a retention phase of 5 min provides optimal novel object/novel place preference in BALB/c mice while allowing deficits in memory from chemotherapy to be reliably observed. Mouse exploratory behavior, including time spent exploring both old and novel objects and distance travelled, were recorded and analyzed using Viewer III software (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany). Novel object recognition was calculated by determining the percentage of time spent with the novel object divided by the total time spent exploring all the objects in the arena. Mice were excluded if they spent less than 20 s exploring the familiar objects in the acquisition phase. As the same cohort of mice were used in the test at both time points (24 h and 13 days after paclitaxel), different objects were used between these tests to ensure novelty of the objects to mice."

Both tests are sensitive and well-validated methods, where depression-like behavior in rodents is indicated by reduced consumption of sucrose solution or increased immobility during the forced swim test (25, 26). Paclitaxel reduced sucrose preference, which reached significance based on multiple comparisons on days 17-19 (F

Reduced sucrose preference could indicate depression-like behavior, or may be attributable to chemotherapy-induced changes in taste perception, which would not impact behavior in the forced swim test. To investigate this, we quantified the effect of chemotherapy treatment on taste bud density and taste receptor expression. Patients report a loss of taste perception after chemotherapy (27, 28), which has been attributed to loss of taste buds and the receptors that signal flavor perception (29, 30). Perception of sweet flavors are determined by receptors encoded by Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 genes, whereas umami flavors involve Tas1r1 and Tas1r3 genes. Paclitaxel had no effect on the quantity of tongue papillae (Figure 2A), but reduced expression of Tas1r1 mRNA [t

In doing so, this study replicated clinical studies that demonstrate peripheral inflammatory markers occur alongside mood and cognition changes in patients that receive chemotherapy (32–34), suggesting that paclitaxel alone may contribute to the increase of these inflammatory markers.

Paclitaxel-induced impairment in the novel object/novel place test suggests that hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is vulnerable to paclitaxel whereas heavily-utilized working memory and spatial memory may be more resilient to the impact of paclitaxel. This contention is supported by studies showing that the hippocampus is sensitive to impairment in neurogenesis by paclitaxel (35, 36). Similarly, while paclitaxel induced anhedonia, it did not cause other depression-like phenotypes such as learned helplessness in the forced swim test, suggesting certain domains of depression may be more susceptible to the impact of chemotherapy than others. Future studies should explore the possibility that the changes in sucrose preference reflect anhedonia specifically and not paclitaxel-induced changes to the interoceptive state of the mice, which are partially refuted by the examination of tongue papillae and taste receptor gene expression in this study.

Consistent with clinical findings, paclitaxel caused immediate and long-lasting impairment in memory and anhedonia in mice, but peripheral inflammation only became apparent 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment. Regardless, peripheral cytokines measured 2 weeks after paclitaxel did not propagate inflammation to the brain (Figure 5D), which disputes the assumption made in patients that chemotherapy-induced inflammation in the body is always reflected in the brain. There was also no evidence of inflammation in the brain at 24 h after paclitaxel treatment despite evidence of memory impairment and anhedonia, and paclitaxel having crossed the blood-brain barrier. These findings are discordant with the contention that transit of paclitaxel into the brain induces compartmentalized neuroinflammation, leading to memory loss and affective symptoms in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy." "frontiers"
"1010" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "The absence of inflammation after chemotherapy reported here is supported by other preclinical studies (39, 40). Nonetheless, some studies have shown that chemotherapy increases inflammatory cytokines in blood and brain tissue (18, 19, 41–43). As each of these animal studies used different chemotherapeutic agents, doses, or treatment regimens, it is possible the role of inflammation on chemobrain may be specific to chemotherapy type or magnitude of exposure." "frontiers"
"1011" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "The fact that increases in cytokines were not observed in plasma until 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment despite immediate effects on memory and anhedonia is supported by clinical data. In breast cancer patients no significant changes in plasma inflammatory cytokines were observed until 3 weeks after cessation of the entire chemotherapy regimen, despite impairment in perceived cognitive function being reported during chemotherapy treatment (8). Together these findings suggest a temporal dissociation between chemotherapy-induced cytokine production and symptoms of chemobrain, and supports the contention that alternative mechanisms are responsible for the induction of at least some symptoms of chemobrain." "frontiers"
"1012" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "While the results do not support a role for cytokines in chemobrain, it is possible that other inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins contribute to chemobrain. Paclitaxel has been shown to affect macrophages to induce the expression of cyclooxygenase-2—the enzyme that converts arachidonic acids to prostaglandins (44)—and increase the production of prostaglandin E2 (45). As prostaglandins have been implicated in the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases (46), it is possible that paclitaxel may similarly increase production of prostaglandins in mice, contributing to memory impairment. However, administration of aspirin, a non-selective anti-inflammatory drug that blocks cyclooxygenase-2, had no effect on paclitaxel-induced memory impairment in the current study, supporting the contention that inflammation may not contribute to paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. These findings also indicate that while aspirin may have therapeutic utility for the prevention of tumor-induced cognitive impairment (11), aspirin is unlikely to show benefit in targeting paclitaxel-induced chemobrain. It will be important to determine the potential use of aspirin to target chemobrain symptoms induced by other chemotherapeutic agents and dosing schedules that have been shown to increase inflammatory cytokines (19, 41–43)." "frontiers"
"1013" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "Study limitations may have influenced the capacity to observe noticeable changes in cytokine levels in paclitaxel-treated mice. Firstly, we assessed cytokines in whole brains, which may mask the effects of chemotherapy on cytokines in specific brain regions (41). Secondly, it is possible that the method of euthanasia influenced cytokine levels, which has been previously reported (47). However, all mice were euthanized using the same method." "frontiers"
"1014" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "The current findings offer important insights into correlative evidence that cognitive impairment and mood-related symptoms are associated with elevated inflammatory markers in clinical (6, 34) and preclinical studies of cancer treatment (19, 48). This study confirms recent findings that paclitaxel is able to cross the blood brain barrier in the absence of cancer (35), raising the possibility of direct cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel on cells of the brain. Recent studies support this assertion with evidence that chemotherapy drugs induce apoptosis in neurons, reduce neurogenesis and synaptic integrity, and cause mitochondrial dysfunction (19, 40, 42, 48, 49). Additionally, the downregulation of vesicular zinc in the hippocampus has also been shown to mediate the effect of paclitaxel on hippocampal neurogenesis (36). Moreover, the presence of cancer could enhance “leakiness” of the blood-brain barrier (50), thereby potentiating the penetration of paclitaxel to the brain and the magnitude of neurotoxicity. However, as chemotherapy could reduce cancer burden, chemotherapy may equally reduce the effect of cancer-induced cognitive impairment (11). Emerging studies examining the effects of both chemotherapy and cancer on cognitive impairment will be able to provide more insights into the complex interaction between chemotherapy, cancer and the brain (40)." "frontiers"
"1015" "10.3389/fonc.2020.564965" "Our findings question the role of inflammation in paclitaxel-induced chemobrain. The findings show aspirin is unlikely to be effective in preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, in contrast to recent findings that aspirin may be effectively repurposed to combat cancer-induced cognitive impairment (11).

"1021" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) describes the acute onset or worsening of obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms and/or anorexia in temporal relation with other severe neuropsychiatric and somatic symptoms. Secondary signs include anxiety, emotional lability, irritability/aggression, regression, deterioration in school performance, sensory and motor abnormalities and somatic signs such as enuresis, sleep disturbance and pain [1]. The diagnosis of PANS requires an acute onset, but subsequent clinical courses may range from fully remitting after a single episode, to a waxing and waning course with intense exacerbations or flares, or even more chronic or progressive courses. Exacerbations or flares have been described in PANS since the initial definition of the syndrome, without being part of the diagnostic criteria [1]. In the acute phase, the symptoms are often severe and may lead to significant loss of function [2]. Psychiatric comorbidities are common and may need to be treated in parallel to the PANS-related symptoms [3, 4]. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) constitutes a sub-group of patients within the broader PANS construct, which requires the verified presence of a streptococcal infection temporally associated with the onset of symptoms [5]."

"1022" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "While the psychiatric and somatic status of patients with PANS/PANDAS has been reasonably well described in cross-sectional studies, including high rates of pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorders and a strong association with autoimmune disease in both patients and first degree relatives, there is a shortage of long-term follow-up data of PANS/PANDAS cohorts [2, 3]. The available longitudinal data primarily originates from a handful of case reports and chart reviews, methods that not well suited for assessing the fraction of participants who may be remitting [6]. In a notable exception, Leon et al. described longitudinal outcomes for 33 patients with PANDAS who were followed up by telephone after participation in a randomized trial of intra-venous immunoglobulins (IVIG) compared to placebo, 0.5 to 4.8 years after trial completion [7]. At baseline, participants were required to meet the criteria for clinically significant obsessive–compulsive symptoms, in addition to at least three other comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms. During the follow-up period, a majority (72%) of the patients had experienced at least one exacerbation of PANDAS symptoms, defined as a noticeable increase in a child’s previous PANDAS symptoms for a period of at least 24 h. A small fraction (12%) experienced clinically significant OCD-symptoms at follow-up, suggesting that the long-term prognosis of children with PANDAS was generally positive. However, a small proportion of cases (9%) had a more chronic course. A third of the children (33%) had received at least one new psychiatric diagnosis during the follow-up period, the most common being attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (18%). No face-to-face psychiatric or somatic evaluations or laboratory tests were conducted. To our knowledge, there are no published systematic follow-up data on patients with PANS, and thus their prognosis in the medium-to-long-term timeframe is currently unknown." "springer_us"

To minimize the risk of selectively following-up chronic patients in need of medical attention, we aimed to re-contact families regardless of whether they were still active in our clinic or not. Specifically, we conducted an assessment of current psychiatric and somatic health status, including laboratory tests, at the time of follow-up and investigated clinical characteristics that may influence disease course and prognosis in our cohort.

The latter was particularly important to limit the risk of selectively following-up chronic patients in need of medical attention. The main finding was that, although full remission was rare, the majority of children with PANS were significantly improved at the time of follow-up. Approximately 85% of the participants had much or very much improved PANS symptoms. Only a small proportion (15%) had clinically significant obsessive–compulsive symptoms at follow-up. Accordingly, the use of SSRIs and antipsychotics was relatively rare at follow-up.

This apparent discrepancy between clinician and subjective ratings may suggest that our instruments do not capture the full extent of the patients’ difficulties. Alternatively, clinicians and families may interpret PANS symptoms differently. This is an important topic that requires further investigation, as it is critical for the design of clinical trials and the choice of appropriate outcome measures." "springer_us"
"1068" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "A striking finding was that 38% of the participants had received an additional neuropsychiatric diagnosis during the follow-up period. Even though our naturalistic sample includes PANS patients with co-occurring autism and other severe psychiatric symptoms, thereby comprising a more complex patient group, the findings are similar to those of the Leon et al. PANDAS cohort [7]. They also reported that 33% of the participants had received a psychiatric diagnosis at follow-up, ADHD being the most common one. This highlights the importance of regular neuropsychiatric assessments in this patient group. The identification and correct diagnosis of these neuropsychiatric syndromes will facilitate the deployment of evidence-based interventions for specific problems, alongside any additional interventions required for PANS. An exclusive focus on PANS symptoms risks missing opportunities for intervention in other areas." "springer_us"
"1069" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "In our clinic, all suspected PANS patients are routinely evaluated with extensive somatic assessments and laboratory analyses, which are both time-consuming and costly. At intake, these procedures may be important in order to exclude other, potentially treatable, conditions such as infections, autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, psoriasis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We previously reported baseline data for the cohort, showing high levels of somatic signs at intake (61% exhibiting skin abnormalities such as eczema or abrasions; 46% exhibiting signs of ear, nose or throat infections; and 23% showing neurological abnormalities including choreatic movements) [3]. However, at follow-up, the somatic findings were much rarer and often did not require a specific treatment. This suggests that the value of such a comprehensive assessment at follow-up may be limited, at least in routine clinical care. We suggest to mainly focus on signs of current infection. Because of the similarities between PANS and Sydenham’s chorea/rheumatic fever, we believe it is also advisable to routinely perform a heart auscultation, in order to rule out any murmurs indicative of heart inflammation." "springer_us"
"1070" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "Published data of inflammatory markers in PANS patients are scarce and difficult to interpret, since the level of disease activity is rarely rated at the time of testing. Our findings indicate that thyroid abnormalities may be more frequent at follow-up (anti-TPO 19%, TSH abnormalities 15% and low T4 11%) than at baseline (anti-TPO 11%, TSH abnormalities 10% and low T4 0%) [3]. IL-1-β and TNF-α levels were significantly elevated in both symptomatic patients and chronic-static/progressive patients. Interestingly, none of the patients in the initial cohort had elevated IL-1-β and/or TNF-α levels at baseline [3]. In a naturalistic study describing the characteristics of the first 47 consecutive patients at the Stanford PANS clinic, Frankovich et al. reported positive Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANAs) in 28% of the patients fulfilling PANS criteria [2]. At baseline, we recorded positive ANAs in 17% of the patients [3], and at follow-up only in 7%. In the absence of robust biomarkers for PANS, these findings clearly indicate that the value of a of full laboratory work-up for clinical practice is currently limited. We suggest the full analyses should include measurement of CBC, thyroid, liver and kidney markers, inflammatory markers, IgG (including sub-classes), IgA and IgM, ANA, celiac test and throat culture at disease onset or when evaluating the need of potential immunomodulatory treatments. A smaller number of clinically relevant tests will suffice during the follow-up. These tests should be chosen based on current signs of infection, abnormalities in the initial work-up, comorbidities or ongoing pharmacological treatments." "springer_us"
"1071" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "A novel aspect of our work is that we propose operational definitions of flare and clinical course in PANS, based on our long experience with this patient group. Previous definitions of flare and clinical course in patients with PANS/PANDAS are difficult to use in practice. Leon et al.defined a flare as a noticeable increase in a child’s previous PANDAS symptoms for a period of at least 24 h [7], which we consider problematic because this may risk capturing the natural waxing and waning of symptoms rather than a true flare. In a chart review of 218 consecutive patients at the Stanford PANS Clinic, Brown et al. defined a flare as an acute neuropsychiatric deterioration meeting strict PANS or PANDAS criteria, without the requirement of a specified time period [19], We believe that our proposed definition of a flare is more precise and, in our experience, easier to use in the clinic." "springer_us"
"1072" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "Regarding previous definitions of clinical course, Brown et al. employed the following definitions: relapsing–remitting with flares and an approximate return to baseline without need for immunomodulatory treatment; chronic-static with unchanging symptoms lasting at least 9 months; and progressive as a chronic course worsening in intensity over time [19]. These definitions may be ambiguous, as a patient with a flare resolved after administration of an immunomodulatory treatment will be difficult to classify as either relapsing–remitting or chronic. Our proposed definitions will hopefully enable classification of different disease courses regardless of treatment given, an essential factor in the research setting and clinical practice alike." "springer_us"
"1073" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "Despite the small sample size, our proposed definitions of flare and clinical course seemed to meaningfully distinguish the chronic and non-chronic course groups at follow-up regarding their level of impairment and subsequent need of healthcare resources. The groups also differed in some of the laboratory analyses (IL-1-β, TNF-α and IgM), but their clinical significance is currently unclear. However, as this represents a proinflammatory immune response, and there was also a link to autoimmunity (also caused by proinflammatory immune responses), further investigation of relative immune activation sensitivity is warranted to further explore patient subgroups. The chronic course group had an earlier onset, but follow-up time was comparable across the two groups; thus the natural course of the disorder is unlikely to explain the observed differences. Interestingly, the two groups had similar symptom severity at baseline but the chronic course group had significantly lower CGAS scores (i.e. more impairment), suggesting that both early onset and impaired function may potentially be useful predictors of chronicity in this patient group. The small sample size prevents further analyses of clinical characteristics predictive of disease course and prognosis, but we observed a trend towards higher rates of autoimmune or inflammatory comorbidity in the chronic course group. The identification of such predictive and prognostic factors should be a priority of future research with larger samples." "springer_us"
"1074" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "To our knowledge, this is the first naturalistic long-term follow-up study of a well-characterized PANS cohort. The main limitation of the study is the small sample size. The follow-up assessments coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even smaller inclusion rate when previously consented participants wished to avoid visiting the clinic solely for research purposes. We had a particularly high data loss on the laboratory tests due to limited possibilities to travel to the laboratory to provide a blood sample. The baseline characteristics of the participants who were not available at follow-up were comparable to those of the participants who were available, somewhat mitigating this limitation. Finally, some of the measures administered at follow-up (e.g. CYBOCS and YGTSS) were not available at baseline, precluding certain longitudinal analyses." "springer_us"
"1075" "10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4" "This long-term follow-up study showed that, although full remission was rare, the majority of children with PANS were significantly improved over a mean 3-year follow-up period. However, a non-negligible minority of patients displayed a chronic-static/progressive course and required additional treatments. Interestingly, these treatments seldom concerned OCD or tics, as these symptoms seemed to remit during the follow-up in a large proportion of participants. The proposed operational definitions of flare and clinical course appeared to meaningfully distinguish the chronic and non-chronic groups at follow-up regarding their level of impairment and subsequent need of healthcare resources and may be useful in clinical practice, in future clinical trials, and in the development of treatment guidelines."

Estimated annual incidence in Europe is 24.3 and 12.7 per 100 000 person-years for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, respectively. It can occur at any age, but is more common in younger people. Education, work, social and family life can all be disrupted by the unpredictable nature of debilitating and embarrassing symptoms. There is no ‘complete’ cure for IBD and many patients are on medications with unpleasant side effects, yet despite this end up needing invasive surgery with considerable impact on quality of life. Comorbid mood disorder can affect quality of life in patients with IBD.1 Unsurprisingly, patients with IBD are twice as likely to suffer from depression and are also more likely to have an anxiety disorder than other people.2 IBD standards have previously stated that a psychologist or counsellor is among the ‘essential supporting services’ that the IBD team should have access to.3 Furthermore, this has been identified locally at a trust level by the IBD Patient Panel as an area of priority need. Despite this, growing evidence suggests that psychological stress can increase activity of IBD.4 However, there is insufficient access to psychological support services for patients with IBD in the UK. Current evidence demonstrates that psychological therapies improve quality of life in the short term and supports the efficacy of antidepressant medication in improving disease activity."

"1106" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Adolescence is a time of profound and genetically mediated changes in whole-brain network organization (Larsen and Luna, 2018; Menon, 2013). Adolescent development is important for the maturation in cognitive and educational functions and brain health more generally, a notion reinforced by the overlapping onset of several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (Hong et al., 2019; Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Paus et al., 2008). With increased capacity to carry out longitudinal studies in large samples, it is now possible to track changes in brain network organization within subjects, providing insights into maturational processes, their biological underpinnings, and their effects on behavior and cognition." "elife"
"1107" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "By offering an in vivo window into brain organization, neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer the ability to track adolescent brain development over time. Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in neurodevelopmental cohorts have focused on the analysis of morphological changes (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017), including MRI-based cortical thickness (Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017) and volumetric measures (Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017). Studies robustly show initial gray matter increases until mid-late childhood followed by a decline for the rest of the lifespan. During adolescence, cortical thickness decreases in widespread brain regions (Khundrakpam et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2006; Sotiras et al., 2017; Tamnes et al., 2017). Thus, contextualizing connectome alterations relative to established patterns of cortical thickness findings may establish whether inter-regional network changes occur above and beyond these diffuse effects of regional morphological maturation. More recent work explored changes in intracortical microstructure, capitalizing on myelin-sensitive contrasts such as magnetization transfer ratio (MT) mapping, which generally suggest overall increases in adolescence (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016) together with depth-dependent shifts in intracortical myelin profiles (Paquola et al., 2019a). Besides the increasingly recognized changes in cortico-cortical connectivity, studying subcortical regions offer additional insights for understanding brain maturation during adolescence. Indeed, an increasing body of connectome-level studies emphasizes that subcortical structures contribute significantly to patterns of whole-brain organization, dynamics, and cognition (Hwang et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2020; Shine et al., 2019). In prior neurodevelopmental studies, it has been shown that the volumes of the striatum and thalamus decrease between adolescence and adulthood, potentially paralleling processes resulting in cortical gray matter reduction during this time window (Herting et al., 2018). A close inter-relationship between cortical and subcortical development is also suggested by recent functional connectivity work suggesting that cortico-subcortical pathways are intrinsically remodeled during adolescence (Váša et al., 2020), and these changes affect cognitive functioning. Collectively, these prior findings suggest measurable trajectories of cortical and subcortical structural organization and support associations to cognitive development (Baum et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2006)." "elife"
"1108" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Recent conceptual and methodological advances enable the study of brain organization, development, and substrates underlying cognitive trajectories in humans. One key modality to track developmental changes in structural connectivity is diffusion MRI (dMRI), a technique sensitive to the displacement of water in tissue that allows for the non-invasive approximation of inter-regional white matter tracts. Prior cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in children and adolescents outlined changes in the microstructure of major white matter tracts during development based on the analysis of dMRI-derived tissue parameters (Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Schmithorst and Yuan, 2010). These findings have been complemented by assessments of brain network topology using graph-theoretical analysis (Baker et al., 2015; Hagmann et al., 2010; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019), which reported a relatively preserved spatial layout of structural hubs across adolescent development on the one hand (Hagmann et al., 2010), yet with a continued strengthening of their connectivity profiles, likely underpinned by the ongoing maturation of long-range association fibers (Baker et al., 2015; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019)." "elife"
"1109" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "One emerging approach to address connectome organization and development comes from the application of manifold learning techniques to connectivity datasets. By decomposing whole-brain structural and functional connectomes into a series of lower dimensional axes capturing spatial gradients of connectivity variations, these techniques provide a compact perspective on large-scale connectome organization (Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019b; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). In addition, these techniques capture multiple, potentially overlapping gradients in connectivity along cortical mantle, which can represent both subregional heterogeneity and multiplicity within a brain region (Haak and Beckmann, 2020). In prior work, we showed that multiple dMRI gradients can illustrate structural underpinnings of dynamic functional communication in the adult human connectome (Park et al., 2021b). In line with prior conceptual accounts, the low-dimensional eigenvectors (i.e., gradients) derived from these techniques provide continuous dimensions of cortical organization, and thus the eigenvectors can jointly generate intrinsic coordinate systems of the brain based on connectivity (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018). Beyond these methodological considerations, prior work has shown that the principal gradients estimated from resting-state functional (Margulies et al., 2016), microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b), and diffusion MRI (Park et al., 2021a) all converge broadly along an established model of sensory-fugal hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998), allowing gradient mapping techniques to make conceptual contact to theories of cortical organization, development, and evolution (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969; Sanides, 1962). An emerging literature has indeed shown utility of the gradient framework to study primate evolution and cross-species alignment (Blazquez Freches et al., 2020; Valk et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020), neurodevelopment (Hong et al., 2019; Paquola et al., 2019a), as well as plasticity and structure-function coupling (Park et al., 2021b; Valk Sofie et al., 2020; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019). In a recent assessment by our team, manifold learning techniques have been applied to myelin sensitive intracortical MT data, showing an increasing myeloarchitectural differentiation of association cortex throughout adolescence (Paquola et al., 2019a). Still, the longitudinal maturation of dMRI connectomes in children and adolescents using manifold techniques has not been tracked." "elife"

Recently established resources, such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2015), can be utilized to spatially associate macroscale imaging/connectome data with the expression patterns of thousands of genes. These findings have already been applied in the study of healthy adults (Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Park et al., 2020) and typically developing adolescents (Mascarell Maričić et al., 2020; Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014; Paquola et al., 2019a; Vértes et al., 2016; Whitaker et al., 2016), as well as individuals suffering from prevalent brain disorders (Altmann et al., 2018; Hashimoto et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2017; Park et al., 2021a; Patel et al., 2021; Romero-Garcia et al., 2019). The gene sets that co-vary with in vivo findings can furthermore be subjected to gene set enrichment analyses to discover potentially implicated molecular, cellular, and pathological processes (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2013; Dougherty et al., 2010; Kuleshov et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2019; Romero-Garcia et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2005). For example, studies in newborns have shown that cortical morphology reflects spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in fetuses, linking molecular mechanisms to in vivo measures of cortical development in early life (Ball et al., 2020). Work in adolescents has furthermore shown that developmental changes in regional cortical thickness measures and myelin proxies spatially co-localize with the expression patterns of genes involved in synaptic and oligodendroglial function (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016). Building on these prior investigations, the current study aimed at exploring whether adolescent structural connectome reconfigurations, assessed using manifold learning techniques, reflect the expression patterns of specific genes in order to identify potential molecular signatures of macroscale structural network development."

"1111" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Here, we charted developmental changes in structural connectome organization, based on an accelerated longitudinal neuroimaging study involving 208 participants investigated between 14 and 26 years of age (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). Compared to cross-sectional designs, longitudinal studies track within-subject change, separating developmental effects from between-subject variability (Louis et al., 1986). We first estimated longitudinal changes in structural connectome manifolds across age. This compact and lower dimensional space furthermore allowed for the integration of connectome-level findings with changes in MRI-based measures of cortical morphology and intracortical myelin. We furthermore projected subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into the manifold space to assess parallel developmental shifts of these pathways in the studied time window. Connectome manifold changes were contextualized at the molecular level via transcriptomic association and developmental enrichment analyses based on post-mortem datasets, which furthermore allowed for data-driven exploration of time windows of spatially co-localized gene sets. To also assess behavioral associations of connectome manifold changes, we utilized supervised machine learning to predict future measures of cognitive function quantified via the intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ is a widely used marker of general cognitive abilities, which shows good test–retest reliability (Brown and May, 1979; Watkins and Smith, 2013; Catron, 1978; G.-Matarazzo et al., 1973; Snow et al., 1989; Wagner and Caldwell, 1979) and has previously been applied to index overall cognitive function during development (Crespi, 2016; Garde et al., 2005; Garde et al., 2000; Koenis et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016; Ramsden et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020). In the study of neurodevelopment, neuroimaging reports have previously assessed associations between IQ and large-scale network measures in children to adolescents (Koenis et al., 2018; Ramsden et al., 2011; NSPN Consortium et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020).

Participants (48% female) had a mean age of 18.82 years (range = 14–25 years) at baseline and 19.95 years (15–26 years) at follow-up.

Individual manifolds were aligned to a template manifold estimated from a hold-out dataset (see Materials and methods) (Langs et al., 2015; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). Three eigenvectors (E1, E2, and E3) explained approximately 50% of information in the template affinity matrix (i.e., 20.7/15.8/13.5% for E1/E2/E3, respectively), with each eigenvector showing a different axis of spatial variation across the cortical mantle (Figure 1A). Eigenvectors depicted a continuous differentiation between medial and lateral cortices (E1), between inferior and superior cortices (E2), and between anterior and posterior areas (E3). For each participant and time point, we calculated manifold eccentricity, which depicts how far each node is located from the center of the template manifold (see Materials and methods). It thus quantifies the changes in eigenvectors between the time points in terms of expansion and contraction instead of comparing multidimensional connectome manifolds (Bethlehem et al., 2020).

Stratifying these effects along four cortical hierarchical levels, defined using an established taxonomy based on patterns of laminar differentiation and tract-tracing data in non-human primates (Mesulam, 1998), we identified peak effects in heteromodal association and paralimbic areas (Figure 1D). Convergent findings were observed when analyzing the effects with respect to intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), showing highest effects in default mode and limbic areas followed by visual and frontoparietal cortices.

We found significant positive associations for degree centrality and within-module degree, suggesting that connectome manifold expansion reflects a concurrent increase of overall connectivity, particularly within modules.

We replicated these findings by showing cortical thinning in almost all brain regions across the studied age window as well as reductions in depth-dependent MT skewness, suggestive of supragranular enrichment of myelin (Figure 2A). To evaluate whether the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity were robust above and beyond these regional changes in cortical thickness and MT, we implemented linear mixed effect models including cortical thickness and MT as covariates in the analysis of developmental change in manifold eccentricity (Figure 2B). While we observed virtually identical spatial patterns of manifold eccentricity changes in models that controlled for thickness, MT skewness, and both, age-related effects in regions of significant manifold eccentricity findings (see Figure 1C) were reduced in models that additionally controlled for these covariates (average reduction of t-value in models controlling for thickness/MT skewness/both = 42/18/68%)."

Here, we carried out a transcriptomic association analysis and developmental enrichment analyses to contextualize the age-related manifold eccentricity changes with respect to patterns of post-mortem gene expression from a sample of independent adults (Figure 4A). Specifically, leveraging mixed effect models, we associated the spatial patterns of manifold change across age in the NSPN sample (controlling for covariation of cortical thickness and MT) with cortical maps of post-mortem gene expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2015; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Markello et al., 2020).

We performed developmental gene set enrichment analysis using the cell-type-specific expression analysis (CSEA) tool, which compares the selected gene list with developmental enrichment profiles (see Materials and methods) (Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014). This analysis highlights developmental time windows across macroscopic brain regions in which genes are strongly expressed. We found marked expression of the genes enriched from childhood onward in the cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum (FDR < 0.001; Figure 4B).

Independent variables were combinations of cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their age-related trajectory data. We used elastic net regularization with nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005) (see Materials and methods), and repeated the prediction 100 times with different training and test dataset compositions to mitigate subject selection bias. Across cross-validation and iterations, 6.24 ± 5.74 (mean ± SD) features were selected to predict IQ using manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline, 6.20 ± 5.14 cortical features at baseline and maturational change, 5.45 ± 5.99 cortical and subcortical features at baseline, and 5.16 ± 5.43 at baseline and maturational change, suggesting that adding more independent variables may not per se lead to improvement in prediction accuracy. The manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline significantly predicted future IQ score (mean ± SD r = 0.14 ± 0.04; mean absolute error [MAE] = 8.93 ± 0.16, p=0.09). Prediction performance was slightly improved when we combined the manifold eccentricity both at baseline and differences between follow-up and baseline (r = 0.18 ± 0.04; MAE = 9.10 ± 0.19, p=0.04) (Figure 5A).

We found that our model outperformed this baseline model (Meng’s z-test p < 0.001) (Meng et al., 1992).

"1176" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "The current study tracked whole-brain structural connectome maturation from adolescence to young adulthood in an accelerated longitudinal imaging cohort (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). Capitalizing on advanced manifold learning techniques applied to dMRI-derived connectomes, we established that higher-order association cortices in prefrontal, medial and superior temporal areas, as well as parieto-occipital regions, expanded in their connectome manifold representation indicative of an increased differentiation of these systems from the rest of the brain in adolescence. Parallel topological analysis based on graph theory indicated that these changes anatomically coincided with increases in the within-module connectivity of transmodal cortices. Findings were consistent across the different acquisition sites and biological sexes, and similar albeit slightly weaker when correcting connectivity manifolds for MRI-based measures of macrostructure (cortical thickness) and microstructure (skewness of MT depth profile). In addition to the cortical manifold expansion, we found parallel reconfigurations of subcortical connectivity patterns for the caudate and thalamus. Decoding our findings with post-mortem gene expression maps implicated genes enriched in adolescence and young adulthood, again pointing to both cortical as well as subcortical targets. Finally, the combination of both cortical and subcortical manifold measures predicted behavioral measures of intelligence at follow-up, with higher performance than cortical or subcortical data alone. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into adolescent structural connectome maturation and indicate how multiple scales of cortical and subcortical organization can interact in typical neurodevelopment." "elife"
"1177" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Leveraging advanced manifold learning, we depicted macroscale connectome organization along continuous cortical axes. Similar approaches have previously been harnessed to decompose microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b; Paquola et al., 2019a) and functional MRI (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2019; Margulies et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2019; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). These techniques are appealing as they offer a low-dimensional perspective on connectome reconfigurations in a data-driven and spatially unconstrained manner. In our longitudinal study, we could identify marked connectome expansion during adolescence, mainly encompassing transmodal and heteromodal association cortex in prefrontal, temporal, and posterior regions, the territories known to mature later in development (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006). Findings remained consistent when we considered a linear dimensionality reduction technique, suggesting robustness to methodological details of this analysis. Connectome expansion can be understood as an overall greater differentiation of the connectivity of these areas from the rest of the brain as they would then cover wider portions of the corresponding manifold space. Manifold expansion in higher-order areas correlated with an increase in their within-module connectivity, but not with participation coefficient and connectivity distance measures that would be more reflective of their between-module connectivity. In light of potential limitations of dMRI tractography in detecting long-distance fiber tracts (Betzel et al., 2019; Maier-Hein et al., 2017), we cannot rule out a reduced sensitivity of our approach for the study of long-range inter-regional connections. Nevertheless, our diffusion modeling was based on constrained spherical-deconvolution approaches together with SIFT2-based tractogram filtering, in addition to using a distance-dependent thresholding approach that may have partially mitigated these limitations (Betzel et al., 2019). Thus, our findings do overall confirm and extend prior dMRI studies that have focused on specific tracts and that have indicated considerable developmental shifts in diffusion parameters, such as increases in fractional anisotropy and decreases in mean diffusivity in early and late adolescence (Olson et al., 2009). Other studies have furthermore reported increased streamline count estimates (Genc et al., 2020). In this context, our macroscale manifold findings likely reflect an ongoing consolidation of transmodal cortical communities. These findings align with prior graph-theoretical studies, which have pointed to concurrent increases in network integration and consolidation of network hubs from late childhood to early adulthood (Baker et al., 2015; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019). Considering their distributed regional substrate, these network effects are likely driven by the ongoing maturation of fiber bundles that interconnect these higher-order cortices, including superior longitudinal fascicules, but also thalamic and basal ganglia pathways (Tamnes et al., 2010), throughout adolescence." "elife"
"1178" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Projecting manifold solutions back onto cortical surfaces allowed us to integrate our connectome manifold results with morphometric and intracortical intensity indices obtained via structural and quantitative MRI contrasts in the same participants. We were thus able to balance the network-level effects against trajectories of intracortical remodeling. Longitudinal changes in these cortical features were overall in agreement with prior work, suggesting marked reductions in cortical thickness in adolescence (Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Shaw et al., 2006), possibly reflecting synaptic pruning processes (Petanjek et al., 2011) together with decreases in the skewness of intracortical MT profiles, a feature sensitive to preferential myelination of supragranular layers (Paquola et al., 2019a). Although we still observed significant age-related changes in manifold eccentricity after controlling for these intracortical and morphological measures, the effect sizes of our findings were reduced. This effect was particularly evident when running a parallel analysis that additionally controlled for depth-dependent shifts in cortical microstructure, a finding in line with more generally demonstrated links between cortical microstructural depth profiles and inter-regional connectivity (Paquola et al., 2019b). In the context of adolescence and prior findings in the NSPN dataset (Paquola et al., 2019a), these results thus suggest a coupled process that affects depth-dependent shifts in cortical myeloarchitecture, on the one hand, and adolescent shifts in macroscale connectome organization, on the other hand, as shown by our longitudinal manifold analyses." "elife"
"1179" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "In addition to emphasizing a distributed set of association cortices and their cortico-cortical connections, analysis of subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns highlighted parallel developmental processes in several subcortical structures and their connections, particularly the caudate and thalamus. These findings were independently supported by transcriptomic association studies and developmental enrichment analyses, which implicated genes expressed in cortical regions and these subcortical structures during late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. The caudate nucleus of the striatum has long been recognized to play an important role in mediating large-scale cortical network organization (Aglioti, 1997; Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Graybiel, 1995), a finding also increasingly recognized in the connectome literature (Hwang et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2020; Shine et al., 2019). It is known to modulate activity in prefrontal association areas during memory-driven internal thought processes (Aglioti, 1997), and higher-order cognitive functions, notably motivational processes, decision making, as well as cognitive control and executive functions more generally (Aglioti, 1997; Graybiel, 1995). Regions of the striatum participate in dense cortico-subcortical feedback loops and exchange neural activity through dense connections with adjacent basal ganglia structures as well as the thalamus (Aglioti, 1997; Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Shine, 2021). Associating macroscopic changes in manifold eccentricity with post-mortem microarray data provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2013), we identified gene sets expressed in cortical regions and subcortical structures of the thalamus and striatum during late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Despite these findings being associative and based on separate datasets, they overall support our results that brain network maturation from late childhood until early adulthood implicates micro- and macroscale factors in both subcortical and cortical networks. Coupled network and molecular changes may ultimately change subcortical and cortical circuit properties, including the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Human brain development involves spatio-temporal waves of gene expression changes across different brain regions and developmental time windows (Ip et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2018). In the study of adolescent development, prior studies have suggested shifts in E/I balance, evolving from a dominant inhibitory bias in early developmental stages towards stronger excitatory drive in later stages, and suggested that these may underlie the maturation of cognitive functions such as working memory and executive control (Dorrn et al., 2010; Lander et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2007). In common neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, imbalances in cortical E/I and cortico-subcortical network function have been demonstrated (Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Gandal et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2005; Nelson and Valakh, 2015; Park et al., 2021a; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Trakoshis et al., 2020), potentially downstream to perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems, such as interneuron-mediated GABA transmission (Bonaventura et al., 2017; Kilb, 2012; Liu et al., 2007; Park et al., 2021a; Silveri et al., 2013; Trakoshis et al., 2020; Tziortzi et al., 2014)."

"1180" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Higher-order cognitive function implicates functionally relevant whole-brain network mechanisms, and its prediction may thus leverage structurally governed principles of network integration and segregation. Application of a supervised machine learning framework with cross-validation and regularization to our cohort demonstrated that it is possible to predict inter-individual variations in future IQ from structural connectome manifold data. These findings complement conceptual accounts linking brain organization to cognitive function (Margulies et al., 2016; Mesulam, 1998) and earlier efforts to predict IQ measures from inter-regional measures of connectivity and graph-theoretical indices of network topology (Greene et al., 2018). Notably, evaluations of several feature combinations highlighted that predictive performance was highest when including both baseline and trajectory data, and when complementing cortical and subcortical manifold features. These findings re-emphasize the benefits of incorporating subcortical nodes in the characterization of large-scale cortical network organization and overall cognitive function (Alves et al., 2019; Müller et al., 2020; Shine, 2021; Shine et al., 2019). Of note, although our model significantly outperformed a baseline model, the relationship between the actual and predicted IQ scores did not locate on the equality line and the strength of the association was rather weak.

On the other hand, adolescence is also a sensitive time window for risk taking, the development of addictions, and is associated with high rates of onset of several psychiatric disorders (Hong et al., 2019; Khundrakpam et al., 2017). Our study has shown that structural brain network organization continues to mature significantly during this time period, with higher-order association cortices in prefrontal and posterior regions especially showing an expansion of their corresponding connectome manifold signature. Findings were related to an increased strengthening of intra-community connectivity as well as cortico-subcortical connectivity to thalamo-striatal regions.

Gradient nonlinearity and b0 distortion correction, non-brain tissue removal, and intensity normalization were performed. The white matter and pial surfaces were generated by following the boundaries between different tissues (Dale et al., 1999), and they were averaged to generate the midthickness contour, which was used to generate the inflated surface. The spherical surface was registered to the Conte69 template with 164k vertices (Van Essen et al., 2012) and downsampled to a 32k vertex mesh. Quality control involved visual inspection of surface reconstruction of T1-weighted data, and cases with faulty cortical segmentation were excluded. Surface-based co-registration between T1-weighted and MT weighted scans was performed. We generated 14 equivolumetric cortical surfaces within the cortex and sampled MT intensity along these surfaces (Paquola et al., 2019a). The vertex-wise MT profiles for each surface depth were averaged based on the Schaefer atlas with 200 parcels (Schaefer et al., 2018). The dMRI data were processed using MRtrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019), including correction for susceptibility distortions, head motion, and eddy currents.

"1185" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Structural connectomes were generated from preprocessed dMRI data (Tournier et al., 2019). Anatomically constrained tractography was performed using different tissue types derived from the T1-weighted image, including cortical and subcortical gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (Smith et al., 2012). Multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions were estimated (Christiaens et al., 2015), and constrained spherical-deconvolution and intensity normalization were performed (Jeurissen et al., 2014). The tractogram was generated with 40 million streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. Subsequently, spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) was applied to reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by the cross-section multipliers, which considers the fiber bundle’s total intra-axonal space across its full cross-sectional extent (Smith et al., 2015). The structural connectome was built by mapping the reconstructed cross-section streamlines onto the Schaefer 7-network based atlas with 200 parcels (Schaefer et al., 2018) then log-transformed to adjust for the scale (Fornito et al., 2016). We opted for this atlas as it (i) allows contextualization of our findings within macroscale intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), (ii) incorporates the option to assess results across different granularities, and (iii) aligns the current study with previous work from our group (Benkarim et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021b; Park et al., 2021a; Rodríguez-Cruces et al., 2020) and others (Baum et al., 2020; Betzel et al., 2019; Osmanlıoğlu et al., 2019)." "elife"
"1186" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "Cortex-wide structural connectome manifolds were identified using BrainSpace (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). First, a template manifold was estimated using a group representative structural connectome of the template dataset. The group representative structural connectome was defined using a distance-dependent thresholding that preserves long-range connections (Betzel et al., 2019). An affinity matrix was constructed with a normalized angle kernel, and eigenvectors were estimated via diffusion map embedding (Figure 1A), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman and Lafon, 2006) that projects connectome features into low-dimensional manifolds (Margulies et al., 2016). This technique is only controlled by a few parameters, computationally efficient, and relatively robust to noise compared to other nonlinear techniques (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000), and has been extensively used in the previous gradient mapping literature (Hong et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2020; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020a; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019a; Park et al., 2021b; Valk et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). It is controlled by two parameters α and t, where α controls the influence of the density of sampling points on the manifold (α = 0, maximal influence; α = 1, no influence) and t controls the scale of eigenvalues of the diffusion operator. We set α = 0.5 and t = 0 to retain the global relations between data points in the embedded space, following prior applications (Hong et al., 2019; Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019a; Paquola et al., 2019b; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). Briefly, the eigenvectors estimated from the decomposition technique generate a connectivity coordinate system (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018) – the diffusion map, where Euclidean distances in the manifold correspond to diffusion times between the nodes of the network (Coifman and Lafon, 2006). In this manifold space, interconnected brain regions with similar connectivity patterns are closely located, and regions with weak similarity in connectivity patterns are located farther apart. After generating the template manifold, individual-level manifolds were estimated from the non-template dataset and aligned to the template manifold via Procrustes alignment (Langs et al., 2015; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). To analyze change in the low-dimensional manifold space, we simplified the multivariate eigenvectors into a single scalar value that is., manifold eccentricity (Figure 1B). Manifold eccentricity was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the manifold origin and all data points (i.e., brain regions) in manifold space. The template center was defined as the centroid of the first three eigenvectors, which explained 50% variance. Specifically, manifold eccentricity was defined as follows:(1)CT=1N∑i=1NTE1i,∑i=1NTE2i,∑i=1NTE3i(2)ME=∑e=13IEe-CTe2" "elife"
"1187" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "CT is the template manifold origin, N the number of brain regions, T∙ the template manifold, ME the manifold eccentricity, I∙ the individual manifold, and CTe the origin of e-th template manifold. Simply, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 15, each brain region (i.e., each dot in the scatter plot) is described as a vector from the manifold origin (i.e., triangular mark in the scatter plot), and manifold eccentricity is simply a length (i.e., Euclidean distance) of that vector. Shifts in connectivity patterns of a given region thus will lead to shifts in the vectors, which in turn changes the manifold eccentricity. Thus, manifold eccentricity quantifies global brain organization based in the connectivity space." "elife"
"1188" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "We assessed changes in manifold eccentricity across age using a linear mixed effect model (Worsley et al., 2009), controlling for effects of sex, site, head motion, and subject-specific random intercept to improve model fit in accelerated longitudinal designs. The t-statistics of each brain region were computed, and we corrected for multiple comparisons by using an FDR threshold of q < 0.05 (Figure 1C; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We stratified age-related effects based on a seminal model of neural organization and laminar differentiation that contains four cortical hierarchical levels (Mesulam, 1998), as well as seven intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011; Figure 1D). To assess the effects with respect to age2, we repeated implementing a linear mixed effect model by adding a quadratic term of age to the model." "elife"
"1189" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "To provide the underlying structure of manifold eccentricity, we compared the changes in manifold eccentricity with those in connectome topology measures. We first defined clusters within the identified regions based on their spatial boundaries (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Then, we calculated degree centrality, as well as modular measures of within-module degree and participation coefficient using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) and connectivity distance using a recently published approach (Larivière et al., 2020b). Degree centrality is defined as the row-wise sum of the weighted connectivity matrix, representing the connection strength of a given node (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Connectivity distance is a given brain region’s geodesic distance to its structurally connected brain areas within the cortex (Oligschläger et al., 2019), and it is defined as the multiplication between the geodesic distance and the binarized structural connectome (Hong et al., 2019; Oligschläger et al., 2019). Within-module degree and participation coefficient are nodal measures reflecting different facets of community organization (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). For each individual subject, community structure was defined using Louvain’s algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) and a consistency matrix was constructed, where each element of the matrix represents whether the two different nodes are involved in the same community (i.e., 1) or not (i.e., 0) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). We constructed the group-wise consistency matrix by averaging the consistency matrix of all subjects and applied k-means clustering (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The optimal number of clusters was determined using the silhouette coefficient, that is, the k that maximized the silhouette coefficient (Kannan et al., 2010). We calculated within-module degree and participation coefficient based on these modules. Within-module degree is the degree centrality within a community, indicating intra-community connection strength, while participation coefficient represents inter-community connectivity (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). We calculated linear correlations between changes in manifold eccentricity and those in each graph-theoretical measure for each cluster (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). The significance of the correlation was corrected using 1000 permutation tests by randomly shuffling subject indices in one of the data vectors, and we corrected for multiple comparisons across clusters using an FDR procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). To visualize age-related changes in these parameters, we stratified each measure according to discretized age bins (<17, 17–19, 19–21, 21–23, ≥23; Figure 1—figure supplement 3)." "elife"
"1190" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "It has been shown that macroscale cortical morphology and microstructure significantly change during development (Gogtay et al., 2004; Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Paquola et al., 2019a; Shaw et al., 2006). Here, we confirmed these changes by assessing age-related changes in MRI-based cortical thickness measures and intracortical measures of MT, an index sensitive to myelin content (Weiskopf et al., 2013), using linear mixed effect models (Figure 2A; Worsley et al., 2009). We further regressed out cortical thickness and MT from the connectome manifold eccentricity metric. We then implemented linear mixed effect models using the residuals of manifold measures to assess whether age-related connectome manifold effects exist above and beyond age-related effects on cortical morphology and microstructure (Figure 2B)."

"1191" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "To assess age-related changes in subcortical manifold organizations in addition to cortical manifold structures, we first parcellated the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus for each individual (Patenaude et al., 2011), and approximated cross-sectionl streamlines connect each subcortical region to the rest of the brain. For each individual and each subcortical region, we projected the streamline strength to cortical manifold space by weighting the cortical manifolds with the streamline strength of the connection between each subcortical region and cortical parcels, yielding a matrix with the form of (number of brain regions × number of cortical manifolds). We averaged the matrix across the axis of cortical manifolds to construct subcortical-weighted manifold vector. We assessed age-related changes in the subcortical-weighted manifold using a linear mixed effect model (Worsley et al., 2009), controlling for sex, site, head motion, and subject-specific random intercept, and FDR corrected for multiple comparisons (Figure 3; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)." "elife"
"1192" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "We performed spatial correlation analysis to post-mortem gene expression data and carried out a developmental enrichment analysis (Figure 4). In brief, we first correlated the t-statistics map, which represents age-related changes in manifold eccentricity that controlled for cortical morphology and microstructure, with the post-mortem gene expression maps provided by the Allen Institute using the Neurovault gene decoding tool (Gorgolewski et al., 2015; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2012). Leveraging mixed effect models to associate the input t-statistic map with the genes of six donor brains, Neurovault yields the gene symbols associated with the input spatial map. Gene symbols that passed for a significance level of FDR < 0.05 were further tested whether they are consistently expressed across different donors using abagen toolbox (Markello et al., 2020; copy archived at https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen; Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2012). For each gene, we estimated whole-brain gene expression map and correlated it between all pairs of donors. Leveraging CSEA developmental expression tool (http://genetics.wustl.edu/jdlab/csea-tool-2; Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014), we evaluated the significance of overlap between the genes showing consistent whole-brain expression pattern across donors (FDR < 0.05) with RNAseq data obtained from BrainSpan dataset (http://www.brainspan.org). The significance was calculated based on Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922) with FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The CSEA tool provides simplified results of gene enrichment profiles along six major brain regions (i.e., cortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala) across 10 developmental periods (from early fetal to young adulthood) approximated from mouse data, yielding a total of 60 combinations of developmental enrichment profiles (Xu et al., 2014). We repeated developmental enrichment analysis using the genes identified from the rotated maps of the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (100 spherical rotations). For each iteration, we obtained developmental expression profiles using the identified genes, where the FDR-corrected p-values built a null distribution. For each brain division and developmental period, if the actual p-value is placed outside 95% of the null distribution, it was deemed significant. As the Allen Brain Institute repository is composed of adult post-mortem datasets, it should be noted that the associated gene symbols represent indirect associations with the input t-statistic map derived from the developmental data."

Four different feature sets were evaluated: (i) manifold eccentricity of the identified cortical regions at baseline and (ii) manifold eccentricity at baseline and its longitudinal change (i.e., differences between follow-up and baseline), and (iii) cortical manifold eccentricity and subcortical-weighted manifold of the identified regions at baseline and (iv) manifold eccentricity and subcortical-weighted manifold at baseline and their longitudinal changes. For each evaluation, a subset of features that could predict future IQ was identified using elastic net regularization (ρ=0.5) with optimized regularization parameters (L1 and L2 penalty terms) via nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005). We split the dataset into training (9/10) and test (1/10) partitions, and each training partition was further split into inner training and testing folds using another ten-fold cross-validation. Within the inner fold, elastic net regularization finds a set of non-redundant features to explain the dependent variable. Using a linear regression, we predicted the IQ scores of inner fold test data using the features of the selected brain regions by controlling for age, sex, site, and head motion. The model with minimum MAE across the inner folds was applied to the test partition of the outer fold, and the IQ scores of outer fold test data were predicted. The prediction procedure was repeated 100 times with different training and test sets to reduce subject selection bias. Prediction accuracy was indexed by computing linear correlations between the actual and predicted IQ scores as well as MAE. A 95% confidence interval of the accuracy measures was also reported. Permutation-based correlations across 1000 tests were conducted by randomly shuffling subject indices to check whether the prediction performance exceeded chance levels. To assess whether our model outperforms baseline model, we predicted IQ of test data using average of IQ of training data (i.e., predicted IQ = mean(training set IQ)). The improvement of prediction performance was assessed using Meng’s z-test (Meng et al., 1992).

Recently established resources, such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2015), can be utilized to spatially associate macroscale imaging/connectome data with the expression patterns of thousands of genes. These findings have already been applied in the study of healthy adults (Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Park et al., 2020b; Q. Xu et al., 2020) and typically developing adolescents (Mascarell Maričić et al., 2020; Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014; Paquola et al., 2019a; Vértes et al., 2016; Whitaker et al., 2016), as well as individuals suffering from prevalent brain disorders (Altmann et al., 2018; Hashimoto et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020a; Patel et al., 2021; Romero-Garcia et al., 2019). The gene sets that co-vary with in vivo findings can furthermore be subjected to gene set enrichment analyses to discover potentially implicated molecular, cellular, and pathological processes (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2013; Dougherty et al., 2010; Kuleshov et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2019; Romero-Garcia et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2005). For example, studies in newborns have shown that cortical morphology reflects spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in foetuses, linking molecular mechanisms to in vivo measures of cortical development in early life (Ball et al., 2020). Work in adolescents has furthermore shown that developmental changes in regional cortical thickness measures and myelin proxies spatially co-localize with the expression patterns of genes involved in synaptic and oligodendroglial function (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016). Building on these prior investigations, the current study aimed at exploring whether adolescent structural connectome reconfigurations, assessed using manifold learning techniques, reflect the expression patterns of specific genes, in order to identify potential molecular signatures of macroscale structural network development.”" "elife"

Despite these findings being associative and based on separate datasets, they overall support our results that brain network maturation from late childhood until early adulthood implicates micro- and macroscale factors in both subcortical and cortical networks. Coupled network and molecular changes may ultimately change subcortical and cortical circuit properties, including the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Human brain development involves spatio-temporal waves of gene expression changes across different brain regions and developmental time windows (Ip et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2018). In the study of adolescent development, prior studies have suggested shifts in E/I balance, evolving from a dominant inhibitory bias in early developmental stages towards stronger excitatory drive in later stages, and suggested that these may underlie the maturation of cognitive functions such as working memory and executive control (Dorrn et al., 2010; Lander et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2007). In common neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, imbalances in cortical E/I and cortico-subcortical network function have been demonstrated (Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Gandal et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2005; Nelson and Valakh, 2015; Park et al., 2020a; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Trakoshis et al., 2020), potentially downstream to perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems, such as interneuron-mediated GABA transmission (Bonaventura et al., 2017; Kilb, 2012; Liu et al., 2007; Park et al., 2020a; Silveri et al., 2013; Trakoshis et al., 2020; Tziortzi et al., 2014).”" "elife"

"elife"
"1284" "10.7554/eLife.64694" "We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work and happy to provide further rationale for the use of gradients. Being derived from connectomes, we agree that gradient mapping techniques do, in part, recapitulate findings that have been previously shown with more established techniques, for example, graph-theoretical analyses that consider the brain as a graph with nodes and edges and estimate connectome patterns by calculating graph parameters, such as centrality and modular measures (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). However, we believe that gradient mapping approaches offer a promising combination of methodological and conceptual properties: (i) Gradient mapping based on manifold learning approaches reduce high dimensional (i.e., n x n) connectomes into a series of k spatial maps (i.e., gradients, each of the form n x 1) in a data-driven way and thus provide a simplified view on large-scale connectome organization. Of note, the dimensionality reduction procedure we opted for (i.e., diffusion map embedding) is computationally efficient and robust to noise when computing a globally optimal solution compared to linear approaches (Tenenbaum et al., 2000). (ii) As in the current work, the solution of these techniques is not necessarily a single gradient, but it can be multiple, potentially overlapping gradients. Representing multiple gradients has been suggested to offer the ability to characterize both subregional heterogeneity and functional multiplicity of brain regions (Haak and Beckmann, 2020). In prior work, we showed that the use of multiple diffusion MRI gradients can help to better understand dynamic functional communication patterns in the adult human brain connectome (Park et al., 2021). (iii) As the gradients derived from these techniques can serve as continuous axes of cortical organization, the use of several gradients jointly allows to generate intrinsic coordinate systems in connectivity space, in line with prior conceptual accounts (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018). (iv) In addition to the aforementioned methodological advances, prior work has shown that principal gradients, e.g., those estimated from task-free functional MRI (Margulies et al., 2016), follow established models of cortical hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998). These observations have allowed gradient mapping approaches to make conceptual contact with seminal work on cortical organization, evolution, and development (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969, 1962).

In addition to ensuring continuity with these prior studies, non-linear techniques do in general explain more information with the same number of components than linear techniques, which may increase performance on group classification, cluster identification, and phenotypic score prediction (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020). Diffusion map embedding, in particular, is only controlled by few parameters, and thus computationally efficient and rather robust to noise (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000). Of note, the non-linearity is simply introduced by running the singular value decomposition, which is also at the heart of PCA, on the Markov matrix of the normalized connectome, which also lends a direct interpretation to the reduced manifold as being interpretable as a ‘diffusion map’ between the nodes."

In brief, both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques compress high dimensional connectome data (n x n) into a series of lower-dimensional eigenvectors (i.e., gradients, each of the form n x 1), offering a synoptic view on connectome development. In our case, we used these manifold learning techniques to derive a three-dimensional connectivity space to which we were able to sensitively track developmental changes in adolescence. Beyond these methodological considerations, prior work has shown that principal gradients estimated from task-free functional (Margulies et al., 2016), microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b), and diffusion MRI (Park et al., 2020a) broadly converge along an established model of sensory-fugal neural hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998), allowing the gradient mapping approach to align with theories of cortical organization and evolution (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969, 1962).

Of note, diffusion map embedding is analytically straightforward, as it simply performs a singular value decomposition on the Markov matrix, which can be readily interpreted as a diffusion process throughout the connectome. Researchers have previously adopted both linear (Hong et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2019; Shine et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020) and non-linear techniques (Guell et al., 2018; Haak and Beckmann, 2020; Hong et al., 2019; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019b, 2019a; Sofie L.

Notably, in this manifold space, interconnected brain regions with similar connectivity patterns are closer together, while regions that do not have significant connectivity nor similarity in connectivity patterns are located farther apart. In our work, the specific space is a diffusion map, where Euclidean distances in the manifold correspond to diffusion times between the nodes of the network. To analyze how the multi-dimensional manifold structures change in the low dimensional manifold space, we simplified the multivariate eigenvectors into a single scalar value i.e., manifold eccentricity. Manifold eccentricity was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the manifold origin and all data points (i.e., brain regions) in manifold space. For example, using three eigenvectors, manifold eccentricity was defined as follows:CT is the template manifold origin; N number of brain regions; T(•) template manifold; ME manifold eccentricity; I(•) individual manifold; CT(e) origin of eth template manifold. This concept is visualized in Figure 1—figure supplement 15. Each brain region (i.e., each dot in the scatter plot) is described as a vector from the manifold origin (i.e., triangular mark in the scatter plot), and manifold eccentricity is simply a length (i.e., Euclidean distance) of that vector. Shifts in connectivity patterns of a given region thus will lead to shifts in the vectors, which in turn changes the manifold eccentricity.

The use of gold standard measures for specific psychiatric symptoms, such as the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) [11] or the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) [12, 13] as single outcome measures is also problematic because they only capture specific symptom clusters and their use may result in both an over- or underestimation of treatment responders [4, 14].

We examined the correspondence between clinician, parent and child measures of global symptom severity, adaptive functioning and specific psychiatric symptoms. This is critical because it is still unclear how to best measure the complex symptom presentation of the syndrome. Using the appropriate outcome measures has important implications for both clinical practice and the design of clinical trials." "biomed_central"
"1458" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Overall, median ratings for measures assessing global symptom severity and adaptive functioning indicated low symptom burden and a rather high level of everyday functioning in our sample. However, there was a large variability in the data, particularly in the symptom-specific measures, reflecting the heterogeneity of symptom presentations and clinical courses that are characteristic of the syndrome. These findings confirm and extend the findings of our previous study on the same cohort [5]. Specifically, we had previously reported that approximately one third of participants in the follow-up study had clinically significant symptoms and required additional treatment." "biomed_central"
"1459" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "CGI-S is a gold standard measure of psychiatric illness severity, most frequently assessed by the clinician.

Overall, agreement between ratings made by parent and child were excellent for functional scales, but only fair-to-moderate for global symptom severity and symptom-specific scales, with the exception of the separation anxiety measure, which had excellent agreement between informants." "biomed_central"
"1460" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "As expected, because of the previously mentioned heterogeneity of symptom presentations, global clinician-rated symptom and functional measures tended to have stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than with symptom-specific ones."

Despite both scales being useful in the study, KIDSCREEN-10 may be more easily accessible to a younger patient group. Multiple parents commented on the suitability of the WSAS-P/Y, and indicated that its items may be less suitable for the younger patients. By contrast, the KIDSCREEN-10 was perceived as simple and straightforward for both younger children and teenagers." "biomed_central"
"1462" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Somewhat surprisingly, SDQ-P/S seemed to have weak inter-correlations with global symptom and functional scales and the agreement between informants was only moderate. This may be due to SDQ-P/S being more symptom-oriented than the other global measures used in the study. Results suggest that it may be less clinically useful in this particular patient group, but it should also be noted that the SDQ impact supplement was not used and therefore is not included in our analyses."

"1463" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are part of main PANS criteria but were surprisingly rare in our sample at follow-up. Assessing obsessive-compulsive symptoms with a self-rated scale as a complement to CY-BOCS may not add a lot of information within the PANS patient group at follow-up. At onset, OCD is generally a more pervasive part of the symptom presentation, and more time should be devoted to a comprehensive OCD assessment." "biomed_central"
"1464" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "We did not include a measure specifically measuring eating disorder symptoms because, in our clinical experience, these tend to be OCD-related and without the defining features of a typical eating disorder such as fears of gaining weight (resembling avoidant/restrictive food avoidance disorder). For selected patients with eating difficulties, it may be useful to measure these symptoms in order to track their improvement." "biomed_central"
"1465" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "The agreement between SMFQ-P/C ratings made by parent and child was only fair, indicating the importance of having both parent- and child ratings of depression and thus avoid underestimating these symptoms in PANS patients. Conversely, the agreement between SAAI-P/C ratings made by parent and patient was excellent, suggesting that either parent or child ratings may suffice for clinical purposes." "biomed_central"
"1466" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Previous longitudinal data have shown a high comorbidity with neuropsychiatric disorders, combined with intensification of related symptoms during PANS flares [5, 45]. We therefore recommend measures that can screen for, and assess the severity of, autistic behaviors, inattention, hyperactivity and conduct problems when following up PANS. In our sample ECBI had a very strong association to SNAP-IV, suggesting that the simpler SNAP-IV may sufficiently cover the patients’ oppositional behaviors for clinical purposes. When detecting potentially severe oppositional defiant behaviors, ECBI can be used as a complement." "biomed_central"
"1467" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Our study has some limitations. First, we analyzed data from a small sample of patients from a single clinic. Second, the age range was such that the results of the child-rated measures should be interpreted with caution; despite our efforts, it is possible that the younger children received help from their parents to fill in their questionnaires. Third, we were not able to calculate internal consistency of the scales included in this study (only total scores were available). We could thus not examine the psychometric properties of the scales in this particular sample. Future studies would benefit from conducting such psychometric analyses." "biomed_central"
"1468" "10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5" "Clinical experience and the results from our follow-up study suggest that it is important to include clinician-, parent- and child ratings in the assessment of PANS, as a single perspective is unlikely to capture the full complexity of the syndrome. Brief, general measures assessing global disease severity and adaptive functioning, are clinically helpful and should be used but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of the core symptoms in PANS, such as OCD, anxiety, depression and behavioral problems. However, their exclusive use is problematic as the natural course of the syndrome is such that some patients may not have specific symptoms to rate at follow-up. Furthermore, it is important that the assessment is straightforward and as brief as possible. Based on our experience, we recommend the use of a core battery of clinician-, parent- and child-rated measures in both clinical practice and in clinical trials (Table 7). The proposed core battery of measures will provide a broad evaluation of PANS-related symptoms, but can be complemented with further symptom-specific measures when needed.

Neuroimmunology represents a rapidly expanding area of research with a high potential to improve human health, catalysed by increasing evidence implicating the immune system in neurological and psychiatric development and disorders and, conversely, the role of the nervous system in modifying immune function. These interactions are dynamic and diverse, ranging from health and homeostasis, across the lifespan, from development to old age and during disease. Closing the gap in our knowledge will increase our fundamental understanding of communication between two complex systems and how neuroimmune interactions change over time, how they influence our behaviour and what happens in neurological and psychiatric disorders." "f1000research"
"1487" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Progress towards realising the translational potential of neuroimmunology has, at times, been hindered by gaps in basic mechanistic understanding and limited tools to monitor, measure and modulate cells and molecules of the central nervous system (CNS). Better understanding of the multiple interactions between cell types of the nervous and immune systems is required, both within the CNS and the periphery. Furthermore, the role of cells at the interface of the two systems, such as border-associated macrophages and immune cells that reside or circulate within and beyond the CNS, is becoming increasingly appreciated. This highlights the importance of understanding dynamic neuroimmune interactions in the broadest sense. It is important to consider when and where these interactions are biologically advantageous or dysfunctional. For example, microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages and most abundant immunological cell type in the CNS, play a vital role in supporting healthy nervous system development and homeostasis; however, they can also contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction/degeneration, depending on the context

Identifying the key scientific questions can help a community galvanise around a common set of goals and facilitate the formation of new collaborations." "f1000research"
"1490" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "To accomplish this, and building off of earlier discussions
8, in October 2020, Wellcome brought together some of the leading neuroimmunology researchers in the UK, from across a range of institutions, career stages and clinical and scientific backgrounds. Members of the steering committee can be found in
Table 1. The goal was to identify questions that, if addressed, would deliver a step change in our understanding in the short and medium term (five to 10 years) and, in turn, have a positive impact on human health. It was important that these questions were generated by the research community, with the greatest potential to maximise basic understanding and therapeutic advances, without being influenced by other factors or strategies. The aim was to focus on the key questions that would have the broadest and most immediate impact, and that would be comprehensive and inclusive for the whole neuroimmunology community while still providing meaningful and tangible scientific direction." "f1000research"
"1491" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "To this end, the scope for this exercise covered fundamental biology through to clinical application, in both health (for instance, homeostasis, development, healthy aging and behaviour) and disease (such as dementia, multiple sclerosis, depression and schizophrenia). Broad definitions of the nervous and immune systems were maintained. The nervous system would include: neuronal synapses and surrounding glia, specific brain, spinal cord or retinal compartments, the peripheral nervous system and the cerebrospinal fluid. The immune system would include both the peripheral and CNS-resident innate and adaptive immune systems, and those at the interface with the nervous system, including cells associated with the blood brain barrier. In addition, it was considered important to be inclusive in language and terminology, whilst being able to communicate across diverse fields. Throughout, we refer to neuroimmunology as encompassing the full range of the two systems, from molecular and cellular interactions, through to immunopsychiatry and psychoneuroimmunology, thus inclusive of mind, brain and environment interactions."

"1492" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "A conscious decision was made to be disease-agnostic when setting the research questions, while recognising the importance of the clinical context, as discussed in detail later. As such, persons with lived experience were not included at this stage of the process, although we recognise their future participation is essential when setting priorities for specific conditions." "f1000research"
"1493" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "By engaging with a broad spectrum of stakeholders in an open and transparent process, the following research priorities were identified collectively (
Figure 1)." "f1000research"
"1494" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Ten key research questions were identified which, if addressed, would drive the field forward in the short to medium term and translate to a positive impact on human health. The ten questions can broadly be grouped into three categories reflecting the scale of analysis (e.g. molecules, circuits) and internal and external factors that influence, or are influenced by, neuroimmune interactions. Each of these questions will need to be addressed in the relevant contexts including across the lifespan and in health and disease, and may require the development or adoption of new tools and technologies to be successful. Addressing these questions will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base and ultimately drive translation (e.g. through identification of new targets, biomarkers)." "f1000research"
"1495" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Aiming to keep the research priorities broad and applicable to the diverse researchers in the field, four cross-cutting themes were discussed that provide additional context to each question: bi-directional communication, context, translation and tool/technology development." "f1000research"
"1496" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Interactions between the immune and nervous systems are bidirectional and both the neuroimmune and immune-neuro perspectives should be considered when addressing the research questions." "f1000research"
"1497" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "For example, in the immune-to-neuro direction, the presence of immune cells in the CNS was once considered a sign of neuropathology, but it is now increasingly recognised that immune signalling in the CNS is important for normal development and healthy brain function. The formation of mature neural circuits for example requires pruning of synapses by the immune system, including the classical complement pathway (initiated by C1q)
9, microglia
10 and MHC Class I
11. By extension, inappropriate activation of the immune system can lead to excessive synapse loss and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s Disease
12. This fine balance of immune function in the CNS is further demonstrated by the ability of antigen-specific T cells to improve neuronal survival after a CNS injury
13." "f1000research"
"1498" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "In pathological states, such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and autoantibody-mediated neurological conditions, immune function is unequivocally involved in neuroinflammatory damage and/or pain but, paradoxically, can also support tissue regeneration (e.g. remyelination). Inflammation can also play a role in other states and conditions, such as stress resilience and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Immune-deficient mice (severe combined immunodeficiency and nude mice) were more likely to develop PTSD than wildtype mice when subjected to stress, with improvements seen in the stress response upon transfer of T cells from wildtype donors
13. Further roles are also proposed for T cells in learning memory and behaviour, in both antigen-specific and antigen-independent manners
13." "f1000research"
"1499" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "When considering areas to prioritise, it was noted that strategies modulating the immune system to improve neurological or behavioural function are more developed than vice versa. As such, these are perhaps more likely to be taken forward in the medium term for a variety of reasons, e.g. due to challenges in developing brain penetrant drugs. However, we fully acknowledge the importance of psychological, behavioural and physical interventions that act via the nervous system to modulate immune function and their potential to be harnessed for therapeutic benefit. It has been recognised that the modulation of neural function plays a role in regulating immune responses, for example as seen in the gut-brain axis as well as strategies to modulate neurotransmitters or neuropeptides to influence health
14,
15. The immune system is also susceptible to behavioural conditioning whereby pairing of a novel aversive taste stimulus (conditioned stimulus) with an immunosuppressive drug e.g. cyclosporin (unconditioned stimulus) results in the taste stimulus itself exerting immunosuppressive properties
16,
17. Proof-of-principle data suggest that a similar behavioural conditioning approach may support an immunosuppressive drug dose-reduction strategy in renal transplant patients
18." "f1000research"
"1500" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Activation of both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated to affect the immune system both directly and indirectly. For example, lymphocytes express surface receptors for neurohormones and transmitters and are exposed to neurochemicals in lymphoid organs including the spleen and in peripheral blood. Indeed, directly activating dopaminergic neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area and characterizing the subsequent immune response after exposure to
Escherichia coli has shown an increase in both innate and adaptive immune responses
19. This was indexed by enhanced antibacterial activity of monocytes and macrophages, reduced bacterial load and a heightened T cell response in a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity
19." "f1000research"
"1501" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Thus, studying both neuroimmune and immune-neuro interactions will be critical to providing a holistic mechanistic understanding of these pathways that will ultimately form the foundations for innovative interventions. Furthermore, these established CNS-immune communication pathways demonstrate the potential of psychological/psycho-social interventions to improve immune health and the importance of thinking more broadly, i.e. beyond pharmacological modulators, about how neuroimmunology could inform strategies to support health." "f1000research"
"1502" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Understanding the context of neuroimmune cross-talk is critical when considering the underlying mechanisms. When tackling these priorities, research teams should carefully consider and report the rationale behind the chosen experimental context(s). For example, localisation (e.g. a specific brain region or peripheral nerve terminal), age or developmental stage, and/or health or disease setting, including relapse and remission. The context itself could define which research questions are a priority to address first, or which cell types to investigate and how. For example, studying a particular cell type might be most appropriate within a specific disease setting or developmental stage." "f1000research"
"1503" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Investigating neuroimmune relationships during homeostasis and development from pregnancy and early life through to ageing will provide significant mechanistic insights into the interactions. While the intent of the discussion was to be broadly disease-agnostic, defining where and how disease is included in the investigations was recognised to be important. The disease context has the potential to provide fundamental insights for certain common phenotypes across multiple diseases, both with relevance to aetiology of disease onset, persistence and progression. For example, insight into brain development can give significant clues into mechanisms that can be reactivated in disease (for example synaptic elimination). Indeed, neuroinflammation is beneficial in the right context and so improving our understanding of when it switches from being beneficial (e.g. instructing developmental processes, removing debris, fighting infection, promoting regeneration) to detrimental (e.g. potential maladaptive synaptic pruning, failure to sense danger, uncontrolled inflammation) to neurological health, is required. Failure to consider different contexts could lead to the unintended exclusion of important areas and overlooking of key mechanisms, for instance natural changes in neuroimmune cross-talk during critical periods of development and ageing." "f1000research"
"1504" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Contextual elements that should be considered include the effect of genetic background, risk factors and co-morbidities (e.g. metabolic disorders and obesity, or chronic low-grade infection and changes in the microbiome), all of which can lead to chronic inflammation and an impact on the nervous system, and predate disorders such as psychosis or depression
20. The influence of sleep and changes in neuroendocrine signalling (including glucocorticoids, androgens, oestrogens, neuropeptides and other hormones) and the impact of therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions (such as chemotherapy, immunomodulation or analgesics) are also important considerations. The impact of diversity on neuroimmune interactions, including sex and ethnicity, will also be important in gaining real understanding of the nuances of these interactions. Secondary influences, such as environmental factors, pollution, exercise, epidemics, therapeutics, poverty or stress, are increasingly recognised as playing important roles in shaping these interactions. As well as encouraging new epidemiological studies, the impact of societal factors opens the way for new collaborations with experts in the social sciences, further breaking down traditional academic siloes. While the impact of acute and chronic infection was not addressed directly when developing the priorities, infection and neuroimmune interactions are inherently linked e.g. in the maternal-immune activation model, where prenatal exposure to infection could be a driver in initiating depression or psychosis in later life, or chronic gum disease as a driver of dementia
21." "f1000research"
"1505" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "In summary, whilst reductionist and mechanistic experimental studies are pivotal, the impact of neuroimmune interactions cannot be studied in isolation, and the broader context of these interactions, be it co-morbidities, age, chronic stress or infection, need to be taken into consideration (and reported) when trying to understand the roles and functions of these interactions over time. This can add a level of complexity but is critical in providing a complete understanding." "f1000research"
"1506" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Addressing some of the priority questions fully will require development of new tools and technologies. While there have been major advances in recent years, there will be an increasing need to continue to develop sensitive and selective tools to measure and modulate immune cells and molecules
in vivo, particularly within the CNS. This applies to both human and animal models to study interactions in homeostasis and development as well as in disorders, where a lack of suitable tools often presents a major barrier to progress. For instance, being able to image and modulate CNS-resident or CNS-infiltrating immune cells and pathways in the living nervous system, without affecting the peripheral immune system, would be game changing, allowing questions to be asked that are not currently addressable around the dynamics of these cells and pathways
in vivo. Genetic tools, robust target-specific monoclonal antibodies, novel biological labels and synthetic biology may all contribute to the new toolbox." "f1000research"
"1507" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Analysis of the full repertoire of immune cells and molecules resident in the brain and nervous system will greatly benefit from the generation of detailed cell atlases that incorporate study of the peripheral immune system. This, however, may require development of new or more specific markers to study the different immune cell types in the first instance, and then progress to specific tools to track and manipulate cellular behaviour. The migratory nature and dynamic aspects of cell phenotypes of the immune compartment may provide additional challenges to cell atlas development." "f1000research"
"1508" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Collaborations beyond the biological sciences could be one way forward to develop or optimise these much-needed methods and tools. For example, working with medical physicists to develop neuroimaging tools sensitive to discrete CNS immune cell types or with bioengineers to develop cell type-specific targeting vehicles that could deliver pharmacological modulators directly to cells of interest, would be transformative from both a discovery and clinical perspective. Computational approaches are equally needed in order to integrate and analyse the large amount of clinical and basic research data generated and develop hypotheses for further experimental testing. This includes neuroimaging and biomarker data, eHealth records and the outputs from large scale ‘omics approaches." "f1000research"
"1509" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Dissecting fundamental questions of neuroimmune interactions, such as those proposed here, can lead to an improved understanding of both systems and how disordered interactions can be potentially causal in major neurological disorders and mental illnesses. Increasing translational potential requires investigating changes in neuronal circuitry, synaptic plasticity, CNS development and ageing, and homeostasis and (dys)function in both human and model systems. Studying effects of immune-modulating therapies on the nervous system, behaviour, and psychopathology can help to elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms, leading to development of novel or repurposed immunotherapies. Progress in this area has been greatest in multiple sclerosis. Several immune-modulating drugs are now available to effectively delay progression of neurodegeneration and work by influencing peripheral immune cell trafficking to the CNS or modulating immune cell activation. Natalizumab (anti-alpha-4 integrin) has been shown to block entry of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, alleviating disease progression and further highlighting the importance of studying interactions between the peripheral immune system and the CNS for therapeutic gain
22. The high level of specificity conferred by the autoantibody-mediated diseases of the nervous system offer a direct link between neuroscience and immunology, allowing their parallel study in humans with these diseases

"1510" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "In psychiatry, interleukin (IL)-6 has been identified as a potential target in patients with depression and schizophrenia using population cohort and genetic studies
24,
25. However, patients receiving IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab) as acute graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis experienced significantly more depressive symptoms
26. This indicates that further investigation is required to test the therapeutic potential of targeting the immune system specifically in patients with depression, such as the Insight study, a proof-of-concept experimental medicine trial of tocilizumab
27. Emerging evidence has also demonstrated that increased inflammation may identify the phenotypic profile of patients more likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory augmentation across depression and psychosis
28,
29. This highlights how, when testing an immune-modulatory drug in a complex disease like depression (or dementia), it is essential to first demonstrate that inflammation is occurring and stratify inflammatory patients to the therapy. Successful translation to the clinic will require evidence triangulation using different approaches. Inflammation is likely to be relevant for some, but not all patients with mental health disorders, and not at all stages of illness. Further work is needed to understand the characteristics of inflammation-related depression and psychosis in order to inform patient selection in future interventional studies, thereby improving trial readouts, which is critical for clinical translation." "f1000research"
"1511" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" "Furthermore, developing systems to experimentally suppress or stimulate the immune system under controlled conditions can provide a platform to study neuroimmune dysregulation or understand its function in the CNS. However, this will require standardisation of clinical parameters to aid comparative studies and interoperability of cohort data, for example standardisation of methods for measurement of neurological features (fatigue, pain, cognition) and protocols for collecting and processing samples for immune characterisation. Achieving this goal would be facilitated by closer collaboration between research teams." "f1000research"

Bringing together different research communities is therefore critical to making progress, ensuring a joined-up approach with sharing of knowledge and learning. With these proposed research priorities for the field, we hope to provide a focal point for teams, galvanise collective endeavours and move neuroimmunology forward as a whole. The importance of considering the impact of context when addressing these questions is also highlighted. With multiple groups tackling each problem from different, but complementary or even synergistic angles, together they will provide an ever more granular picture of how interactions between the immune and nervous systems influence health and disease. By defining the underpinning and causal mechanisms through basic science as well as translational research in human cohorts, we anticipate impacting on health and facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

Seventeen very well-respected scientists from the United Kingdom came together to address these and other issues. They lay the groundwork for a path forward to move biomedical research on communication systems between the central nervous and immune systems into the clinic. The authors do a good job of acknowledging and documenting the progress in basic research made in this field during the past few decades. Nevertheless, there is a real need to further support this rapidly expanding field by trying to understand reciprocal systems of communication that are now known to exist between the immune system and brain. The authors make a compelling recommendation to create teams from a variety of academic disciplines to accomplish this goal and to advance the field. I agree and support all of this." "f1000research"
"1517" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" " It is admirable for a group of esteemed scholars to come together, presumably virtually in October 2020 during the COVID19 pandemic. As a result, they agreed to include their names on a paper that boldly proposes ten approaches, all to be accomplished within 10 years, to achieve their goals. The authors propose ten questions within four different frameworks: (a) The context of understanding the importance of bidirectional communication (e.g., afferent vs efferent); (b) Deciphering whether neuroimmune crosstalk is more important in some contexts that others (e.g., development vs aging) and the contribution of co-morbidities; (c) The need for advancement and development of newer technologies to non-invasively assess neuroimmune interactions in animals and humans; and (d) The importance of translating answers to these ten fundamental questions into treatments that help patients. These are all reasonable and important issues for discussion in health and disease. If accomplished, the entire neuroimmunology field will be much stronger in 2031 than it is now 2021." "f1000research"
"1518" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" " This is a well-written and persuasive article, but it could be strengthened. Although top-down (efferent) pathways are mentioned, the clear focus of this article is on bottom-up communication from the immune system to the brain, with the aim of improving/understanding/treating mental health disorders. There is only one question that directly asks how neural circuits, presumably from both the central and peripheral nervous systems, affect immunity. Yet, the recent review by Aysa Rolls and colleagues makes a convincing argument for brain regulation of a variety of immune events (
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0387-1).
1 As such, the case for efferent regulation of the immune system by the brain could be stronger." "f1000research"
"1519" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" " Natural ways to exploit immune-brain communication to promote health, as opposed to treatment with drugs, could be discussed in more detail. For example, Western medicine finally has recognized that there are non-pharmaceutical approaches that can improve mental health disorders. They are mindfulness and exercise in all forms, with the practice of mindfulness now blending with traditional Chinese meditation and exercise. Other aspects of Eastern medicine also offer promise. For example, a major criticism of the use of acupuncture for the treatment of human diseases is the lack of an anatomical pathway to mediate the effects of specific acupoints. That critique will now change with the recent publication in
Nature that defined a neuroanatomical loop between the periphery and brain and the subsequent efferent signal that defines the manner by which a specific acupoint inhibits LPS-induced inflammation (

"1520" "10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1" " Finally, it is curious that the noun “physiology” is never mentioned throughout the entire paper. Yet systemic physiology is based not only on structure and function but also on communication systems among various organs in the body. Lungs communicate with the brain to regulate blood gas levels and the heart communicates with the lungs for the same reason. The kidney and lungs communicate with one another to maintain acid-base balance. These systems form regulatory feedback loops, which control everything from reproductive cycles to stress responses. It seems that, in principle, immune-brain communication would not be much different from these well-accepted autonomic reflexes. Yet this paper seems to present immune-brain communication as a one-way street, which is either afferent or efferent. As such, more emphasis could be given to regulatory feedback loops. For example, over thirty years ago Hugo Besedovsky discovered one of these feedback systems by showing that a peripheral inflammatory stimulus (IL-1) caused release of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus, ultimately leading to the release of corticosterone from the adrenal cortex (
Science 1987; 238:524-526). These data defined a clear immune afferent signal to the brain that caused an efferent endocrine response that in turn regulates some aspect of the immune system. One can always quibble about the ten questions that the authors propose to lead the field forward. But perhaps the authors might consider asking an eleventh question: What are the important physiological immune-brain feedback regulatory control loops and how are they affected throughout the life span and in health and disease?"

It's a very clear manuscript, highlighting the key research directions and main challenges in addressing them. The authors explain the rationale for selecting the directions they propose and discuss the main gaps in the field. It's a very timely piece and it summarizes the views of the authors. Thus, I can only offer a few suggestions, based on my experience as a reader, on how to increase its accessibility. 
In the section \"importance of context\" -adding references to articles that exemplify the proposed research directions, can help the readers better appreciate the potential of the field. For the technology part, an illustration of the challenges can be helpful. Adding more questions on how the nervous system affects immunity to Figure 1 will emphasize the bi-directional nature of the interactions.  For example, how do different forms of brain activity (different areas, states) affect immune activity? Which neuronal mediators can be secreted to the periphery?

"1551" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "The impact of cancer and cancer treatment on cognition and mood changes has been well-characterized [1]. While improved treatment has increased the number of cancer survivors, studies have demonstrated that cancer patients experience increased symptoms of cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and fatigue during and after cancer treatment [2]. These symptoms subvert normal functioning of the central and peripheral nervous system, which may manifest in pathophysiological process of health consequences [3]. As a result, more cancer patients and survivors now suffer from stress-related health outcomes, including fatal and non-fatal injuries, accident, and suicide [4–7]." "biomed_central"
"1552" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" ".It is plausible that biological mechanisms such as inflammation induced by cancer or cancer treatment contribute to increased risk of accidents and other unnatural deaths in cancer patients. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and increases in response to some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy [8]. Several studies have identified a relationship between circulating pro-inflammatory markers and symptoms of cognitive impairment, mood and stress-related disorders, as well as peripheral neuropathy both at cancer diagnosis and during or soon after cancer treatment [9, 10]. Markers of inflammation such as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were noted up to 20 years after cancer treatment and coincide with symptoms of cognitive decline [11]. In a recent study, we demonstrated that aspirin was able to block tumour-induced memory impairment in mouse models of breast cancer, suggesting its potential to combat cancer-related cognitive and mood symptoms [12]. In humans, aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID use was shown to be associated with decreased risk of depression and depressive symptoms [13], especially in terms of continued use of low-dose aspirin [14]."

"1554" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "Due to the availability of data on medication since July 2005, we identified all patients with a newly diagnosed cancer (N = 403,322) between October 2005 and December 2014 from the Swedish Cancer Register, which includes almost complete information on all cancers diagnosed in Sweden since 1958 onward [15]. All patients were cross-linked to the Swedish Causes of Death and Migration Registers using the personal identification numbers assigned uniquely to all residents in Sweden [16]. We excluded 155 patients who died and 14,724 patients who emigrated before cancer diagnosis, leaving 388,443 patients to be followed from the date of cancer diagnosis, until emigration (Migration Register), death (Causes of Death Register), or December 31, 2014, whichever occurred first. We used 7th Swedish revision of the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) codes to classify different cancer types (Supplementary Materials, Table S1)." "biomed_central"
"1555" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information on prescribed and dispensed medications from all Swedish pharmacies since July 2005 [17]. All pharmacies, retailers and wholesalers across the country are obligated to report the sales on monthly basis with overall very good data quality [17]. Unused drugs are advised to be returned to the pharmacies for incineration. The proportion of all returned drugs was around 2.3–4.6% of the dispensed volume [18]. Medications in this register are classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system [19]. The register includes information on medicine types, prescription and dispensing dates, quantity, defined daily dose and prescription text [17]. Low-dose aspirin and most NSAIDs cannot be purchased over-the-counter without a prescription in Sweden [20]. Patients who had medications dispensed with ATC codes B01AC06, B01AC30 and B01AC56 were considered as medicated with lose-dose aspirin (limited to daily dose of 75 or 160 mg). We focused on low-dose aspirin that tends to be used in long term in the present study, because of its potential effect of reducing stress-related outcomes [14, 21]. Patients who had medications dispensed with ATC code M01A were considered as medicated with non-aspirin NSAIDs." "biomed_central"
"1556" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "We identified all low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed from 3 months before cancer diagnosis until the end of follow-up, because prescription drugs are dispensed for up to a three-month supply in Sweden. Multiple prescriptions at the same dispense date for the same medicine (2% for aspirin, 1.6% for non-aspirin NSAIDs) were summed up and unused medicines returned to the pharmacies were extracted from the amount of the previous dispense (0.3% for aspirin, 0.3% for other NSAIDs). Because of the time-varying nature of medication use, we constructed on- and off-medication periods for each patient after cancer diagnosis through information on dispense date and dosage according to the prescription text. The on-medication period was defined as the interval from the most recent dispense date of a specific NSAID, until the last day when the dispensed drug was estimated to be consumed. Time periods outside the on-medication periods among patients that had ever used NSAIDs, and among patients that did not use any NSAID during follow-up, were defined as off-medication periods (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1)."

We used the 10th Swedish revision of ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes X60-X84, V01-X59, and Y85-Y86 to ascertain deaths from suicide and accident (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Death due to accident was further classified as deaths due to transport accident, fall, accidental threat to breathing, unspecified fracture, or others." "biomed_central"
"1559" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "Patients’ use of drug as well as their general health status may confound the association between aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of unnatural deaths from suicide and accident. To control for these confounding factors, we included socioeconomic status (education, occupation, cohabitation status), mental health status (history of psychiatric disorder), and general health status (Chronic Disease Score) as covariates. The Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA) was established by Statistics Sweden and collects data from labor market, and educational and social sectors annually for individuals over 16 years of age [24]. Information on the highest educational level, occupation, and cohabitation status at the time of diagnosis was retrieved from LISA for all cancer patients. Chronic Disease Score is a measure of comorbidity based on the aggregated number of prescribed medications. The score is a summary of weights from each comorbidity category represented by medication classes [25, 26]. As a proxy of general health status, we calculated a Chronic Disease Score, based on the prescribed medications before cancer diagnosis, for each patient [25], after excluding anxiolytics, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anti-inflammatory medications because of their close relationship with the exposure or other covariables. We defined history of psychiatric disorders as having any inpatient or outpatient hospital visit for psychiatric disorders from 1987 onward using the ICD-9 codes 290–319 and ICD-10 codes F10-F99. Because of the close link between psychiatric disorders and suicide and death due to accident [27, 28], we updated this variable per on- or off-medication period for each patient." "biomed_central"

In the first model, we used time since cancer diagnosis as the underlying timescale, and additionally adjusted the estimates for age at diagnosis (continuous variable), sex, highest educational level, occupation, cohabitation status, and calendar year of diagnosis. A continuous function of time was modeled with restricted cubic splines. In a second model, we additionally adjusted for cancer type, cancer stage, and Chronic Disease score (continuous variable). In a third model, in addition to all variables adjusted for the second model, we also adjusted for history of psychiatric disorders. The three models were designed to demonstrate the roles of different covariables on the studied associations. To illustrate the temporal pattern of the association, we also estimated the hazard as a function of time using restricted cubic splines with three knots that were evenly distributed along time at risk, based on the third model."

"1562" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "We performed sensitivity analyses. First, to assess the validity of our definition for on- and off-medication period, we defined the first month after each on-medication period also as on-medication period rather than off-medication period. Second, to separately evaluate the association for first-time use and repeated use of the medications, for each on- and off-medication period, we defined as with previous use if there was a previous on-mediation period since July 2005, and as without previous use if there was no previous on-medication period. Third, because a proportion of cancer patients had unknown stage at diagnosis, in a sensitivity analysis, we imputed unknown cancer stage to assess the influence of such missingness on the main results. Fourth, to exclude potential influence from other NSAIDs when investigating the effect of aspirin use (and vice versa), we compared the on-medication periods of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs with off-medication periods with neither aspirin nor non-aspirin NSAIDs. Finally, to assess the role of other medications with potential impact on cognitive function and psychiatric symptoms, we performed additional analysis with further adjustment for use of opioids (ATC code N02A), use of anxiolytics (ATC code N05B), or use of antidepressants (ATC code N06A)."

"1563" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "Because an association was mainly noted between the use of low-dose aspirin and accidental death, we also performed several secondary analyses to assess the robustness of this finding. First, because patients are often asked to discontinue aspirin use during surgical treatment to avoid major bleeding [29], we performed additional analysis to separately assess the studied associations within first year (as a proxy for the time window of primary cancer treatment including surgery) and beyond first year after cancer diagnosis. Second, to further alleviate the concern of residual confounding, we separately compared the on-medication periods with off-medication periods of the same individuals (within-individual comparison). Third, because individuals with different characteristics have been shown to have different risk of accidental death following a cancer diagnosis [30, 31], we separately analyzed the association by sex, age, cancer type, cancer stage, history of psychiatric disorders, Chronic Disease Score, highest educational level, cohabitation status, and employment status (employed vs. retired or unemployed). Finally, in addition to any death due to accident, we separately studied the association by major causes of accidental death." "biomed_central"

A higher incidence of death due to accident than suicide was consistently noted during the follow-up (Supplementary Materials Fig. S2).Table 1Baseline characteristics of cancer patients according to their use of low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before diagnosis onward, a cohort study of 388,443 cancer patients diagnosed between Oct 2005 and Dec 2014 in SwedenLow-dose aspirinNon-aspirin NSAIDsPatients without use of either medication(N = 192,333)Patients without use of low-dose aspirin(N = 273,123)Patients with use of low-dose aspirin (N = 115,320)Patients without use of non-aspirin NSAIDs(N = 275,449)Patients with use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (N = 112,994)Male, N (%)134,055 (49.1)70,209 (60.9)145,684 (52.9)58,580 (51.8)95,413 (49.6)Mean age at diagnosis (SD), year65.27 (13.0)73.70 (10.2)69.18 (12.8)64.35 (12.2)66.70 (13.0)Calendar year of diagnosis, N (%)2005–200880,797 (29.6)43,430 (37.6)71,183 (25.8)53,044 (46.9)45,283 (23.5)2009–201191,471 (33.5)40,789 (35.4)92,512 (33.6)39,748 (35.2)62,482 (32.5)2012–2014100,855 (36.9)31,101 (27.0)111,754 (40.6)20,202 (17.9)84,568 (44.0)Highest educational level, N (%)Beyond secondary school71,038 (26.0)19,899 (17.3)62,018 (22.5)28,919 (25.6)48,441 (25.2)Secondary school111,169 (40.7)41,880 (36.3)106,489 (38.7)46,560 (41.2)76,880 (40.0)Primary school88,207 (32.3)51,940 (45.0)103,726 (37.6)36,421 (32.2)64,993 (33.8)Missing2709 (1.0)1601 (1.4)3216 (1.2)1094 (1.0)2019 (1.0)Occupation, N (%)Blue collar23,767 (8.7)3498 (3.0)16,918 (6.1)10,347 (9.2)14,852 (7.7)White collar52,211 (19.1)7721 (6.7)37,922 (13.8)22,010 (19.5)33,300 (17.3)Farmers2079 (0.8)625 (0.5)1873 (0.7)831 (0.7)1452 (0.8)Self-employed9401 (3.4)2420 (2.1)7674 (2.8)4147 (3.7)6117 (3.2)Retired or unemployed143,688 (52.6)86,694 (75.2)166,437 (60.4)63,945 (56.6)103,998 (54.1)Unclassified or missing41,946 (15.4)14,355 (12.5)44,597 (16.2)11,704 (10.4)32,614 (16.9)Cohabitation status, N (%)Cohabitating136,088 (49.8)56,219 (48.8)129,433 (47.0)62,874 (55.6)91,427 (47.5)Non-cohabitating106,358 (38.9)46,411 (40.3)107,994 (39.2)44,775 (39.6)74,280 (38.6)Missing30,677 (11.2)12,690 (11.0)38,022 (13.8)5345 (4.7)26,626 (13.8)Cancer type, N (%)Prostate cancer49,566 (18.1)26,095 (22.6)49,439 (18.0)26,222 (23.2)32,590 (16.9)Breast cancer43,544(15.9)10,755 (9.3)36,298 (13.2)18,001 (15.9)28,985 (15.1)Colorectal cancer30,024 (11.0)13,221 (11.5)31,576 (11.5)11,669 (10.3)21,764 (11.3)Non-melanoma skin cancer14,972 (5.5)10,289 (8.9)20,044 (7.3)5217 (4.6)11.894 (6.2)Hematopoietic malignancy18,518 (6.8)9425 (8.2)21,340 (7.7)6603 (5.8)14.155 (7.4)Lung cancer18,017 (6.6)8693 (7.5)19,965 (7.2)6745 (6.0)13,210 (6.9)Severe cancer (esophagus, liver and pancreas)12,267 (4.5)4494 (3.9)13,829 (5.0)2932 (2.6)10,055 (5.2)Others86,215 (31.6)32,348 (28.1)82,917 (30.1)35,646 (31.5)59,680 (31.0)Cancer stage at diagnosisa, N (%)Localized limited79,238 (29.0)28,324 (24.5)75,534 (27.4)32,028 (28.3)55,302 (28.7)Localized advanced16,403 (6.0)7570 (6.6)16,778 (6.1)7195 (6.4)11,295 (5.9)Regional spread29,086 (10.7)10,704 (9.3)26,872 (9.8)12,918 (11.4)19,221 (10.0)Distant metastasis29,759 (10.9)10,668 (9.2)30,902 (11.2)9525 (8.4)22,431 (11.7)Unknown100,119 (36.7)48,629 (42.2)104,015 (37.8)44,733 (39.6)69,929 (36.4)Not applicable18,518 (6.8)9425 (8.2)21,348 (7.7)6595 (5.8)14,155 (7.3)History of psychiatric disorders, N (%)No239,491 (87.7)99,110 (85.9)239,975 (87.1)97,777 (86.5)167,971 (87.3)Yes33,632 (12.3)16,210 (14.1)35,474 (12.9)15,217 (13.5)24,362 (12.7)Chronic Disease Score, N (%)0105,699 (38.7)9004 (7.8)75,296 (27.3)39,407 (34.9)70,037 (36.4)1–2111,484 (40.8)28,884 (25.1)97,093 (35.3)43,275 (38.3)77,666 (40.4)3–549,854 (18.3)65,309 (56.6)88,137 (32.0)27,026 (23.9)39,307 (20.4)> 66086 (2.2)12,123 (10.5)14,923 (5.4)3286 (2.9)5323 (2.8)Abbreviations: NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsaDefined by European Network of Cancer Registries Condensed TNM Scheme and staging system: localized limited (T-localized/N0/M0 or FIGO 0-I), localized advanced (T-advanced/N0/M0 or FIGO II), regional spread (any T/N+/M0 or FIGO III), distant metastasis (any T/any N/M+ or FIGO IV), or unknown stage.

We found that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a 22% lower risk of death due to accident but not suicide whereas use of non-aspirin NSAIDs was not associated with the risk of either death due to accident or suicide. When separately analyzing prevalent use and incident use, we found that prevalent use of either aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was associated with a lower risk of death due to accident, whereas incident use of such medication was not. Our study provides evidence for a potentially beneficial effect of NSAID use, especially low-dose aspirin and long-term use, in reducing severe accidents after cancer diagnosis." "biomed_central"
"1586" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "The major strength of this study includes the nationwide population-based cohort design, the complete follow-up, and the prospectively and independently collected information on medication, cancer, and death outcomes, which largely minimized the potential risk of selection and information biases. The use of dispensed rather than prescribed medications, the use of prescription text to define medication status, and the time-varying definition of medication use served to limit potential misclassification of the exposure. Because medications are largely financed by the universal healthcare insurance to each resident in Sweden, the findings of the present study are not likely greatly influenced by other factors such as socioeconomic status." "biomed_central"
"1587" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "One limitation of the study is that the Prescribed Drug Register does not include medications administered during hospitalization or in nursing home. This may result in misclassification of the exposure to some extent. However, it is unlikely that such misclassification is differential in terms of the outcomes. Another limitation is that we did not have information on the actual consumption of medications among patients defined as exposed to these medications according to drug dispense. In our study, 84.0% patients ever medicated with low-dose aspirin had at least two dispensing records, indicating that vast majority of the users of low-dose aspirin had likely consumed the dispensed medications. Further, because patients who did not consume medications as expected should ideally have contributed their person time to the off-medication periods rather than on-medication periods, this misclassification is expected to have led to underestimation of the inverse association noted for aspirin use. Because information on other potential confounders such as lifestyle factors was unavailable, and there was a proportion of cancer patients with unknown cancer stage, residual confounding remains a concern. The similar results obtained in the within-individual comparison and after multiple imputation for unknown cancer stage alleviated this concern to some extent. There is also a concern of indication bias, namely that the indications for NSAIDs use - mostly inflammatory conditions - might have biased the estimates of the studied associations. This is likely most relevant for first-time use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs, for both of which an increased risk of death due to incidents was noted. As a result, the overall association as reported in Table 2 could also have been biased partially due to this. Finally, the possibility of chance findings cannot be excluded completely because of the smaller number of outcomes, and this is especially true for completed suicide." "biomed_central"
"1588" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "The excess risks of suicide and accidents among cancer patients have been reported in many countries [4, 6, 32, 33]. Although more than twice as many cancer patients die from accidents than from suicide [6, 31], risk of death due to accident and its underlying reasons has been less investigated. Psychological distress related to receiving a cancer diagnosis and treatment, together with its resultant psychiatric symptoms such as depression, fatigue and poor concentration, may trigger the occurrence of both suicide and accidents in cancer patients [7, 34]. To our knowledge, potential preventive strategies have not been developed to mitigate the elevated risk of these outcomes. In our study, we found that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of death due to accident. This finding, in line with previous studies, supports a potential role of aspirin use in reducing stress-related outcomes due to its anti-inflammatory properties [35, 36]. Indeed, both cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy have been associated with inflammation in cancer patients, which was further correlated with deficits in motor function [37, 38] and risk of external injuries [39, 40]. Aspirin may intervene in this process and modify the risk. Although not statistically significant, it seems the lowest estimate on risk reduction was observed among patients with severe cancers (cancer in esophagus, liver or pancreas). It is possible that this group of patients can potentially benefit more from the anti-inflammatory property of aspirin due to their high level of either tumor-induced or treatment-associated inflammation [41, 42]." "biomed_central"
"1589" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "The lack of statistically significant association between low-dose aspirin and risk of death due to suicide may indicate indeed a lack of association. However, it is also possible that an underlying association is masked by methodological issues. This contention is in particular compelling given recent findings showing that aspirin use reduces the risk of depression [21], which is a major predictor of suicide [7]. Unlike unpredictable death due to accident, completed suicide is intentional. During the immediate time period before suicide, patients might stop taking or dispensing medications [43]. This could have led to different kinds of biases. For instance, if the patients had dispensed aspirin recently, they would be counted as exposed to aspirin despite not actually using it. Alternatively, before suicide, patients might be less likely to dispense prescribed medications, leading to an artificial protective effect, i.e., less patients would have dispensed aspirin during the time before suicide compared to expected. Another possible explanation for the lack of a statistically significant association is the lack of statistical power because of the smaller number of completed suicide. Moreover, suicide is known to be a challenge in classifying causes of death, and can be misclassified as deaths due to accident [44]. When combining completed suicide and deaths due to accident as one outcome, we found a 21% lower risk of unnatural deaths associated with the use of low-dose aspirin. A protective effect of low-dose aspirin on the risk of suicide following a cancer diagnosis can therefore not be ruled out." "biomed_central"
"1590" "10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9" "Prevalent use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, but not incident use, was found to be associated with a lower risk of accidental death. Non-aspirin NSAIDs are a class of drugs with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic therapeutic properties [45]. Because of their side effect on gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems when used chronically [46, 47], non-aspirin NSAIDs are recommended for use at the lowest effective dose, and for short-term use when possible [48]. In our study, the average duration of exposure to non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.4 months, corresponding to 4% of exposed follow-up time) was substantially shorter compared with the average duration of exposure to low-dose aspirin (16 months, corresponding to 77% of exposed follow-up time). This is also reflected by the greater numbers of outcomes among on-medication periods with aspirin compared to the on-medication periods with non-aspirin NSAIDs (see Table 2 for instance). As a result, the null overall association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of death due to accident might be due to chance (or lack of statistical power). In a sensitivity analysis, we observed an inverse association between prevalent use of both aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs, but not incident use of either, and risk of death due to accident. These results suggest that long-term use of NSAIDs, whether aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs, is likely to be associated with a lower risk of death due to accident among cancer patients. The overall null association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of death due to accident might therefore be attributable to the fact that most of the non-aspirin NSAIDs are used in short term whereas short-term use of such medication is unlikely to be associated with a lower risk of death due to accident among cancer patients. Taken together, these results might indicate the potential role of the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs in modulating the risk of accidents among patients with cancer." "biomed_central"

"1595" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "The experience of fatigue is ubiquitous in both health and disease. Although the concept of fatigue is firmly embedded within modern life, typical lay understanding of what is meant when describing oneself as fatigued can be diverse and multifaceted. Dictionary definitions of fatigue (n.) include 1) “extreme tiredness resulting from mental or physical exertion or illness”; 2) “a reduction in the efficiency of a muscle or organ after prolonged activity”; and 3) “a lessening in one’s response to or enthusiasm for something, caused by overexposure” (Stevenson, 2010). Thus, fatigue is often used to describe a broad combination of physical, sensory, and cognitive epiphenomena. As such, colloquial understanding of fatigue may serve to complicate its formal study, exacerbate its multidimensionality (Karshikoff et al., 2017), and emphasise the need to clearly distinguish it from other related phenomena (e.g., sleepiness) which share common descriptors (e.g., “tiredness”; Shen et al., 2006)." "springer_us"
"1596" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Currently, there is no universally accepted definition or agreed standard measure for the assessment of fatigue (Dittner et al., 2004; Kluger et al., 2013). Consequently, the study of fatigue has forged increasingly reductionistic approaches across divergent fields, fragmenting fatigue research (Pattyn et al., 2018). One common distinction is the separation of pathological fatigue from the “normal,” physiological fatigue that we all experience in everyday life. The latter is a transient, nonpathological symptom with an identifiable cause (e.g., physical or cognitive exertion), which wanes with the removal of the stressor (i.e., through rest). On the other hand, pathological fatigue is the prolonged (1-5 months) or chronic (>6 months) experience of symptoms (Jason et al., 2010), which are unalleviated by rest and may present as a primary symptom, a secondary symptom or a comorbidity within neurological diseases (Penner & Paul, 2017). Qualitative reports from patients indicate differences in both the severity and quality of fatigue experienced in disease (Flinn & Stube, 2010; Repping-Wuts et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2011) supporting this distinction. However, due to the absence of a universal and standardised measure of fatigue, quantification of these differences across health and disease may be limited by the type of fatigue assessed (e.g., trait vs. state) and the heterogeneity (e.g., uni- vs. multidimensional) of symptoms considered (Dittner et al., 2004). Indeed, the separate instruments used to assess chronic/trait versus acute symptoms of fatigue may in itself aid in perpetuating distinctions and introduce confounding affective influences (e.g., depression) on the interpretation of (trait/chronic) fatigue symptoms (c.f. Tseng et al., 2010). It remains unclear whether pathological and nonpathological fatigue can be considered fully distinct phenomena. Interestingly, a common feature of pathological fatigue is an exacerbation of symptoms following some form of acute exertion (Nijs et al., 2010). It is therefore conceivable that exertional fatigue is a fundamental component encompassed within the pathological experience of fatigue, supporting a common mechanism within both disease and health that ultimately functions to regulate energy expenditure and work output (Chaudhuri & Behan, 2004)." "springer_us"
"1597" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Within the clinical neurosciences, several theories of pathological fatigue and its underpinning neurocomputations have recently been proposed, each aligned to contemporary understanding of brain function (Kuppuswamy, 2017; Stephan et al., 2016). Building upon early propositions that perception represents unconscious, knowledge-driven inference (Helmholtz, 1860), these contemporary accounts build upon the notion that our ability to perceive, act, attend, and learn may all be accounted for by viewing the brain as a self-evidencing inference machine (Dayan et al., 1995; Friston, 2005). Predictive processing, in which explanations of sensory states are not simply extracted from sensory input streams, but instead constructed through establishing causal structures that incorporate prior expectations of sensory inputs, is posited to be a core principle of brain function (Bubic et al., 2010; Clark, 2013; Friston, 2009; Hohwy, 2014). The consideration of how precisely the brain constructs perception at the forefront of emerging accounts of pathological fatigue contrasts with many current perspectives on the transient symptoms of fatigue in response to acute, protracted exertion in health. Although previous predictive processing accounts offer a common foundation to describe and formally distinguish pathological from nonpathological, exertional fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016), an explicit account of the dynamics of the inferential processes underpinning the development of the latter is yet to be clearly described. Our goal therefore is to extend the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al., 2016) and offer a more explicit account of the changing inferential processes that give rise to the conscious experience of fatigue during acute, transient exertion. We focus on how this framework may be applied to the study of transient fatigue symptoms arising from homeostatic perturbations incurred through sustained physical exercise.1" "springer_us"
"1598" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Despite the absence of a standardised definition of fatigue, recent taxonomical frameworks for the study of the various causes and consequences of fatigue have been proposed (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016; Kluger et al., 2013). These taxonomies has been applied to facilitate articulation of fatigue in both neurological conditions (Kluger et al., 2013) and in response to acute, physical exertion (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016). Within it, fatigue is described as a self-reported, disabling symptom incorporating two dimensions: a subjective dimension (“perceived fatigue”), associated with broad feelings linked to weariness and exhaustion, and/or an objective dimension (“performance fatigability”), denoting a reduction in some marker of (physical and/or cognitive) performance (Kluger et al., 2013). Although these aspects of fatigue may interact, they are ultimately considered distinct and may emerge independently (Kluger et al., 2013). In the context of physical exertion, recently proposed frameworks have expanded the subjective dimension such that it includes any change in perception that aids in regulating the performer and is referred to as “perceived fatigability” (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016). Examples experienced during a task may include the perceived level of effort required (Staiano et al., 2018)and/or changes in affective valence (Hartman et al., 2019). Although combining multiple axes under one broad rubric has appeal for describing the complex and constantly changing processes involved in the control of physical performance, the concept of “perceived fatigability” may risk confusing an already complicated and multifactorial phenomenon, such as fatigue, and may detract from its functional role in the context of physical exertion. That is, the subjective component of fatigue is often conflated and used interchangeably with concepts, such as perception of effort. Although related, these represent distinct constructs (Halperin & Emanuel, 2020; Micklewright et al., 2017) with separate functional consequences (Greenhouse-Tucknott et al., 2020)." "springer_us"
"1599" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Fundamentally, fatigue represents a subjective symptom (Penner & Paul, 2017). Indeed, emphasis on changes in objective, performance-based markers of fatigue (i.e., fatigability), particularly within health, may capture only a small part of the total fatigue process since performance may be maintained through goal-orientated control processes at the expense of the perception of fatigue (Hockey, 2011; Hockey, 2013). It also is important to recognise that acute performance decrements may emerge following protracted exertion in response to other transient, affective states, such as boredom. Boredom and fatigue may be differentiated based on the level of arousal engendered by a task, corresponding to a state of under- or over-arousal, respectively (Pattyn et al., 2008). Thus, in healthy populations two conditions appear necessary for the acute, transient emergence of fatigue: 1) high task demands or arousal in which, 2) the ability to exert effective control is challenged (Hockey, 2011). In this perspective, we describe a neurocomputational account of the subjective perception of fatigue (hereafter simply referred to as fatigue) that emerges in response to changing perceptions of control efficacy during demanding physical exertion, based on a predictive processing framework."

"1600" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Under conceptualisations of predictive processing, the brain is formalised as a statistical organ that continuously seeks to render the external environment predictable. This is achieved through forming and testing predictions of generative models (i.e., models that explain how sensory inputs are generated probabilistically by latent states of the world) against incoming sensory evidence (Clark, 2013). By inverting generative models (i.e., computing the probability of the states of the world, given the sensory inputs), perception is described as a form of statistical inference achieved through minimizing the discrepancy (prediction error) between predictions (or perceptual hypotheses) and current sensory evidence (Stephan et al., 2016). Unlike traditional views of perception as a stimulus-response process, perception is instead highly ingrained and contextualised by our beliefs2 about the statistical nature of the world (Clark, 2015). In keeping with the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Knill & Pouget, 2004), models are cast as following an approximate form of Bayesian inference. This inferential process is implemented through predictive coding (Friston, 2005; Rao & Ballard, 1999). Together, multilevel cortical systems are proposed to transfer prediction and prediction error across a series of recurrent ‘loops,’ in which probabilistic predictions (or priors/beliefs) are passed top-down from higher to lower levels, while prediction errors (i.e., the unexplained data) travel laterally (within the same level) and ascend through forward projections to the level above and serve to update predictions (Fig. 1). This is equivalent to a belief update or the transformation of prior into posterior probabilities. In these models, the goal is to update beliefs at all levels of the hierarchy such that the discrepancy between predicted states and sensory inputs is minimal. Optimization of posterior probability therefore operates through the minimization of prediction error and enables perceptual inference, which across the multiple levels of the hierarchy can provide deep explanation of sensory data (Friston, 2009; Hohwy, 2014).
Fig. 1Neuronal architecture underpinning hierarchical predictive processing. The main figure on the right depicts a simple hierarchy that is assumed to incorporate a predictive coding encoding strategy. The system is split into five separate levels in which descending predictions (blue arrows) are transferred within the same level and to the level below. Our prior predictions are not always accurate—thus generating a prediction error. These computed prediction errors are represented by red arrows and are transferred within and between layers, ascending to the level above. The system is self-organising enabling the minimization of prediction error through updates to beliefs (i.e., posterior probability), which subsequently form new predictions passed on to the level below (i.e., empirical priors). This facilitates deep explanations of sensory inputs. Precision (i.e., inverse variance), akin to a measure of the signal-to-noise properties of an input, informs of the uncertainty or “confidence” placed in the sensory evidence. Precision determines the influence of prior beliefs relative to sensory inputs on prior updates. For example, the two depictions on the left of the figure illustrate how posterior distributions (black curves) of the value of a hidden state may be influenced by the relative precision of the prior (blue curves) and prediction error distributions (red curves). The width of the distributions indicates their variance, with precision the inverse of this variance. Precise prediction errors increase the influence of sensory evidence on updates to model predictions (i.e., posterior) (a). Conversely, when prediction errors are imprecise, they have little impact on the posterior belief (b). Precision must be estimated (second-order predictions; system not shown explicitly here) and is established by predictions descending from the highest level of the hierarchy (blue dashed line). The relative precision of prediction errors at every level of the system is believed to be controlled by neuromodulatory actions that gate or control the gain of error carrying neuronal units (grey arrows).

"1602" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Prediction error may be minimized in two ways: 1) predictions may be updated to better explain sensory inputs (i.e., perceptual inference; described above); 2) sensory evidence that conforms to prior expectations may be selectively sampled through action. For example, within the motor system, motor commands are recast as a set of proprioceptive predictions concerning the sensory consequences of action, which are enacted through classical closed-loop reflexes enacted at lower levels of the hierarchy (Adams et al., 2013). Under the framework of active inference, perception and action are integrated functions of a coordinated process designed to minimize the experience of prediction error (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2016). Critically, understanding how perception and action emerge within predictive frameworks also requires a measure of the expected variability in the sensory data. Therefore, inferential computations must predict the sensory inputs (first-order predictions) and the reliability of this signal (second-order predictions) to make informed judgments on which to base perception and engage action (Kanai et al., 2015). The relative precision (i.e., inverse uncertainty; reflecting signal-to-noise, or more informally, confidence in the sensory signal) of prediction and prediction error determines their respective influence on posterior beliefs (Fig. 1a and b; see Friston, 2009). Predictions of high relative precision will dominate inferential processes (e.g., action), even in the presence of conflicting sensory evidence. Conversely, predictions of low precision afford greater weighting to sensory inputs which may force us to reevaluate and update model predictions (Friston, 2009, 2010). Attention has been proposed as a process of precision inference, through which estimates of precision may be optimized (Feldman & Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2012). Therefore attention, alongside action and perception, represents a natural component of error minimization within predictive processing. The estimation of expected precision within uncertain environments corresponds to higher-order beliefs concerning the reliability of sensory evidence (Fig. 1; Clark et al., 2018). Beliefs about beliefs (i.e., beliefs about estimated precision; hyperpriors) may provide a formalised description of metacognition (Friston et al., 2013). Within predictive processing, metacognition has been described as a high-level form of inference associated with the overall performance of prediction error minimization (Petzschner et al., 2017; Stephan et al., 2016)" "springer_us"
"1603" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "As well as inferring the ambiguous states of our external environment, our brains also must infer the cause of hidden states of the body (Seth & Critchley, 2013). Several accounts have applied predictive processing within the domain of interoception to explain how dynamically changing visceral, metabolic, autonomic, immunological, and hormonal conditions are integrated (Ainley et al., 2016; Barrett, 2017; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Gu et al., 2013; Seth et al., 2012; Seth & Critchley, 2013; Seth & Friston, 2016). All biological agents strive to maintain internal states within set bounds (homeostasis) and minimize the entropy of experienced sensory states (Friston, 2010). Interoceptive inference provides a potential explanation of how our brains respond to anticipated future needs of the body (allostasis; Sterling, 2012), and how those needs may be maintained across varying temporal scales; from (short-term) autonomic reflexes to (long-term) gross behavioural responses (Pezzulo et al., 2015). Allostasis and the representation of interoceptive consequences of action is a fundamental principle of all basic psychological functions (Kleckner et al., 2017), including our emotional experiences (Barrett, 2017; Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013) and the conscious appreciation and recognition of self (Apps & Tsakiris, 2014; Seth et al., 2012; Seth & Friston, 2016). For a more in-depth discussion on the formulations of homeostatic and allostatic function within current predictive processing frameworks, see Corcoran and Hohwy (2019)." "springer_us"
"1604" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Increasingly, the (patho)aetiology of subjective feelings of fatigue have been attributed to altered computational inference, affecting the ability of hierarchical systems to reconcile sensorimotor/interoceptive predictions and sensory data (Clark et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2012; Kuppuswamy, 2017; Manjaly et al., 2019; Stephan et al., 2016; Wrightson et al., 2019). This may occur at several loci within the hierarchy (Petzschner et al., 2017; Stephan et al., 2016). For example, dysfunctional sensory receptors (Light et al., 2009) may increase prediction error even in the absence of overt perturbations, while unduly precise prior beliefs may generate flawed perceptual inferences that are impervious to prediction error updates (van der Schaaf et al., 2018). In respect of the latter, abnormal prior beliefs endowed with high precision through the misallocation of attentional resources have been proposed as the theoretical basis of many medically unexplained or “psychogenic” symptoms (Edwards et al., 2012). In this context, pathological symptoms of fatigue may potentially emerge as an indirect consequence of abnormal attentional processes (Edwards et al., 2012). However, it remains unclear exactly how the experience of fatigue would emerge exactly. Alternative accounts have described fatigue as a direct outcome of metacognitive processing (Stephan et al., 2016). Here, continued experience of (interoceptive) prediction error, despite engaging in corrective action, is monitored within a metacognitive layer and forges the belief that allostatic control processes are incapable of effectively minimizing interceptive prediction error (that is, one experiences low “allostatic control self-efficacy”), which is experienced subjectively as fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016)." "springer_us"
"1605" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Stephan et al.'s (2016) compelling model provides a computational account of pathological fatigue, which the authors contend may be formally distinguished from the acute, transient exertional fatigue experienced in health (referred to by the authors as “tiredness”3). In this model, changes at a somatic level and/or within the hierarchical system’s circuitry in response to disease disrupts computational functions (which may involve various levels of the hierarchy) such that dyshomeostasis (error within the interoceptive model) is persistently experienced, engendering a perceived lack of control over bodily states which in turn fosters the conscious perception of fatigue. Importantly, in pathological fatigue, these disruptions affect the system in such a way that the detection of dyshomeostasis is not abated even through rest. Therefore, mastery over body states is not easily restored and the perception of fatigue endures. This is the fundamental difference between chronic, pathological experiences of fatigue and the acute feeling states incurred through physical activity. In the latter, prediction errors arising from metabolic responses to exercise can be effectively attenuated by action (i.e., rest), allowing the gradient of interoceptive “surprise” to turn negative and thus agency to be experienced through the restoration of homeostasis during a period of recovery." "springer_us"
"1606" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "However, Stephan and colleague’s description of acute symptoms of fatigue does not explore the dynamics of the inference-control loop during the homeostatic challenges imposed by prolonged physical exertion (Gabriel & Zierath, 2017; Jeukendrup et al., 2000; Joyner & Coyle, 2008). Thus, an explicit account of how the acute, transient symptoms of fatigue emerge in relation to protracted physical exertion remains absent. Here, we conform to the proposition forwarded by Stephan et al. (2016)—that fatigue arises from the metacognitive detection of persistent prediction error which reduces perceived capability of exerting effective control over the body (reduced self-efficacy)—and extend the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis to describe the changing metacognitive beliefs and inferential computations that may underlie the development of exertional fatigue." "springer_us"
"1607" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "According to Stephan et al. (2016), pathological fatigue may initially reflect an adaptive process, promoting rest and the conservation of energetic resources when effective actions to restore homeostasis are not perceived to be present. We extend this, contending that the experience of fatigue serves a similar function during acute physical exertion, in line with previous assertions (St Clair Gibson & Noakes, 2004). The selection of (goal-directed) actions may be devolved to an inferential issue, whereby actions and their predicted outcomes are chosen for the agent to ultimately frequent predictable states long-term(Friston, 2009; Friston et al., 2014). Importantly, this may involve predicting the consequences of actions across different temporal scales and contexts (Pezzulo et al., 2018). In some instances, the active experience of uncertain states may be tolerated if it helps guide future behaviour towards the minimization of prediction error (e.g., exploitation versus exploration; Schwartenbeck et al., 2013). However, for goal-directed actions to be maintained, the precision of the driving high-level beliefs must be high in order to dominate posterior beliefs, maintain attention and enable action (Pezzulo et al., 2015). However, all physical behaviour involves energetic expenditure, providing an ever-changing homeostatic context which must also be predicted within the transition towards the said outcome. The integration of salient, motivational information (e.g., bodily states) informs inferential processes that influence the selection of control policies in the pursuit of goal states (Pezzulo et al., 2018). Accordingly, for action to continue in any given form, interoceptive prediction error (and effects on control circuits) must be suppressed. However, the act of doing so, through attentional processes4 or lower-level perceptual updates, indicates that initial predictions did not provide a good fit to the sensory data." "springer_us"
"1608" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "The continued need to suppress prediction error in the pursuit of goals is the important extension of the proposal outlined by Stephan et al. (2016), forming the basis of metacognitive inference dynamics leading to the experience of fatigue emerging from acute (physical) exertion. We propose that the suppression of prediction error at all lower-﻿levels during the maintenance of goal-directed action driven by higher levels, is subject to the same metacognitive appraisal as described in the conceptualisation of pathological fatigue. Persistent experience of error within hierarchical models undermines (short-term) control mastery, reducing self-efficacy and is experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Metacognition within predictive processing may be ascribed computationally to beliefs about the precision of priors (Friston et al., 2013). The metacognitive experience of fatigue may therefore be associated with an increasing uncertainty in expected sensory states, reflecting low precision beliefs cascading down from high to low levels of the hierarchy. Low precision at higher, temporally-distal, and more abstract levels of prediction may be unable to contextualise prediction error effectively. Eventually over time, this decline in precision beliefs may be such that there is a shift in the dominant control of behaviour towards lower levels, which attempt to reconcile more immediate differences between predictions and prediction errors (Pezzulo et al., 2015; Fig. 2).
Fig. 2Predictive processing framework underlying the emergence of exertional fatigue. The engagement of protracted physical exertion requires internal models to accurately anticipate the sensory states that will be encountered to have the body reside within a (predictable) limited range of states that will sustain it biological integrity (i.e. maintain homeostasis). The subjective perception of fatigue may serve an adaptive function representing the ability of internal models to predict transition states during the pursuit of temporally distal goal states. (1) Under resting conditions or even low-intensity(physical) exertion, evidence of sensory states (green arrow) may be predictable (i.e., black posterior distribution dominated by blue prior beliefs). This may see the minimization of prediction error predominated by (autonomic) reflexes at the lowest level of the hierarchy. (2) However, as demands increase, and internal conditions becomes more unstable, physiological perturbations may be associated with greater prediction errors. Increasing strength of the prediction error (i.e., red distribution curve) may force error to ascend further up the levels of the hierarchy, necessitating deeper explanation, increasing its influence on posterior probabilities. This may generate attentional changes or perceptual updates across these lower levels. Yet importantly, as goal-directed action (i.e., physical exercise) is driven by higher-level beliefs, it may continue if the precision of these distal goal beliefs enables it to dominate prior updates and therefore contextualise the levels beneath (i.e., posterior distribution still dominated by prior beliefs). Estimation of the precision of beliefs is inferred in a separate stream (here simply represented by the grey circle). (3) Across time, the performance of the model’s overall prediction of the transition of states within goal pursuit is monitored by a metacognitive layer. Persistent detection of error within the hierarchy signals an inability to exert effective (allostatic) control of internal states during the pursuit of (longer term) goal states. This signals that the model may provide bad predictions about the present and, importantly, future condition(s) of the body. This perceived lack of control over bodily states undermines allostatic control self-efficacy, which is experienced as the subjective feeling of exertional fatigue. Computationally, the emergence of fatigue may be associated with declining precision estimates afforded to predictions driving goal-directed behaviour, signalling increasing uncertainty within the model and weakening the influence of priors on posterior beliefs (dashed blue line). The development of exertional fatigue is progressive, thus lower precision beliefs concerning goal-directed predictions result in greater prediction error throughout the levels of the hierarchy, which further undermine control capabilities during goal pursuit. Eventually, changing precision beliefs will see prediction error cause high-level, goal-directed beliefs to be updated (i.e., shift in posterior distribution towards prediction error) which may shift control priorities toward the resolution of more immediate prediction error. This may be achieved through action (i.e., rest). Over time, rest restores self-efficacy in ones' ability exert control over bodily states through the experience of agency (i.e., accurate predictions) in the restoration of homeostasis. Fatigue is therefore alleviated. However importantly, due to the significant challenge to model evidence encountered, restoration of perceived mastery of the body and homeostasis may be protracted. This is because precision estimates of predictions may be so low that prediction error is exacerbated during the recovery period. Therefore, the detection of accurate allostatic predictions may be strewn with prediction error which prolongs the subjective experience of fatigue.

This perceived lack of control over bodily states undermines allostatic control self-efficacy, which is experienced as the subjective feeling of exertional fatigue. Computationally, the emergence of fatigue may be associated with declining precision estimates afforded to predictions driving goal-directed behaviour, signalling increasing uncertainty within the model and weakening the influence of priors on posterior beliefs (dashed blue line). The development of exertional fatigue is progressive, thus lower precision beliefs concerning goal-directed predictions result in greater prediction error throughout the levels of the hierarchy, which further undermine control capabilities during goal pursuit. Eventually, changing precision beliefs will see prediction error cause high-level, goal-directed beliefs to be updated (i.e., shift in posterior distribution towards prediction error) which may shift control priorities toward the resolution of more immediate prediction error. This may be achieved through action (i.e., rest). Over time, rest restores self-efficacy in ones' ability exert control over bodily states through the experience of agency (i.e., accurate predictions) in the restoration of homeostasis. Fatigue is therefore alleviated. However importantly, due to the significant challenge to model evidence encountered, restoration of perceived mastery of the body and homeostasis may be protracted. This is because precision estimates of predictions may be so low that prediction error is exacerbated during the recovery period. Therefore, the detection of accurate allostatic predictions may be strewn with prediction error which prolongs the subjective experience of fatigue.

"1610" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "To illustrate this hypothesis, we provide an example based on the experience of fatigue during sustained physical exercise. Once the decision to engage with exercise has been made, the brain must predict not only the proprioceptive consequences of action, interactions with the social and physical environment, but also the homeostatic consequences of the transition towards the intended goal state, in order to maintain biological integrity. This is obviously challenging, since protracted whole-body exercise incurs a vast array of ever-changing processes across a range of biological systems (Hawley et al., 2014); the strength of which may exceed the control capable by simple reflexes at the lowest level and therefore competes for attention and higher-level control (Fig. 2). To continue towards goals (e.g. persist with the current exercise task), precise, high-level beliefs must be maintained. Action (i.e. reducing intensity) offers a means to minimize interoceptive prediction errors during goal pursuit but in certain instances this may directly challenge the probability of the expected or intended goal state being reached." "springer_us"
"1611" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Alternately, changes in attention and perceptual updates arising from prediction error minimization at lower levels may serve to enable goal-directed action to continue in a given form (e.g., speed). This may however, come at the expense of incurring further prediction error further on within a new inferential cycle. Regular and continued detection of error and the need for ensuing updates to maintain action increases evidence against initial model predictions and the capacity to effectively control the body’s states during exercise. As such, self-efficacy in ones' capacity to experience future goal states whilst controlling homeostatic integrity in this transition is undermined and experienced consciously as fatigue. Reduced confidence propagates, top-down, through the hierarchy, thus higher goal beliefs increasingly lose their ability to predict future outcomes and contextualise lower-level prediction errors. At this point, a shift to lower-level controllers may attempt to restore self-efficacy by minimizing the experience of prediction error on more immediate timescales (Pezzulo et al., 2015). That is, we are forced to slow down or stop altogether." "springer_us"
"1612" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Minimization of interoceptive prediction errors may not be immediate (e.g., replenishment of resting muscle glycogen stores can take many hours following exercise; Casey et al., 1995), therefore proprioceptive predictions5 may potentially be used as proxies for predicting the states which will eventually see interoceptive prediction error minimized (Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017; Pezzulo et al., 2018). By slowing down or stopping all together, the minimization of proprioceptive (and prospective interoceptive) prediction errors signals conditions that will see the restoration of homeostasis, indicating a level of control over bodily states which serves to alleviate fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016). However, the restoration of control self-efficacy is not immediate. Indeed, allostatic predictions used to maintain homeostatic set-points likely function across different biological systems under their own individual time constants (Stephan et al., 2016), which may see the experience of dyshomeostasis prolonged during rest. In addition, incurred deficits in allostatic self-efficacy and the subsequent decline in the precision afforded to control predictions (the proposed hallmark of fatigue) may underscore the protracted experience of fatigue post-exertion even when homeostatic balance has been restored. That is, increased sensitivity to prediction error during recovery (i.e., rest) may be maintained due to the loss of precision afforded to control predictions. It is possible that full alleviation of the conscious experience of fatigue may require the detection of a similar series of events to that through which it developed (i.e., protracted experience of accurate predictions related to interoceptive states). If this is the case, the experience of fatigue may urge us to stop in order to restore confidence in allostatic control beliefs and rest may represent the most effective context in which this may occur." "springer_us"
"1613" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "The neuroanatomical circuits supporting interoception and homeostasis have been extensively described (Craig, 2002, 2003; Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Damasio & Carvalho, 2013) and incorporated within models of interoceptive inference and allostatic control (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Gu et al., 2013; Stephan et al., 2016). Stephan et al. (2016) propose an additional metacognitive layer within established interoceptive pathways which monitors interoceptive prediction performance and is responsible for the emergence of fatigue. Putative structures include visceromotor regions, such as the anterior insula cortex (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)(Craig, 2002)and/or portions of the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)(Fleming & Dolan, 2012). In support of the former, the experience of fatigue has been shown to correlate with increased activity within visceromotor regions following an acute interoceptive (e.g., inflammation) challenge (Harrison et al., 2009, 2015). The dense connectivity of the AIC and ACC has seen them identified as part of the brain’s “rich-club,” enabling communication across diverse networks (e.g., default and salience) and facilitating the representation of the body and allostatic control as integral component of psychobehavioural functions (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Kleckner et al., 2017)." "springer_us"
"1614" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Strikingly, studies of acute physical and cognitive exertion have identified a similar network involving the AIC, ACC, and portions of the dorsal lateral PFC (dlPFC), activated with demanding activity across both domains (see Müller & Apps, 2019 for summary). This network was implicated in the development of fatigue, assigned specifically with the monitoring of neural-responses within task-specific regions and the computation of the cost/benefits of continued action (Müller & Apps, 2019). Insula activity has also been shown to parallel increasing physiological demands in response to greater exercise intensities and durations (Williamson et al., 1999), with pronounced mid/AIC activation associated with the point of task failure (Hilty, Jäncke, et al., 2011a). Enhanced synchronisation of insula and primary motor cortex (M1) activity also has been observed toward the end of volitional exercise (Hilty, Langer, et al., 2011b), which may reflect the influence of the dynamically changing conditions of the body on selected control (action) policies. Indeed, one plausible hypothesis, similar to that proposed recently by McMorris et al. (2018), is that AIC is responsible for generating an awareness of the performance of interoceptive predictions and allostatic control during exercise, and therefore fatigue. The representation of allostatic control performance may be continuously influenced by inputs from the dlPFC, which may signal the level of uncertainty within (longer-term) predictions. The ACC is believed to play an important role in deciding between actions during physical exertion (Lutz, 2018) and thus may be involved in encoding the estimated precision of competing predictions and prediction errors based on inputs received regarding the performance of interoceptive predictions (see also Craig, 2009). Precision dynamics arbitrate between the dominant controllers within the hierarchy in pursuit of the suppression of (long-term) prediction error (Pezzulo et al., 2015), with the encoding of precision assigned to neuromodulatory systems (e.g., dopamine; Friston et al., 2012). It has been proposed that the development of exertional fatigue may coincide with changes in the firing of neuromodulatory neurons within the (lateral) PFC, modulating motivation and choice based on the integration of interoceptive and reward pathways (McMorris et al., 2018). The current proposal holds that changes in neuromodulatory control across various regions of the brain reflects the optimisation of precision across the hierarchy to minimize prediction error, and fatigue is associated with a progressive reduction in precision estimates of high-level predictions driving action."

"1615" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "The core proposition of the proposed model contends that detection of repeated prediction error within interoceptive circuits during acute bouts of physical exertion undermines control efficacy beliefs, reductions in which provide the foundation of the perception of fatigue. Several lines of evidence in the existing literature support these central assertions and provide the basis of future investigations." "springer_us"
"1616" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "Multiple studies have investigated the association between self-efficacy, emotion (Focht et al., 2007; Magnan et al., 2013; McAuley et al., 1999), and behavioural responses to acute physical exertion (Halper & Vancouver, 2016; Hutchinson et al., 2008; McAuley & Courneya, 1992; Weinberg et al., 1981). Perceived capacity to successfully engage in further physical exertion has been demonstrated to both increase (Blacklock et al., 2010; Katula et al., 1999) and decrease (Focht et al., 2007; Katula et al., 1999; Welch et al., 2010) in response to acute bouts of exercise. The direction of this effect appears to be associated with the intensity of the bout (Blacklock et al., 2010; Katula et al., 1999). Deterioration in performance self-efficacy has been demonstrated at intensities at which a change in the metabolic environment is evident (Welch et al., 2010) and importantly, this decrement has been associated with the phenomenological experience of fatigue (Focht et al., 2007). These findings provide support for the proposition that physiological perturbations evoked by demanding physical exertion impact perceived efficacy which may be the origin for the acute, transient experience of exertional fatigue. However, future research is required to empirically establish whether unstable metabolic responses during exercise lead directly to a deterioration in self-efficacy and to confirm the temporal association between changes in perceived efficacy and the phenomenological experience of fatigue during physical exertion. Weakening of self-efficacy is proposed to evolve from continued metacognitive detection of prediction error (Stephan et al., 2016). Presently, few studies have directly examined the effect of physical exertion on metacognitive function (Palmer et al., 2019), despite recognition that it is a process fundamental to self-regulation during prolonged physical exertion (Brick et al., 2015; Brick et al., 2020; see Brick et al., 2016). Future examination of the metacognitive basis of exertional fatigue under the present proposal could see the use of a combination of metacognitive assessments alongside the modelling of precision estimates from behavioural responses (Hezemans et al., 2020; Wolpe et al., 2014). Interestingly, using this behavioural modelling approach, apathy—a construct often correlated with fatigue—has recently been associated with a low precision-weighting of performance predictions (Hezemans et al., 2020)." "springer_us"
"1617" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "It is unclear whether potential reductions in self-efficacy relate to confidence in one’s ability to control or accurately perceive viscerosensory information. Experimental manipulation of prediction error within interoceptive paradigms provides a suitable challenge. The exercise science literature is replete with experimental interventions designed to manipulate physical or perceived states during exercise, with a predominant focus on altering interoceptive-associated feedback (Amann et al., 2009; Castle et al., 2012; Hartman et al., 2019; Iodice et al., 2019). However, it is important to note for future investigations that under the current framework, perception is understood only when descending beliefs and ascending sensory evidence are considered in conjunction. To highlight this point, recent evidence demonstrated that perception of a weak, exteroceptive stimulus was influenced by its relative timing within the cardiac cycle with effects of presumed heartbeat-event predictions observed throughout the somatosensory cortex (Al et al., 2020). It is expected that interoceptive self-efficacy will be most impaired when the divergence between expectations and physiological states is at its greatest." "springer_us"
"1618" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "In healthy populations, sustained contractions are perceived as more effortful when performed in a perceived state of fatigue, even in condition absent of any functional changes to the active muscles (Greenhouse-Tucknott et al., 2020). Similarly, effort perception during motor tasks has been associated with trait fatigue in clinical populations, such as stroke survivors, suffering from chronic fatigue (De Doncker et al., 2020)6. This may be explained within the proposed model as follows: lower precision estimates in prior beliefs at higher levels emerging with (exertional) fatigue (reflecting increasing uncertainty in model predictions) cause greater prediction error at lower levels. Perception of effort is associated with movement or action costs, reflecting high gain, or insufficient attenuation, of action-induced prediction error (Kuppuswamy, 2017), or more formally described under information theoretical principles, as the information cost of updating prior beliefs (Zénon et al., 2019). Therefore, the decline in precision estimates associated with fatigue form greater prediction error that generates a heightened perception of effort. What is not currently clear is whether, in healthy populations, the magnitude of fatigue experienced by an individual is directly proportional to the perceived effort during action. Further examination of the effect of increasing severity of fatigue on the perception of effort and the regulation of motor performance are warranted." "springer_us"
"1619" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "It is recognised that assessment of an individual’s interoceptive ability can span various dimensions, including the accuracy of one’s interoceptive judgments, self-reported confidence in those judgements and also insight into those judgements, i.e., metacognitive evaluation of the correspondence between objective accuracy and confidence in the accuracy of those judgements (Garfinkel et al., 2015; Garfinkel & Critchley, 2013; see also Khalsa et al., 2018). Despite its clear relevance to exertional fatigue and performance fatigability (McMorris et al., 2018; Robertson & Marino, 2016), studies on the effect of individuals’ (conscious and nonconscious) awareness of physiological states on perception and performance during physical exertion are sparse, conflicting and presently limited to measures of interoceptive accuracy (da Silva Machado et al., 2019; Herbert et al., 2007; Köteles et al., 2020). How an individual’s insight into representations of interoceptive signals influences acute physical exertion and the development of fatigue is currently unknown. Although yet to be empirically tested, it is possible that an individual’s interoceptive insight may change the relationship between a perceived state of fatigue and other perceptions arising from prediction error, such as the perception of effort, during physical exertion. That is, those who are more aware of the accuracy of their interoceptive judgments may experience smaller, relative reductions in precision beliefs under conditions of fatigue, therefore attenuating the rise in prediction error and the perception of effort. In line with this hypothesis, interoceptive insight has been shown to reduce one’s susceptibility to an exteroceptive manipulation of self-location (Bekrater-Bodmann et al., 2020), suggesting that precise higher-order representations of the body are effective at limiting the influence of (exteroceptive) prediction error on belief updates. Evaluation of how conscious insight into interoceptive representations of bodily shapes this relationship may help further define how metacognitive processes influence subjective experiences aroused during acute fatiguing exertion."

"1620" "10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x" "The neuroanatomical circuits supporting the development of pathological fatigue based on metacognitive detection of persistent interoceptive prediction-error have been proposed (see Stephan et al., 2016; “Neuroanatomy of interoceptive monitoring during physical exertion – neurophysiological evidence ” section). Functional resting-state connectivity and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) provides a potential means of establishing interactions between the nodes within this metacognitive interoception-network in response to fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016). Similar methods have recently been used to quantify changes in effective connectivity with the development of fatigue during protracted cognitive tasks (Wylie et al., 2020) and have indicated abnormal inhibition between hemispheres as a factor in the development of persistent fatigue in people with stroke (Ondobaka et al., 2019). In the context of the present model, it may be expected that an increased connectivity between visceromotor and prefrontal regions of the putative interoceptive metacognition network and primary interoceptive cortex (posterior insula cortex) (Barrett & Simmons, 2015) occurs as participants monitor the presence of dyshomeostasis during physical exertion. However, whether changes in effective connectivity between key nodes is associated with the development of exertional fatigue has yet to be elucidated." "springer_us"

Fundamentally, whether developing in response to pathology or as an acute, transient state during physical exertion, the experience of fatigue is a product of inference associated with an increased uncertainty in one’s capacity to accurately predict and control sensory states. This framework is fundamentally entrenched within current conceptualisations of how the brain works. We hope that with this article we have highlighted and indeed emphasised the potential of predictive processing to provide a common framework for the study of fatigue across health and disease."
