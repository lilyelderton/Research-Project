AB  - N-Methyl-d-Aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis is a disease 
      discovered two decades ago. Our knowledge about it has recently deepened 
      dramatically. However, the significance of NMDAR antibodies in psychiatric 
      disease cannot be determined if there are no clear indications of brain 
      inflammation or an autoimmune encephalitis mediated by NMDAR antibodies. 
      Furthermore, the long-term interaction and connection between these two disease 
      entities are unclear. In this paper we aim to elucidate the relationship between 
      these disease entities. We propose two distinct models that explain the on the 
      one hand a condition in which a minor inflammatory state as in psychiatric 
      disease culminates in a severe state of inflammation characterized by NMDAR 
      encephalitis. On the other hand, we postulate a model in which an NMDAR 
      encephalitis might later create favorable conditions for inducing psychiatric 
      disease. These models should be kept in mind for further investigations examining 
      the long-term outcome of NMDAR autoantibody immunity in the brain and its 
      functions.

AB  - The prevalence of stress-related comorbidities is increased approximately 3-fold 
      in cancer patients compared to the general population. There is a scarcity of 
      research focusing on the biological brain changes caused by the cancer due to the 
      assumption that psychological symptoms are solely caused by the stress of a 
      cancer diagnosis. Recent clinical evidence indicates that declines in cognition 
      and increases in mood symptoms occur prior to an individual receiving a cancer 
      diagnosis, suggesting that the cancer itself may play a role in mediating 
      biological brain change. Furthermore, the presence of a tumour may change the 
      brain response to environmental stressors unrelated to a cancer diagnosis. Using 
      a syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we compared the impact of 
      mammary tumours and chronic restraint stress on microglial and astrocytic 
      activation throughout stress-relevant neurocircuitry. We also examined whether 
      changes in microglial and astrocytic activation overlapped with changes in 
      chronic neuronal activity. We show that cancer and chronic restraint stress 
      activates microglia to the same magnitude in the same subcortical brain regions, 
      and that this activation correlates with stress coping behaviours. The findings 
      suggest that in some cancer patients, microglia may be activated in brain regions 
      involved in interpreting and responding to psychological distress before they are 
      aware of their diagnosis. In contrast, cancer reduced astrocyte reactivity in two 
      cortical brain regions where there were no clear changes in response to chronic 
      restraint stress. Taken together, it is likely that interventions that aim to 
      improve anxiety and stress in cancer patients by targeting glial responses to 
      cancer would need to be cell-specific; reducing microglial activation and/or 
      stimulating astrocytic activation.

TI  - Immunopsychiatry of Infected Ears, Sinuses, Skulls, and Meninges: Mast Cells, 
      Mozart, Van Gogh.
PG  - 265-275
AB  - Medical psychiatry acquires more prominence in the biological field by new 
      anatomical insights into the wrappings of the brain: meninges, but also 
      Meningo-Calvarial Channels (MCCs) connecting the former with the bone marrows' 
      also neuronally steered, functions. The skull-bone's meningeal arteries through 
      migrating and orchestrating mast cells within a framework stressing their 
      relations with arteries (Treviranus 2012-21) could explain enigmatic phenomena 
      like migrainous and post-injury Cortical Spreading Depressions (CSD) or the 
      Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) escalating to "PRES". The 
      skull might be accessed along chronic (para-)infectious paths resulting in Skull 
      Bone Osteomyelitis (SBO) from the ear-nose-throat, dental and other microbiomes. 
      Such paths seem promoted by compromised innate immune defenses: by "Mendelian" 
      susceptibility, and/or acquired anti-INF-γ- or other auto-immunity or various 
      microbial "Trojans" of e. g. meningeal myelo- and lymphocytes. These interact e. 
      g. from the calvarial marrow niches onward. Hereby competing local and 
      "intentional" intruding mast cells - by disturbing (or ingeniously boosting) 
      cortical development and functioning - acquire relevance by interacting with 
      arteries (Treviranus 2018, 2021). This predicts findings in behavior (Fitzpatrick 
      & Morrow 2017) an "aortal" arterial biomechanical foundation of parasympathetic 
      reverse arterio-intramural cerebro-interstitial drainage by CIMURAF/IPAD-2.0 
      (Treviranus 2018-21). Here the recent physiological re-conceptions of the skull 
      illuminate own case histories through a gamut of possibly relevant 
      neuro(-surgico)-psychiatric challenges. Among these meningo-cerebral immune, 
      vasospastic, and cystic processes some generate broad "experiential" 
      hallucinations, which may slowly transit to true psychoses through "perfect crime 
      lesions" of neurons and glia by tryptase-armed mast cells descending into 
      parenchyma often congested by "push-back". These emerging hypotheses coalesce in 
      advancing an integrative macro-medical psychiatry and even the pathography of Van 
      Gogh and Mozart stressing the benign and creative roles of mast cells.

TI  - Dietary intake in children on the autism spectrum is altered and linked to 
      differences in autistic traits and sensory processing styles.
PG  - 1824-1839
LID - 10.1002/aur.2798 [doi]
AB  - Diets of children and adolescents on the autism spectrum often differ when 
      compared to their non-autistic peers. Most dietary studies have been limited by 
      small sample sizes and rarely assess the heterogeneity of autism. Addressing this 
      gap, this study compared the anthropometrics, dietary composition, dietary 
      quality, and food variety of 154 Australian children and adolescents on the 
      spectrum and 213 non-autistic children (71 siblings and 142 unrelated controls). 
      Beyond the case-control approach, within-group comparisons assessed the influence 
      of autism clinical presentations and sensory processing styles on body mass index 
      (BMI) and measures of dietary intake among those on the spectrum. In this word 
      first study of diet that included between-group comparisons with non-autistic 
      peers (siblings and an unrelated comparison group) and within-autism group 
      comparisons, we found that children on the spectrum consumed limited variety and 
      lower quality of food and non-autistic siblings also ate comparably higher levels 
      of energy-dense, nutrient poor food, and less diary. This may be due to autistic 
      traits influencing family's diets or shared sensory sensitivities driving dietary 
      intake. Within the autism group, higher autistic traits were associated with 
      lower BMIs and a specific dietary pattern higher in simple carbohydrates and 
      lower in unprocessed protein. Contrastingly, greater sensitivity to sensory 
      stimuli was associated with a healthier diet. Increased age was linked to more 
      varied diets but also diets higher in saturated fats and energy-dense, nutrient 
      poor foods. Overall, this research highlights that potential mediators of dietary 
      intake, such as familial influences, autistic traits, sensory processing styles, 
      age and sex, need to be considered when assessing diet in the autistic 
      population. LAY SUMMARY: In this study of dietary differences linked to autism, 
      children, and teenagers on the spectrum ate fewer different foods and were less 
      likely to eat recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables when compared to 
      non-autistic siblings and unrelated children and teenagers. There were also 
      family differences, in that those on the spectrum and their siblings ate more 
      unhealthy foods and less dairy. Among those on the spectrum, dietary differences 
      were linked to age, sex, autistic traits and sensory processing styles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is a novel 
      field in immunopsychiatry that has been attracting attention thanks to its 
      potentially positive therapeutic outcome and distinct prognosis compared with 
      non-organic psychiatric disease. This review aims to describe recent novel 
      technological developments for improving diagnostics in the field of 
      autoantibody-related psychiatric disease. METHODS: We screened for relevant 
      articles in PubMed for this narrative article. We focused on research methods 
      such as neuroimaging, immune cells and inflammation markers, and molecular 
      biomarkers in human biofluids like serum and cerebrospinal fluid and plasma 
      proteomics. RESULTS: We introduce several novel methods for investigating 
      autoinflammation with the aim of optimizing therapies for autoantibody-associated 
      psychiatric disease. We describe measuring the translocator protein 18kDa in 
      activated microglia via positron emission tomography imaging, brain volumetric 
      assessment, flow cell cytometry of cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and blood 
      biological probes as well as psychopathological cues to help us gain insights 
      into diagnosing inflammation and brain damage better in psychiatric patients 
      presenting a suspected autoimmune etiology. CONCLUSION: Our short methodological 
      review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of 
      autoantibody-related immunopsychiatry. More research is needed to prove their 
      usefulness in diagnosing and treating autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease 
      and its subtypes.

AB  - From genetic and etiological studies, autoimmune mechanisms underlying 
      schizophrenia are suspected; however, the details remain unclear. In this study, 
      we describe autoantibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) in 
      patients with schizophrenia (5.4%, cell-based assay; 6.7%, ELISA) in a Japanese 
      cohort (n = 223). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody disrupts both NCAM1-NCAM1 and 
      NCAM1-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interactions. 
      Furthermore, the anti-NCAM1 antibody purified from patients with schizophrenia 
      interrupts NCAM1-Fyn interaction and inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and 
      ERK1 when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice and also reduces the 
      number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex. In addition, it induces 
      schizophrenia-related behavior in mice, including deficient pre-pulse inhibition 
      and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients 
      with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses 
      in mice. These antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target and serve as a 
      biomarker to distinguish a small but treatable subgroup in heterogeneous patients 
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - Disrupting circadian rhythms promotes cancer-induced inflammation in mice.
PG  - 100428

LID - 100428
AB  - Disruption of circadian rhythms occurs in rotating shift-work, jetlag, and in 
      individuals with irregular sleep schedules. Circadian disruption is known to 
      alter inflammatory responses and impair immune function. However, there is 
      limited understanding of how circadian disruption modulates cancer-induced 
      inflammation. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and is linked to worse 
      prognosis and impaired brain function in cancer patients. Here, we investigated 
      the effect of circadian disruption on cancer-induced inflammation in an 
      orthotopic breast cancer model. Using a validated chronic jetlag protocol that 
      advances the light-cycle by 8 ​h every 2 days to disrupt circadian rhythms, we 
      found that circadian disruption alters cancer-induced inflammation in a 
      tissue-specific manner, increasing inflammation in the body and brain while 
      decreasing inflammation within the tumor tissue. Circadian disruption did not 
      affect inflammation in mice without tumors, suggesting that the impact of 
      circadian disruption may be particularly detrimental in the context of underlying 
      inflammatory conditions, such as cancer. Importantly, circadian disruption did 
      not affect tumor burden, suggesting that increased inflammation was not a result 
      of increased cancer progression. Overall, these findings identify the importance 
      of healthy circadian rhythms for limiting cancer-induced inflammation.

AB  - Yoga is an ancient system for integrating the mind, body, and spirit. In the 
      hatha yoga ashtanga tradition (the eight limb Patanjali Yoga), three of the limbs 
      are meditation, breathwork (pranayama) and physical postures (asana), which are 
      widely practised in yoga classes. The benefits of yoga for mental and physical 
      health are rooted in the practice's origins: in yoga, stress is said to be the 
      root of all diseases. The established fields of psychoneuroimmunology and 
      immunopsychiatry study the interplay between the immune system and mood or mental 
      states. This mini-review has shifted the emphasis from research that focuses on 
      yoga's benefits for stress, the most commonly studied outcome of yoga research, 
      to a summary of the research on the effects of yoga practices on the immune 
      system. The current literature bears strong evidence for the benefits of yoga on 
      the levels of circulating cortisol and classical inflammatory markers, such as 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), 
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma 
      (INF-γ). The evidence for other less studied markers, telomerase activity, 
      β-endorphins, Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      is also growing. This mini-review centres around the interplay between yoga and 
      these markers in stress management and depression, vascular and immune function 
      in the older population, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, auto-immune 
      diseases, breast cancer and pregnancy. Overall, the literature examined reveals 
      the novelty of this field of research and sheds light on methodological 
      challenges; however, it uncovers the potential for yoga to be used as adjuvant 
      therapy in conditions with an inflammatory component.

PG  - 155-167
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2022.2038136 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a group of immune-mediated 
      inflammatory processes of the brain with marked psychiatric features. Although 
      relatively rare, they might offer difficult differential diagnosis with 
      psychiatric conditions, especially catatonia and psychotic syndromes. 
      Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common AIE, 
      presenting with psychiatric syndromes in 90% of cases. The associated 
      psychopathology is complex, pleomorphic, and best characterized when there is 
      involvement of a psychiatrist in the assessment. AREAS COVERED: This text will 
      review the main aspects of AIE to psychiatrists and/or neuropsychiatrists. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Immune system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
      psychiatric symptoms and disorders. The use of diagnostic criteria for possible 
      AIE, especially when specific antibodies of AIE are not available, allows early 
      diagnosis and prompt treatment which are associated with better clinical 
      outcomes. The study of the psychiatric aspects of AIE can broaden our knowledge 
      of the underlying mechanisms of various psychiatric manifestations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience increased risk of death from accident and 
      suicide. Cognitive impairment induced by cancer-related inflammation and 
      stress-related psychiatric symptoms may be underlying mechanisms. We therefore 
      studied the association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) and risk of these outcomes. METHODS: Following a cohort of 388,443 
      cancer patients diagnosed between October 2005 and December 2014 in Sweden, we 
      ascertained dispense of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before cancer 
      diagnosis onward and defined the on-medication period as from date of drug 
      dispense until the prescribed dosage was consumed. Follow-up time outside 
      medicated periods and time from unexposed patients were defined as off-medication 
      periods. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death due to 
      suicide or accident, by comparing the on-medication periods with off-medication 
      periods. RESULTS: In total, 29.7% of the cancer patients had low-dose aspirin 
      dispensed and 29.1% had non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed. Patients with aspirin use 
      were more likely to be male than patients without aspirin use. Compared with 
      off-medication periods, there was a 22% lower risk of accidental death (N = 651; 
      HR 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 to 0.87) during on-medication periods 
      with aspirin. The use of aspirin was not associated with risk of suicide (N = 59; 
      HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.39). No association was noted between use of 
      non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of suicide (N = 13; HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.42 to 
      2.18) or accidental death (N = 59; HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Intake of low-dose aspirin after cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower 
      risk of unnatural deaths among cancer patients.

AB  - Neuroimmunology in the broadest sense is the study of interactions between the 
      nervous and the immune systems. These interactions play important roles in health 
      from supporting neural development, homeostasis and plasticity to modifying 
      behaviour. Neuroimmunology is increasingly recognised as a field with the 
      potential to deliver a significant positive impact on human health and treatment 
      for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, translation to the clinic is 
      hindered by fundamental knowledge gaps on the underlying mechanisms of action or 
      the optimal timing of an intervention, and a lack of appropriate tools to 
      visualise and modulate both systems. Here we propose ten key disease-agnostic 
      research questions that, if addressed, could lead to significant progress within 
      neuroimmunology in the short to medium term. We also discuss four cross-cutting 
      themes to be considered when addressing each question: i) bi-directionality of 
      neuroimmune interactions; ii) the biological context in which the questions are 
      addressed (e.g. health vs disease vs across the lifespan); iii) tools and 
      technologies required to fully answer the questions; and iv) translation into the 
      clinic. We acknowledge that these ten questions cannot represent the full breadth 
      of gaps in our understanding; rather they focus on areas which, if addressed, may 
      have the most broad and immediate impacts. By defining these neuroimmunology 
      priorities, we hope to unite existing and future research teams, who can make 
      meaningful progress through a collaborative and cross-disciplinary effort.

TI  - Toward the unity of pathological and exertional fatigue: A predictive processing 
      model.
PG  - 215-228

AB  - Fatigue is a common experience in both health and disease. Yet, pathological 
      (i.e., prolonged or chronic) and transient (i.e., exertional) fatigue symptoms 
      are traditionally considered distinct, compounding a separation between 
      interested research fields within the study of fatigue. Within the clinical 
      neurosciences, nascent frameworks position pathological fatigue as a product of 
      inference derived through hierarchical predictive processing. The metacognitive 
      theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al., 2016) states that pathological fatigue 
      emerges from the metacognitive mechanism in which the detection of persistent 
      mismatches between prior interoceptive predictions and ascending sensory evidence 
      (i.e., prediction error) signals low evidence for internal generative models, 
      which undermine an agent's feeling of mastery over the body and is thus 
      experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Although acute, transient subjective 
      symptoms of exertional fatigue have also been associated with increasing 
      interoceptive prediction error, the dynamic computations that underlie its 
      development have not been clearly defined. Here, drawing on the metacognitive 
      theory of dyshomeostasis, we extend this account to offer an explicit description 
      of the development of fatigue during extended periods of (physical) exertion. 
      Accordingly, it is proposed that a loss of certainty or confidence in control 
      predictions in response to persistent detection of prediction error features as a 
      common foundation for the conscious experience of both pathological and 
      nonpathological fatigue.

AB  - Most researchers working in the field of immunopsychiatry would agree with the 
      statement that "severe psychiatric disorders are associated with inflammation and 
      more broadly with changes in immune variables". However, as many other fields in 
      biology and medicine, immunopsychiatry suffers from a replication crisis 
      characterized by lack of reproducibility. In this paper, we will comment on four 
      types of immune variables which have been studied in psychiatric disorders: Acute 
      Phase Proteins (AAPs), cytokines, lipid mediators of inflammation and immune cell 
      parameters, and discuss the rationale for looking at them in blood. We will 
      briefly describe the analytical methods that are currently used to measure the 
      levels of these biomarkers and comment on overlooked analytical and statistical 
      methodological issues that may explain some of the conflicting data reported in 
      the literature. Lastly, we will briefly summarize what cross-sectional, 
      longitudinal and mendelian randomization studies have brought to our 
      understanding of schizophrenia (SZ).

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear how to best measure the complex symptom presentation of 
      pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). METHODS: 
      Well-characterized participants of a 2-5 year follow-up study (n = 34; 56% male) 
      underwent clinical evaluations and completed scales assessing global symptom 
      severity, functional impairment and specific psychiatric symptoms. We explored 
      inter-correlations between the measures and used intraclass correlation 
      coefficients to evaluate the agreement between clinician-, parent- and child 
      ratings of the same constructs. RESULTS: Ratings on symptom-specific measures 
      varied largely between participants. Agreement between informants was excellent 
      on functional scales, fair-to-moderate on global severity scales and mixed on 
      symptom-specific scales. Clinician-rated global and functional measures had 
      stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than 
      with symptom-specific measures. CONCLUSIONS: General instruments assessing global 
      severity and functioning are well suited for the assessment and follow-up of 
      PANS, but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of 
      core symptoms.

LID - 100314
AB  - Psychoneuroimmunology, the area of research dedicated to understanding the 
      fundamental interactions between the central nervous system and the immune 
      system, has given rise to the development of Immunopsychiatry, a new discipline 
      which harnesses the immune system to produce beneficial outcomes for mental 
      health problems. Immunopsychiatry has the potential to become a clinically 
      relevant specialty area in psychiatric practice, but has not yet been adopted by 
      the wider mental health community. This paper aims to map out the future 
      trajectory of Immunopsychiatry on its road towards science-to-policy knowledge 
      translation and clinical implementation. Three critical milestones which will 
      need to be reached in order for Immunopsychiatry to fulfil its promise for 
      clinical innovation are discussed: a clear definition of patients who fall within 
      the immunopsychiatric continuum; demonstration of well-defined clinical benefit 
      and incorporation in clinical guidelines; and convergence with other paradigms in 
      biological psychiatry.

AB  - Immunopsychiatry is a subfield of psychoneuroimmunology that integrates 
      immunological and psychopathological processes with promise for improving the 
      classification, identification, and treatment of psychopathology. Using research 
      on the relationship between inflammation and depression as a running example, 
      this mini-review will discuss three areas of work that should be emphasized in 
      future research to maximize the replicability and clinical impact of the field: 
      1) methodology with respect to planning data collection and statistical analyses 
      with measurement properties and conceptually important sources of variance in 
      mind, 2) characterizing inflammatory phenotypes of psychopathology, and 3) the 
      integration of inflammatory processes into robust, extant psychosocial 
      theoretical frameworks of psychopathology risk. Consistent, parallel growth in 
      all three areas will ensure immunopsychiatry research is replicable, contributes 
      to understanding of how (and for whom) the immune system is associated with 
      psychiatric symptoms, and increases the flexibility and power of personalized 
      treatment planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental disorders might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We aimed 
      to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and 
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental 
      disorder, and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders, and exposure to 
      psychopharmacological drug classes. METHODS: In this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis, we searched Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and PsycINFO 
      databases between Jan 1, 2020, and March 5, 2021, for original studies reporting 
      data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with 
      controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples, studies that were not 
      peer-reviewed, and studies written in languages other than English, Danish, 
      Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects 
      meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 
      infection as the primary outcome, and hospitalisation and ICU admission as 
      secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity 
      was assessed using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was tested with Egger 
      regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to 
      assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to 
      assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to 
      assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, 
      pandemic phase, quality assessment score, sample sizes, and adjustment for 
      confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021233984. FINDINGS: 
      841 studies were identified by the systematic search, of which 33 studies were 
      included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 
      1 469 731 patients with COVID-19, of whom 43 938 had mental disorders. The sample 
      included 130 807 females (8·9% of the whole sample) and 130 373 males (8·8%). 
      Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity, and 22 studies were 
      rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an 
      increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 2·00 [95% CI 1·58-2·54]; I(2)=92·66%). 
      This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (2·05 [1·37-3·06]; 
      I(2)=80·81%), mood disorders (1·99 [1·46-2·71]; I(2)=68·32%), substance use 
      disorders (1·76 [1·27-2·44]; I(2)=47·90%), and intellectual disabilities and 
      developmental disorders (1·73 [1·29-2·31]; I(2)=90·15%) but not for anxiety 
      disorders (1·07 [0·73-1·56]; I(2)=11·05%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with 
      exposure to antipsychotics (3·71 [1·74-7·91]; I(2)=90·31%), anxiolytics (2·58 
      [1·22-5·44]; I(2)=96·42%), and antidepressants (2·23 [1·06-4·71]; I(2)=95·45%). 
      For psychotic disorders, mood disorders, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, the 
      association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and other 
      confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of 
      hospitalisation (2·24 [1·70-2·94]; I(2)=88·80%). No significant associations with 
      mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and 
      meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment 
      setting (p=0·013) and country (p<0·0001) with mortality. No significant 
      associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of 
      publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude 
      mortality and hospitalisation, and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission. 
      INTERPRETATION: Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood 
      disorders, and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with 
      COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models. Although further research 
      is required to determine the underlying mechanisms, our findings highlight the 
      need for targeted approaches to manage and prevent COVID-19 in at-risk patient 
      groups identified in this study. FUNDING: None. TRANSLATIONS: For the Italian,

TI  - Neuroinflammation in Major Depressive Disorder: A Review of PET Imaging Studies 
      Examining the 18-kDa Translocator Protein.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric disorder 
      whose pathological mechanisms are largely unknown. In the field of 
      immuno-psychiatry, several evidences suggested a prominent role of inflammation 
      in MDD not only in peripheral immune system but also in the brain. To date, brain 
      inflammation is traceable in vivo with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), 
      through the quantification of the expression of 18-kda Translocator Protein 
      (TSPO) by active microglia. In this context, this review aimed to summarize the 
      results of all in vivo PET imaging studies that evaluated microglia activation in 
      MDD. METHODS: A bibliographic search in PubMed up to June 2020 was performed. A 
      total of 9 studies that used first and second generation TSPO radiotracers met 
      our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Overall the results suggested the presence of 
      TSPO upregulation in MDD, especially in anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal 
      cortex, hippocampal formation and insula. Notably, from a therapeutic point of 
      view, results suggested that the symptoms amelioration, caused by both 
      antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy, may be accompanied 
      by reduced inflammatory status in the brain. Finally, a positive effect of the 
      anti-inflammatory treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor has also been 
      observed. LIMITATIONS: The heterogeneity across the studies in experimental 
      designs, sample selection and methods limited the studies comparison. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings supported the presence of neuroinflammation in MDD, 
      suggesting that microgliosis may be an important pathophysiological mechanism 
      that merits further investigation as a potential target for novel treatment 
      strategies.

AB  - The multifaceted role of low-grade systemic inflammation in depression and 
      physical illnesses like cardiovascular disease highlights complex interactions 
      between the body, brain and mind. While current research on inflammation and 
      depression has largely focused on exploring possible disease mechanisms and 
      therapeutic potential, we seek to broaden the current discussion by introducing a 
      public health perspective. In this Viewpoint, we propose that inflammation and 
      its contributing sources could represent important targets for public health 
      strategies aimed at improving both mental and physical health. We discuss 
      potential universal, selective and indicated primary prevention strategies for 
      inflammation-related depression. We consider potential approaches to secondary 
      prevention, including scope for anti-inflammatory treatment and CRP testing for 
      guiding treatment allocation and prognosis. Preventive strategies discussed here 
      could also be relevant for other inflammation-mediated mental health conditions.

TI  - An expanding manifold in transmodal regions characterizes adolescent 
      reconfiguration of structural connectome organization.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.64694 [doi]
LID - e64694
AB  - Adolescence is a critical time for the continued maturation of brain networks. 
      Here, we assessed structural connectome development in a large longitudinal 
      sample ranging from childhood to young adulthood. By projecting high-dimensional 
      connectomes into compact manifold spaces, we identified a marked expansion of 
      structural connectomes, with strongest effects in transmodal regions during 
      adolescence. Findings reflected increased within-module connectivity together 
      with increased segregation, indicating increasing differentiation of higher-order 
      association networks from the rest of the brain. Projection of 
      subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into these manifolds showed parallel 
      alterations in pathways centered on the caudate and thalamus. Connectome findings 
      were contextualized via spatial transcriptome association analysis, highlighting 
      genes enriched in cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Statistical learning of 
      cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their maturational 
      change predicted measures of intelligence at follow-up. Our findings demonstrate 
      that connectome manifold learning can bridge the conceptual and empirical gaps 
      between macroscale network reconfigurations, microscale processes, and cognitive 
      outcomes in adolescent development.

TI  - Applicability, potential and limitations of TSPO PET imaging as a clinical 
      immunopsychiatry biomarker.
PG  - 164-173
LID - 10.1007/s00259-021-05308-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: TSPO PET imaging may hold promise as a single-step diagnostic work-up 
      for clinical immunopsychiatry. This review paper on the clinical applicability of 
      TSPO PET for primary psychiatric disorders discusses if and why TSPO PET imaging 
      might become the first clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker and the investment 
      prerequisites and scientific advancements needed to accommodate this transition 
      from bench to bedside. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the 
      literature to identify clinical studies of TSPO PET imaging in patients with 
      primary psychiatric disorders. We included both original case-control studies as 
      well as longitudinal cohort studies of patients with a primary psychiatric 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: Thirty-one original studies met our inclusion criteria. In 
      the field of immunopsychiatry, TSPO PET has until now mostly been studied in 
      schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, and to a lesser extent in mood 
      disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantitative TSPO PET appears most 
      promising as a predictive biomarker for the transdiagnostic identification of 
      subgroups or disease stages that could benefit from immunological treatments, or 
      as a prognostic biomarker forecasting patients' illness course. Current scanning 
      protocols are still too unreliable, impractical and invasive for clinical use in 
      symptomatic psychiatric patients. CONCLUSION: TSPO PET imaging in its present 
      form does not yet offer a sufficiently attractive cost-benefit ratio to become a 
      clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker. Its translation to psychiatric clinical 
      practice will depend on the prioritising of longitudinal research and the 
      establishment of a uniform protocol rendering clinically meaningful TSPO uptake 
      quantification at the shortest possible scan duration without arterial 
      cannulation.

AB  - This prospective service evaluation aimed to determine if integrated 
      psychological support for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) enhanced 
      outcomes. 75 patients were assessed and treated by a specialist liaison 
      psychiatric service between 2015 and 2017; 43 received psychiatric intervention 
      alone, 32 were referred for psychological intervention by clinical health 
      psychologist; 26 completed this. Pre-post data (n=15 available) included global 
      impression, quality of life, and psychiatric and IBD symptom scores. 
      Referrer/patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness were retrospectively 
      calculated. Psychological intervention led to reductions in IBD symptoms (ΔSIBD; 
      p=0.003), alongside improvements in depression scores (ΔPHQ-9, p=0.006) and 
      global impression (ΔCGI; p=0.046). Patient/referrer satisfaction was very high. 
      Indicative data comparing service utilisation 1 year before and after engagement 
      found reductions in outpatient appointments and in imaging. This small study 
      suggests consideration of increased access to integrated psychological support 
      services to improve outcomes and gather further evidence of efficacy.

      Cohort.
PG  - 354-364
LID - 10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the long-term prognosis of children with pediatric 
      acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Out of the 46 eligible patients 
      from the Karolinska PANS cohort, 34 consented to participate in a follow-up 
      (median 3.3 years). Participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation and 
      were classified according to their clinical course. Resulting groups were 
      compared on clinical characteristics and laboratory test results. We observed 
      significant reductions in clinician-rated PANS symptom severity and improved 
      general function. Two patients were classified as remitted, 20 as 
      relapsing-remitting, and 12 as having a chronic-static/progressive course. The 
      latter group had an earlier onset, greater impairment and received more 
      pharmacological and psychological treatments. Although remission was rare, the 
      majority of children with PANS were significantly improved over the follow-up 
      period but a non-negligible minority of patients displayed a 
      chronic-static/progressive course and required additional treatments. The 
      proposed definitions of flare and clinical course may be useful in future 
      clinical trials.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raising global 
      anxiety and fear of both real and perceived health threat from the virus. 
      Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric 
      complications, suggesting that the "psychoneuroimmunity" model might be 
      beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special 
      Issue on "Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic" was launched immediately after 
      the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020. 
      A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 
      2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special 
      Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological 
      manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on 
      COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation 
      are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central 
      and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders, 
      encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A "three-steps" Neuro-COVID 
      infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. 
      The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive 
      intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion. 
      Psychological support should be implemented, improving the psychological 
      wellbeing, as well as to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.

TI  - Relationship Between Serum NMDA Receptor Antibodies and Response to Antipsychotic 
      Treatment in First-Episode Psychosis.
PG  - 9-15
LID - S0006-3223(20)32075-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.11.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When psychosis develops in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibody 
      encephalitis, it usually has an acute or subacute onset, and antipsychotic 
      treatment may be ineffective and associated with adverse effects. Serum NMDAR 
      antibodies have been reported in a minority of patients with first-episode 
      psychosis (FEP), but their role in psychosis onset and response to antipsychotic 
      treatment is unclear. METHODS: Sera from 387 patients with FEP (duration of 
      psychosis <2 years, minimally or never treated with antipsychotics) undergoing 
      initial treatment with amisulpride as part of the OPTiMiSE (Optimization of 
      Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in Europe) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      number NCT01248195) were tested for NMDAR IgG antibodies using a live cell-based 
      assay. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
      Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale at baseline and again after 4 
      weeks of treatment with amisulpride. RESULTS: At baseline, 15 patients were 
      seropositive for NMDAR antibodies and 372 were seronegative. The seropositive 
      patients had similar symptom profiles and demographic features to seronegative 
      patients but a shorter duration of psychosis (median 1.5 vs. 4.0 months; p = 
      .031). Eleven seropositive and 284 seronegative patients completed 4 weeks of 
      amisulpride treatment: after treatment, there was no between-groups difference in 
      improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores or in the frequency of 
      adverse medication effects. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in FEP, NMDAR 
      antibody seropositivity alone is not an indication for using immunotherapy 
      instead of antipsychotic medications. Further studies are required to establish 
      what proportion of patients with FEP who are NMDAR antibody seropositive have 
      coexisting cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory changes or other paraclinical 
      evidence suggestive of a likely benefit from immunotherapy.

AB  - A growing number of studies are pointing out the need for a conceptual shift from 
      a brain-centered to a body-inclusive approach in mental health research. In this 
      perspective, the link between the immune and the nervous system, which are deeply 
      interconnected and continuously interacting, is one of the most important novel 
      theoretical framework to investigate the biological bases of major depressive 
      disorder and, more in general, mental illness. Indeed, depressed patients show 
      high levels of inflammatory markers, administration of pro-inflammatory drugs 
      triggers a depressive symptomatology and antidepressant efficacy is reduced by 
      excessive immune system activation. A number of molecular and cellular mechanisms 
      have been hypothesized to act as a link between the immune and brain function, 
      thus representing potential pharmacologically targetable processes for the 
      development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies. These include the 
      modulation of the kynurenine pathway, the crosstalk between metabolic and 
      inflammatory processes, the imbalance in acquired immune responses, in particular 
      T cell responses, and the interplay between neural plasticity and immune system 
      activation. In the personalized medicine approach, the assessment and regulation 
      of these processes have the potential to lead, respectively, to novel diagnostic 
      approaches for the prediction of treatment outcome according to the patient's 
      immunological profile, and to improved efficacy of antidepressant compounds 
      through immune modulation.

AB  - Inflammation has been proposed to play a causal role in chemobrain which-if 
      true-would represent an opportunity to repurpose existing anti-inflammatory drugs 
      for the prevention and treatment of chemobrain. Here, we show that the chemoagent 
      paclitaxel induces memory impairment and anhedonia in mice within 24 h of 
      treatment cessation, but inflammation is not present until 2 weeks after 
      treatment. We find no evidence of brain inflammation as measured by cytokine 
      analysis at any time point. Furthermore, treating with aspirin to block 
      inflammation did not affect paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. These findings 
      suggest that inflammation may not be responsible for memory impairment induced by 
      paclitaxel. These results contrast with recent findings of a causal role for 
      inflammation in cancer-induced memory deficits in mice that were prevented by 
      treatment with oral aspirin, suggesting that cognitive impairment in cancer 
      patients undergoing treatment may arise from multiple convergent mechanisms.

TI  - How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values and regularization 
      influences CRP and depression criteria associations in network analyses.

AB  - Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than 
      diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network 
      analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify 
      associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all 
      other variables modeled. However, investigation into how methodological decisions 
      (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) 
      >10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary 
      to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. 
      In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for 
      associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite and some support for 
      additional CRP-criterion associations. Methodologically, results consistently 
      demonstrated that including individuals with CRP >10 mg/L and estimating 
      nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Thus, we 
      recommend considering the use of nonregularized networks in immunopsychiatry and 
      inclusion of cases with CRP values >10 mg/L when testing the association between 
      CRP and depression criteria, unless contraindicated by the research question 
      being tested. Additionally, results most consistently suggest that CRP is 
      uniquely related to fatigue and changes in appetite, supporting their inclusion 
      in an immunometabolic phenotype of depression. Finally, these associations 
      suggest that fatigue and changes in appetite might be particularly receptive to 
      anti-inflammatory treatments. However, future research with more nuanced measures 
      is necessary to parse out whether appetite increases or decreases drive this 
      association. Further, longitudinal research is an important next step to test how 
      these relationships manifest over time.

AB  - Increased plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to acute hypoglycemia 
      have been well documented. Aiming to study the interaction between IL-6 and 
      counter-regulatory hormones during hypoglycemic stress we conducted an 
      exploratory single center study involving 26 adult patients undergoing insulin 
      tolerance test. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia elicited a significant dynamic 
      response of IL-6, adrenaline, noradrenaline, GH, prolactin, ACTH and serum and 
      salivary cortisol (P < 0.001 for all variables). Patients with insufficient HPA 
      axis response had lower hypoglycemia-induced IL-6 increase (median: 0.88 pg/mL) 
      compared with individuals with intact HPA axis response (2.03 pg/mL, P = 0.007). 
      IL-6 maximal increase correlated with the maximal increase of serum cortisol 
      (r(s) = 0.48; P = 0.013), salivary cortisol (r(s) = 0.66; P = 0.012), plasma ACTH 
      (r(s) = 0.48; P = 0.013) and with the increase in procedure-related symptoms of 
      anxiety and hypoglycemia (r(s) = 0.57; P = 0.003). In conclusion, hypoglycemic 
      stress-induced IL-6 increase is associated with activation of the HPA axis, 
      suggesting that IL-6 response to hypoglycemic stress may be regarded as part of 
      the counter-regulatory response, possibly contributing to the maintenance of 
      glucose homeostasis.

AB  - Immune system components also regulate synapse formation and refinement in 
      neurodevelopment. The complement pathway, associated with cell lysis and 
      phagocytosis, is implicated in synaptic elimination. Aberrant adolescent synaptic 
      pruning may underpin schizophrenia onset; thus, changes in cortical complement 
      activity during human development are of major interest. Complement is 
      genetically linked to schizophrenia via increased C4 copy number variants, but 
      the developmental trajectory of complement expression in the human brain is 
      undetermined. As complement increases during periods of active synaptic 
      engulfment in rodents, we hypothesized that complement expression would increase 
      during postnatal development in humans, particularly during adolescence. Using 
      human postmortem prefrontal cortex, we observed that complement activator (C1QB 
      and C3) transcripts peaked in early neurodevelopment, and were highest in 
      toddlers, declining in teenagers (all ANCOVAs between F = 2.41 -3.325, 
      p = .01-0.05). We found that C4 protein was higher at 1-5 years (H = 16.378, 
      p = .012), whereas C3 protein levels were unchanged with age. The microglial 
      complement receptor subunit CD11b increased in mRNA early in life and peaked in 
      the toddler brain (ANCOVA: pH, F = 4.186, p = .003). Complement inhibitors (CD46 
      and CD55) increased at school age, but failed to decrease like complement 
      activators (both ANCOVAs, F > 4.4, p < .01). These data suggest the activation of 
      complement in the human prefrontal cortex occurs between 1 and 5 years. We did 
      not find evidence of induction of complement factors during adolescence and 
      instead found increased or sustained levels of complement inhibitor mRNA at 
      maturation. Dysregulation of these typical patterns of complement may predispose 
      the brain to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or schizophrenia.

TI  - Longitudinal exploration of cancer-related cognitive impairment in patients with 
      newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma: protocol for a feasibility study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a distressing and 
      disabling side-effect of cancer treatments affecting up to 75% of patients. For 
      some patients, their cognitive impairment may be transient, but for a subgroup, 
      these symptoms can be long-standing and have a major impact on the quality of 
      life. This paper describes the protocol for a study: (1) to assess the 
      feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition via self-report, 
      neuropsychological testing, peripheral markers of inflammation and neuroimaging 
      and (2) to explore and describe patterns of cancer-related cognitive impairment 
      over the course of treatment and recovery in patients with newly diagnosed, 
      aggressive lymphoma undergoing standard therapy with curative intent. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, feasibility study in which 30 
      newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with aggressive lymphoma will be 
      recruited over a 12-month period. Patients will complete comprehensive 
      assessments at three time points: baseline (time 1, pre-treatment) and two 
      post-baseline follow-up assessments (time 2, mid-treatment and time 3, 6-8 weeks 
      post-treatment completion). All patients will be assessed for self-reported 
      cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive function using Stroop Colour and 
      Word, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, 
      Controlled Oral Word Association and Digit Span. Blood cell-based inflammatory 
      markers and neuroimaging including a positron emission tomography (PET) with 
      (18)F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and CT ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) and a 
      MRI will explore potential inflammatory and neuroanatomical or functional 
      mechanisms and biomarkers related to CRCI. The primary intent of analysis will be 
      to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition using 
      subjective reports and objective tasks from patients during treatment and 
      recovery for lymphoma. These data will inform the design of a larger-scale 
      investigation into the patterns of cognitive change over the course of treatment 
      and recovery, adding to an underexplored area of cancer survivorship research.

      publications and conference presentations will report the findings of this novel 
      study. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since 
      December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and 
      depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly 
      explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an 
      immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's 
      immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary 
      inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the 
      worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable 
      immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible 
      screening actions and care that could be planned. METHOD: Data from previous 
      pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric 
      consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the 
      risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on 
      the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric 
      disorders on the other hand. RESULTS: As in previous pandemics, the activation of 
      the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during 
      pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for 
      the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in 
      individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the 
      risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. 
      CONCLUSION: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are 
      necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals 
      who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care 
      possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the 
      pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the 
      babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for 
      possible neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer patients have a highly increased risk of psychiatric disorders 
      following diagnosis, compared with cancer-free individuals. Inflammation is 
      involved in the development of both cancer and psychiatric disorders. The role of 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the subsequent risk of 
      psychiatric disorders after cancer diagnosis is however unknown. METHODS: We 
      performed a cohort study of all patients diagnosed with a first primary 
      malignancy between July 2006 and December 2013 in Sweden. Cox proportional 
      hazards models were used to assess the association of NSAID use during the year 
      before cancer diagnosis with the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related 
      disorders during the first year after cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 316,904 
      patients identified, 5613 patients received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, 
      or stress-related disorders during the year after cancer diagnosis. Compared with 
      no use of NSAIDs, the use of aspirin alone was associated with a lower rate of 
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 0.97), whereas the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs 
      alone was associated with a higher rate (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.32), after 
      adjustment for sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications for NSAID use, 
      and cancer characteristics. The association of aspirin with reduced rate of 
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders was strongest for current use 
      (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93), low-dose use (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), 
      long-term use (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.94), and among patients with 
      cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95) or breast cancer (HR, 
      0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: Pre-diagnostic use of aspirin was 
      associated with a decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related 
      disorders during the first year following cancer diagnosis.

TI  - Copeptin response to hypoglycemic stress is linked to prolactin activation in 
      children.
PG  - 681-690
LID - 10.1007/s11102-020-01076-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The physiological role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the acute stress 
      response in humans and especially in children is unclear. The aim of this study 
      was to explore the interaction between copeptin, a well-established surrogate 
      marker of AVP release, and anterior pituitary hormone activation in response to 
      acute hypoglycemic stress in children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted an 
      exploratory single center study involving 77 children and adolescents undergoing 
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Blood levels of copeptin, ACTH, cortisol, GH, 
      prolactin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined at 
      baseline and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Basal plasma levels of 
      copeptin (median: 5.2 pmol/L) increased significantly after hypoglycemia (median 
      9.7 pmol/L; P < 0.0001). Subjects with insufficient HPA axis response or severe 
      GH deficiency had lower hypoglycemia-induced copeptin increase (median: 
      2.3 pmol/L) compared with individuals with intact pituitary response (median: 
      5.2 pmol/L, P = 0.02). Copeptin increase correlated significantly with the 
      maximal increase of ACTH (r(s) = 0.30; P = 0.010), cortisol (r(s) = 0.33; 
      P = 0.003), prolactin (r(s) = 0.25; P = 0.03), IL-6 (r(s) = 0.35; P = 0.008) and 
      with BMI-SDS (r(s) = - 0.28, P = 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis, 
      prolactin increase was the only independent variable associated with copeptin 
      increase (P = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that: (1) hypoglycemic 
      stress elicits a marked copeptin response in children and adolescents, pointing 
      out its role as an acute stress marker in this population; (2) stress-induced 
      AVP/copeptin release is associated with anterior pituitary activation, mainly a 
      prolactin response.

TI  - Interactions between perceptions of fatigue, effort, and affect decrease knee 
      extensor endurance performance following upper body motor activity, independent 
      of changes in neuromuscular function.
PG  - e13602
LID - 10.1111/psyp.13602 [doi]
AB  - Prior exercise has previously been shown to impair subsequent endurance 
      performance in non-activated muscles. Declines in the neuromuscular function and 
      altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which 
      endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus 
      conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting 
      mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip 
      exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained, 
      sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment, 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function 
      of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the 
      first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions 
      of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor 
      endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance 
      performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding 
      handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance 
      performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened 
      effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the 
      second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the 
      neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study 
      indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise 
      in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional 
      interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function. 
      Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and 
      affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance.

TI  - Inflammation as a treatment target in mood disorders: review.
PG  - e60
LID - 10.1192/bjo.2020.43 [doi]
LID - e60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders, i.e. major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar 
      disorders, are leading sources of disability worldwide. Currently available 
      treatments do not yield remission in approximately a third of patients with a 
      mood disorder. This is in part because these treatments do not target a specific 
      core pathology underlying these heterogeneous disorders. In recent years, 
      abnormal inflammatory processes have been identified as putative 
      pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets in mood disorders, 
      particularly among individuals with treatment-resistant conditions. AIMS: In this 
      selective review, we aimed to summarise recent advances in the field of 
      immunopsychiatry, including emerging pathophysiological models and findings from 
      treatment ttrials of immunomodulatory agents for both MDD and bipolar disorders. 
      METHOD: We performed a literature review by searching Medline for clinical trials 
      of immunomodulating agents as monotherapy or adjunctive treatments in MDD and 
      bipolar disorders. Included studies are randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
      cluster RCTs or cross-over trials of immunomodulating agents that had an active 
      comparator or a placebo-arm. RESULTS: Current evidence shows an association 
      between inflammation and mood symptoms. However, there is conflicting evidence on 
      whether this link is causal. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should focus on 
      identifying specific neurobiological underpinnings for the putative causal 
      association between an activated inflammatory response and mood disorders. 
      Results of these studies are needed before further treatment trials of 
      immunomodulatory agents can be justified.

AB  - This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological 
      impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the 
      peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown 
      measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were 
      recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, 
      physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms 
      using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress 
      Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms 
      in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of 
      psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct 
      characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale 
      and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls 
      (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity 
      and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients 
      than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients 
      might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More 
      than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to 
      severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical 
      health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to 
      have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and 
      ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological 
      impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown 
      measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a 
      new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls 
      during the pandemic.

      Learning Analyses of Brain-Behavior Relationships.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the 
      Research Domain Criteria, an attempt to move beyond diagnostic categories and 
      ground psychiatry within neurobiological constructs that combine different levels 
      of measures (e.g., brain imaging and behavior). Statistical methods that can 
      integrate such multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting, 
      poor generalization, and difficulties in interpreting the results. METHODS: We 
      propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and 
      a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse 
      partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying 
      hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach, we 
      investigated structural brain-behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped 
      developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical 
      depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter 
      volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires 
      and IQ and demographic measures. RESULTS: Both sparse partial least squares and 
      kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of 
      brain-behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one 
      related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that 
      these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified 
      brain-behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the 
      literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain 
      volume. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate techniques (such as sparse partial least 
      squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis) embedded in our novel 
      framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or symptoms to neurobiology 
      and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition 
      of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression has been associated with increased inflammatory proteins, 
      but changes in circulating immune cells are less well defined. METHODS: We used 
      multiparametric flow cytometry to count 14 subsets of peripheral blood cells in 
      206 depression cases and 77 age- and sex-matched controls (N = 283). We used 
      univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the immunophenotypes 
      associated with depression and depression severity. RESULTS: Depression cases, 
      compared with controls, had significantly increased immune cell counts, 
      especially neutrophils, CD4(+) T cells, and monocytes, and increased inflammatory 
      proteins (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Within-group analysis of cases 
      demonstrated significant associations between the severity of depressive symptoms 
      and increased myeloid and CD4(+) T-cell counts. Depression cases were partitioned 
      into 2 subgroups by forced binary clustering of cell counts: the inflamed 
      depression subgroup (n = 81 out of 206; 39%) had increased monocyte, CD4(+), and 
      neutrophil counts; increased C-reactive protein and interleukin-6; and more 
      severe depression than the uninflamed majority of cases. Relaxing the presumption 
      of a binary classification, data-driven analysis identified 4 subgroups of 
      depression cases, 2 of which (n = 38 and n = 100; 67% collectively) were 
      associated with increased inflammatory proteins and more severe depression but 
      differed in terms of myeloid and lymphoid cell counts. Results were robust to 
      potentially confounding effects of age, sex, body mass index, recent infection, 
      and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral immune cell counts were used to 
      distinguish inflamed and uninflamed subgroups of depression and to indicate that 
      there may be mechanistically distinct subgroups of inflamed depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses confirm increased circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) 
      levels in depression. Longitudinal studies have linked one-off measurements of 
      CRP at baseline with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms 
      subsequently at follow-up, but studies with repeat CRP measures from the same 
      individuals are scarce. METHODS: We have examined whether longitudinal patterns 
      of inflammation, based on three CRP measurements from childhood to 
      early-adulthood, are associated with the risk of depression in early-adulthood in 
      the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort. 
      RESULTS: Using Gaussian mixture modelling of available CRP data from age 9, 15 
      and 18 years, we identified four population clusters/sub-groups reflecting 
      different longitudinal patterns of CRP: persistently low (N=463, 29.5%); 
      persistently high (N=371, 24%); decreasing (N=360, 23%); increasing (N=367, 
      23.5%). The increasing group showed a steep increase in CRP levels between 
      adolescence and early-adulthood. Participants in this group had a higher risk of 
      moderate/severe depression at age 18 years, compared with those with persistently 
      low CRP; adjusted odds ratio (OR)=3.78 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.46-9.81; 
      p=0.006). The odds of moderate/severe depression were also increased for the 
      persistently high CRP group, but this was not statistically significant; OR=2.54 
      (95% CI, 0.90-7.16). LIMITATIONS: Repeat CRP measures were available for a 
      subset, who may not be representative of all cohort participants. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results suggest that an increasing pattern of inflammation from adolescence 
      to early-adulthood is associated with risk of depression in early-adulthood.

TI  - Effects of immunomodulatory drugs on depressive symptoms: A mega-analysis of 
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in inflammatory disorders.
PG  - 1275-1285
LID - 10.1038/s41380-019-0471-8 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the innate immune system is commonly associated with depression. 
      Immunomodulatory drugs may have efficacy for depressive symptoms that are 
      co-morbidly associated with inflammatory disorders. We report a large-scale 
      re-analysis by standardized procedures (mega-analysis) of patient-level data 
      combined from 18 randomized clinical trials conducted by Janssen or 
      GlaxoSmithKline for one of nine disorders (N = 10,743 participants). Core 
      depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia) were measured by the Short Form Survey 
      (SF-36) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and participants 
      were stratified into high (N = 1921) versus low-depressive strata based on 
      baseline ratings. Placebo-controlled change from baseline after 4-16 weeks of 
      treatment was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) over all trials 
      and for each subgroup of trials targeting one of 7 mechanisms (IL-6, TNF-α, 
      IL-12/23, CD20, COX2, BLγS, p38/MAPK14). Patients in the high depressive stratum 
      showed modest but significant effects on core depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.29, 
      95% CI [0.12-0.45]) and related SF-36 measures of mental health and vitality. 
      Anti-IL-6 antibodies (SMD = 0.8, 95% CI [0.20-1.41]) and an anti-IL-12/23 
      antibody (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI [0.26-0.70]) had larger effects on depressive 
      symptoms than other drug classes. Adjustments for physical health outcome 
      marginally attenuated the average treatment effect on depressive symptoms 
      (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.35), but more strongly attenuated effects on mental 
      health and vitality. Effects of anti-IL-12/23 remained significant and anti-IL-6 
      antibodies became a trend after controlling for physical response to treatment. 
      Novel immune-therapeutics can produce antidepressant effects in depressed 
      patients with primary inflammatory disorders that are not entirely explained by 
      treatment-related changes in physical health.

AB  - Understanding how variations in dimensions of psychometrics, IQ and demographics 
      relate to changes in brain connectivity during the critical developmental period 
      of adolescence and early adulthood is a major challenge. This has particular 
      relevance for mental health disorders where a failure to understand these links 
      might hinder the development of better diagnostic approaches and therapeutics. 
      Here, we investigated this question in 306 adolescents and young adults (14-24 y, 
      25 clinically depressed) using a multivariate statistical framework, based on 
      canonical correlation analysis (CCA). By linking individual functional brain 
      connectivity profiles to self-report questionnaires, IQ and demographic data we 
      identified two distinct modes of covariation. The first mode mapped onto an 
      externalization/internalization axis and showed a strong association with sex. 
      The second mode mapped onto a well-being/distress axis independent of sex. 
      Interestingly, both modes showed an association with age. Crucially, the changes 
      in functional brain connectivity associated with changes in these phenotypes 
      showed marked developmental effects. The findings point to a role for the default 
      mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks in psychopathology and depression.

TI  - Prevalence of low-grade inflammation in depression: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of CRP levels.
PG  - 1958-1970
LID - 10.1017/S0033291719001454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral low-grade inflammation in depression is increasingly seen 
      as a therapeutic target. We aimed to establish the prevalence of low-grade 
      inflammation in depression, using different C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, 
      through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched 
      the PubMed database from its inception to July 2018, and selected studies that 
      assessed depression using a validated tool/scale, and allowed the calculation of 
      the proportion of patients with low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) or elevated 
      CRP (>1 mg/L). RESULTS: After quality assessment, 37 studies comprising 13 541 
      depressed patients and 155 728 controls were included. Based on the meta-analysis 
      of 30 studies, the prevalence of low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) in 
      depression was 27% (95% CI 21-34%); this prevalence was not associated with 
      sample source (inpatient, outpatient or population-based), antidepressant 
      treatment, participant age, BMI or ethnicity. Based on the meta-analysis of 17 
      studies of depression and matched healthy controls, the odds ratio for low-grade 
      inflammation in depression was 1.46 (95% CI 1.22-1.75). The prevalence of 
      elevated CRP (>1 mg/L) in depression was 58% (95% CI 47-69%), and the 
      meta-analytic odds ratio for elevated CRP in depression compared with controls 
      was 1.47 (95% CI 1.18-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of patients with 
      depression show evidence of low-grade inflammation, and over half of patients 
      show mildly elevated CRP levels. There are significant differences in the 
      prevalence of low-grade inflammation between patients and matched healthy 
      controls. These findings suggest that inflammation could be relevant to a large 
      number of patients with depression.

TI  - Compulsivity and impulsivity traits linked to attenuated developmental 
      frontostriatal myelination trajectories.
PG  - 992-999
LID - 10.1038/s41593-019-0394-3 [doi]
AB  - The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a period when ongoing brain 
      development coincides with a substantially increased risk of psychiatric 
      disorders. The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent 
      psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal 
      dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI 
      scans, we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide 
      growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical 
      white matter. In this healthy population, the expression of common developmental 
      traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these 
      MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in 
      dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral 
      and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that 
      psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally 
      specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain 
      development.

AB  - The discovery that prolonged administration of interferon-alpha (a 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine) readily precipitates depressive symptoms has played a 
      key role in development of the inflammation theory of major depressive disorder 
      (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients 
      with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with, or can be 
      distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we 
      explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients 
      undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition 
      to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The 
      resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6 
      previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al., 2004). This confirmatory 
      factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our 
      interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described 
      for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead, subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a 
      distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 15). The second 
      sleep disorder factor (items 4, 5, 6) replicated previous findings in 
      'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and 
      function (items 7, 12, 13, 14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in 
      idiopathic depression studies), grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss 
      (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3, 8, and 17) were excluded from 
      analysis due to very low variance. At transition, interferon-alpha induced major 
      depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features 
      that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low 
      likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this 
      clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression 
      etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized 
      therapies.

TI  - Cortical patterning of abnormal morphometric similarity in psychosis is

AB  - Schizophrenia has been conceived as a disorder of brain connectivity, but it is 
      unclear how this network phenotype is related to the underlying genetics. We used 
      morphometric similarity analysis of MRI data as a marker of interareal cortical 
      connectivity in three prior case-control studies of psychosis: in total, n = 185 
      cases and n = 227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced 
      morphometric similarity in all three studies. There was also a replicable pattern 
      of case-control differences in regional morphometric similarity, which was 
      significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas but 
      increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data, we 
      found that the cortical map of case-control differences in morphometric 
      similarity was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted 
      combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms and 
      pathways. In addition, genes that were normally overexpressed in cortical areas 
      with reduced morphometric similarity were significantly up-regulated in three 
      prior post mortem studies of schizophrenia. We propose that this combined 
      analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides insight into how 
      previously implicated genes and proteins as well as a number of unreported genes 
      in their topological vicinity on the protein interaction network may drive 
      structural brain network changes mediating the genetic risk of schizophrenia.

AB  - A mechanistic understanding of the pathology of psychiatric disorders has been 
      hampered by extensive heterogeneity in biology, symptoms, and behavior within 
      diagnostic categories that are defined subjectively. We investigated whether 
      leveraging individual differences in information-processing impairments in 
      patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could reveal phenotypes 
      within the disorder. We found that a subgroup of patients with PTSD from two 
      independent cohorts displayed both aberrant functional connectivity within the 
      ventral attention network (VAN) as revealed by functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging and impaired verbal memory on a word list learning 
      task. This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or 
      comorbidities, but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to 
      psychotherapy, the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal 
      noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we then 
      identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by 
      direct stimulation of that network. These alterations were associated with 
      individual differences in functional fMRI connectivity within the VAN. Our 
      findings define specific neurobiological mechanisms in a subgroup of patients 
      with PTSD that could contribute to the poor response to psychotherapy.

TI  - Inflammation and Depression: A Nervous Plea for Psychiatry to Not Become Immune 
      to Interpretation.
LID - 10.3390/ph12010029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - The possibility that inflammation plays a causal role in major depression is an 
      important claim in the emerging field of immunopsychiatry and has generated hope 
      for new treatments. The aims of the present review are first to provide some 
      historical background and to consider the evidence in favor of the claim that 
      inflammation is causally involved in major depression. The second part discusses 
      some of the possibilities allowed for by the use of broad 'umbrella' concepts, 
      such as inflammation and stress, in terms of proposing new working hypotheses and 
      potential mechanisms. The third part reviews proposed biomarkers of inflammation 
      and depression and the final part addresses how elements discussed in the 
      preceding sections are used in immunopsychiatry. The 'umbrella' concepts of 
      inflammation and stress, as well as insufficiently-met criteria based inferences 
      and reverse inferences are being used to some extent in immunopsychiatry. The 
      field is therefore encouraged to specify concepts and constructs, as well as to 
      consider potential alternative interpretations and explanations for findings 
      obtained. The hope is that pointing out some of the potential problems will allow 
      for a clearer picture of immunopsychiatry's current strengths and limitations and 
      help the field mature.

TI  - Change, stability, and instability in the Pavlovian guidance of behaviour from 
      adolescence to young adulthood.
PG  - e1006679

AB  - Pavlovian influences are important in guiding decision-making across health and 
      psychopathology. There is an increasing interest in using concise computational 
      tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations, and especially to 
      track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However, 
      the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain, a problem 
      compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements. 
      We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well 
      characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of 
      Pavlovian influences and other 'psychomarkers' guiding decision-making would 
      behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as 
      precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task, we expected this 
      influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally, we hypothesized it 
      would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian 
      effects had weak temporal stability, while model-fit was more stable. In terms of 
      external validity, Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience 
      within the task, in line with normative expectations. However, Pavlovian effects 
      were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus, although this 
      computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development, it 
      does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We 
      suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived

      depression in a prospective birth cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-grade inflammation is associated with depression, but studies of 
      specific symptoms are relatively scarce. Association between inflammatory markers 
      and specific symptoms may provide insights into potential mechanism of 
      inflammation-related depression. Using longitudinal data, we have tested whether 
      childhood serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are 
      associated with specific depressive symptoms in early adulthood. METHODS: In the 
      ALSPAC birth cohort, serum IL-6 and CRP levels were assessed at age 9 years and 
      19 depressive symptoms were assessed at age 18 years. We used modified Poisson 
      generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk 
      ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each depressive symptom. In 
      addition, we used confirmatory factor analysis to create two continuous latent 
      variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension 
      scores. Structural equation modelling was used to test the associations between 
      IL-6 and these dimension scores. RESULTS: Based on data from 2731 participants, 
      IL-6 was associated with diurnal mood variation, concentration difficulties, 
      fatigue and sleep disturbances. The adjusted RRs for these symptoms at age 
      18 years for participants in top, compared with bottom, third of IL-6 at age 
      9 years were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.13-2.69) for diurnal mood variation, 1.50 (95% CI, 
      1.11-2.02) for concentration difficulties, 1.31 (95% CI, 1.12-1.54) for fatigue, 
      and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.01-1.52) for sleep disturbances. At dimension level, IL-6 was 
      associated with both somatic/neurovegetative (β = 0.059, SE = 0.024, P = 0.013) 
      and psychological (β = 0.056, SE = 0.023, P = 0.016) scores. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Inflammation is associated with specific symptoms of depression. Associations 
      with so-called somatic/neurovegetative symptoms of depression such as fatigue, 
      sleep disturbances and diurnal mood variation indicate that these symptoms could 
      be useful treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials 
      of anti-inflammatory treatment for depression.

TI  - Trajectories and Milestones of Cortical and Subcortical Development of the 
      Marmoset Brain From Infancy to Adulthood.
PG  - 4440-4453
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhy256 [doi]
AB  - With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and 
      assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it 
      has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of 
      birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
      (n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
      model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical 
      areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, 
      peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter 
      development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
      age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth 
      trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association 
      cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. 
      Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most 
      heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones 
      and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of 
      high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and 
      importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
      to environmental impact.

TI  - Sex-specific impact of prenatal androgens on social brain default mode 
      subsystems.
PG  - 2175-2188
LID - 10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y [doi]
AB  - Early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism) affect males more 
      frequently than females. Androgens may play a role in this male-bias by 
      sex-differentially impacting early prenatal brain development, particularly 
      neural circuits that later develop specialized roles in social cognition. Here, 
      we find that increasing prenatal testosterone in humans is associated with later 
      reduction of functional connectivity between social brain default mode (DMN) 
      subsystems in adolescent males, but has no effect in females. Since testosterone 
      can work directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen 
      receptor through aromatase conversion to estradiol, we further examined how a 
      potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), acts via the AR to 
      influence gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC)-particularly for 
      genes of high-relevance for DMN circuitry. DHT dysregulates a number of genes 
      enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and for genes 
      that in later development are expressed in anatomical patterns that highly 
      correspond to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. DMN-related and DHT-affected 
      genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes, many of which 
      impact excitation-inhibition balance. Androgens have male-specific prenatal 
      influence over social brain circuitry in humans and may be relevant towards 
      explaining some component of male-bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental 
      conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: The reports regarding the status of the immune system in patients with 
      chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have been inconclusive. 
      We approached this question by comparing a strictly defined group of CFS/ME 
      outpatients to healthy control individuals, and thereafter studied cytokines in 
      subgroups with various psychiatric symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 
      patients diagnosed with CFS/ME according to the Fukuda criteria and 20 age- and 
      sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Plasma was analysed by 
      ELISA for levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10. Participants also 
      answered questionnaires regarding health in general, and psychiatric symptoms in 
      detail. RESULTS: Increased plasma levels of TNF-α in CFS/ME patients almost 
      reached significance compared to healthy controls (p = .056). When studying the 
      CFS/ME and control groups separately, there was a significant correlation between 
      TNF-α and The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depressive symptoms in 
      controls only, not in the CFS/ME group. A correlation between IL-10 and 
      psychoticism was found in both groups, whereas the correlation for somatisation 
      was seen only in the CFS/ME group. When looking at the total population, there 
      was a significant correlation between TNF-α and both the HADS depressive symptoms 
      and the SCL-90-R cluster somatisation. Also, there was a significant association 
      between IL-10 and the SCL-90-R cluster somatisation when analyzing the cohort 
      (patients and controls together). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that 
      immune activity in CFS/ME patients deviates from that of healthy controls, which 
      implies potential pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches to 
      CFS/ME. More comprehensive studies should be carried out on defined CFS/ME 
      subgroups.

AB  - This meta-analytic review evaluated the effectiveness of depression interventions 
      on the psychological and immunological outcomes of people living with HIV in 
      sub-Saharan Africa. 14 studies, yielding 932 participants were eligible. A 
      random-effects models indicated that depression interventions were followed by 
      large reductions in depression scores (effect size = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.71, 2.01, 
      p < 0.01). No significant effect on immune outcome was observed, however there 
      was a trend toward immune improvement of medium effect size (effect size on CD4 
      count and/or viral suppression = 0.57, 95% CI = -0.06, 1.20, p = 0.08). 
      Pharmacological interventions appeared to have a significantly larger improvement 
      in depression scores than psychological interventions. The greatest improvement 
      in immune status was demonstrated in psychological treatments which incorporated 
      a component to enhance HIV medication adherence, however these results did not 
      reach significance. Small sample sizes and highly heterogeneous analysis 
      necessitate caution in interpretation. The results of this meta-analysis should 
      thus be treated as preliminary evidence and used to encourage further studies of 
      immunopsychiatry in HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of acute hypoglycemia on markers of inflammation have 
      been investigated, but the results have been heterogeneous. OBJECTIVE: We aimed 
      to perform a systematic review about the acute effects of insulin-induced 
      hypoglycemia on inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes as well as 
      non-diabetic subjects. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature using the 
      electronic databases MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted through September 2017. 
      Search terms included: "hypoglycemia"," insulin", "cytokines", and 
      "inflammation". We included original studies assessing peripheral inflammatory 
      markers during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      twenty-two citations were initially retrieved. Eleven studies were included in 
      our systematic review. Acute hypoglycemia increases total leukocyte number and 
      several pro-inflammatory markers. Elevation in pro-inflammatory markers in 
      response to insulin-induced acute hypoglycemia appears to be of similar magnitude 
      in non-diabetic subjects and in type-1 diabetic patients with intact awareness of 
      hypoglycemia. Adrenaline rises in response to acute hypoglycemia correlates with 
      the increase of pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Acute hypoglycemia induces 
      a pro-inflammatory state in both type-1 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with 
      no apparent significant difference between these two populations. Activation of 
      the sympathetic nervous system is a likely mediator of these effects.

AB  - The link between systemic autoimmunity, brain pathology, and aberrant behavior is 
      still a largely unexplored field of biomedical science. Accumulating evidence 
      points to causal relationships between immune factors, neurodegeneration, and 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations. By documenting autoimmunity-associated neuronal 
      degeneration and cytotoxicity of the cerebrospinal fluid from disease-affected 
      subjects, the murine MRL model had shown high validity in revealing principal 
      pathogenic circuits. In addition, unlike any other autoimmune strain, MRL mice 
      produce antibodies commonly found in patients suffering from lupus and other 
      autoimmune disorders. This review highlights importance of the MRL model as a 
      useful preparation in understanding the links between immune system and brain 
      function.

AB  - Human brain networks based on neuroimaging data have already proven useful in 
      characterizing both normal and abnormal brain structure and function. However, 
      many brain disorders are neurodevelopmental in origin, highlighting the need to 
      go beyond characterizing brain organization in terms of static networks. Here, we 
      review the fast-growing literature shedding light on developmental changes in 
      network phenotypes. We begin with an overview of recent large-scale efforts to 
      map healthy brain development, and we describe the key role played by 
      longitudinal data including repeated measurements over a long period of 
      follow-up. We also discuss the subtle ways in which healthy brain network 
      development can inform our understanding of disorders, including work bridging 
      the gap between macroscopic neuroimaging results and the microscopic level. 
      Finally, we turn to studies of three specific neurodevelopmental disorders that 
      first manifest primarily in childhood and adolescence/early adulthood, namely

TI  - Systemic inflammation and intelligence in early adulthood and subsequent risk of 
      schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses: a longitudinal cohort and 
      co-relative study.
PG  - 295-302
LID - 10.1017/S0033291718000831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with impaired neurodevelopment as indexed 
      by lower premorbid IQ. We examined associations between erythrocyte sedimentation 
      rate (ESR), a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation, IQ, and subsequent 
      schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (ONAP) to elucidate the role of 
      neurodevelopment and inflammation in the pathogenesis of psychosis. METHODS: 
      Population-based data on ESR and IQ from 638 213 Swedish men assessed during 
      military conscription between 1969 and 1983 were linked to National Hospital 
      Discharge Register for hospitalisation with schizophrenia and ONAP. The 
      associations of ESR with IQ (cross-sectional) and psychoses (longitudinal) were 
      investigated using linear and Cox-regression. The co-relative analysis was used 
      to examine effects of shared familial confounding. We examined mediation and 
      moderation of effect between ESR and IQ on psychosis risk. RESULTS: Baseline IQ 
      was associated with subsequent risk of schizophrenia (adjusted HR per 1-point 
      increase in IQ = 0.961; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960-0.963) and ONAP 
      (adjusted HR = 0.973; 95% CI 0.971-0.975). Higher ESR was associated with lower 
      IQ in a dose-response fashion. High ESR was associated with increased risk for 
      schizophrenia (adjusted HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28) and decreased risk for ONAP 
      (adjusted HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.96), although these effects were specific to 
      one ESR band (7-10 mm/hr). Familial confounding explained ESR-IQ but not 
      ESR-psychoses associations. IQ partly mediated the ESR-psychosis relationships. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lower IQ is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and with 
      an increased risk of schizophrenia and ONAP in adulthood. Low-grade inflammation 
      may influence schizophrenia risk by affecting neurodevelopment. Future studies 
      should explore the differential effects of inflammation on different types of 
      psychosis.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of neural and immune disorders, their etiology and 
      molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. As the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is 
      increasingly utilized as a powerful model organism in biomedical research, 
      mounting evidence suggests these fish as a useful tool to study neural and immune 
      mechanisms and their interplay. Here, we discuss zebrafish neuro-immune 
      mechanisms and their pharmacological and genetic modulation, the effect of stress 
      on cytokines, as well as relevant models of microbiota-brain interplay. As many 
      human brain diseases are based on complex interplay between the neural and the 
      immune system, here we discuss zebrafish models, as well as recent successes and 
      challenges, in this rapidly expanding field. We particularly emphasize the 
      growing utility of zebrafish models in translational immunopsychiatry research, 
      as they improve our understanding of pathogenetic neuro-immune interactions, 
      thereby fostering future discovery of potential therapeutic agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence supports a role for immune alterations in 
      Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD). A high prevalence (25-40%) of SSD has 
      been found in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), which is known 
      for T-cell deficits due to thymus hypoplasia. This study is the first to explore 
      the association between the T-cell subsets and psychotic symptoms in adults with 
      22q11.2DS. METHODS: 34 individuals (aged 19-38 yrs.) with 22q11.2DS and 34 
      healthy age- and gender matched control individuals were included. FACS analysis 
      of the blood samples was performed to define T-cell subsets. Ultra-high risk for 
      psychosis or diagnosis of SSD was determined based on CAARMS interviews and DSM-5 
      criteria for SSD. Positive psychotic symptom severity was measured based on the 
      PANSS positive symptoms subscale. RESULTS: A partial T-cell immune deficiency in 
      22q11.2DS patients was confirmed by significantly reduced percentages of 
      circulating T and T-helper cells. Significantly higher percentages of 
      inflammatory Th1, Th17, and memory T-helper cells were found in adults with 
      22q11.2DS. Most importantly an increased Th17 percentage was found in adults with 
      psychotic symptoms as compared to non-psychotic adults with 22q11.2DS, and Th17 
      percentage were related to the presence of positive psychotic symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the literature on the role of T cells and in particular of 
      Th17 cells and IL-17 in hippocampus development, cognition and behavior, these 
      results support the hypothesis for a role of Th17 cells in the development and/or 
      regulation of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS. This pilot study underlines the 
      importance to further study the role of T-cell defects and of Th17 cells in the 
      development of psychiatric symptoms. It also supports the possibility to use 
      22q11.2DS as a model to study T-cell involvement in the development of SSD.

AB  - Low-grade inflammation is a risk factor for depression, psychosis and other major 
      psychiatric disorders. It is associated with poor response to antidepressant and 
      antipsychotics, and could potentially be a treatment target. However, there is 
      limited data on the prevalence of low-grade inflammation in major psychiatric 
      disorders, and on the characteristics of patients who show evidence of 
      inflammation. We examined the prevalence of low-grade inflammation and associated 
      socio-demographic and clinical factors in acute psychiatric inpatients. An 
      anonymised search of the electronic patient records of Cambridgeshire and 
      Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust was used to identify patients aged 18-65 years 
      who were hospitalised between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive). We excluded patients on 
      antibiotics or oral steroids, or with missing data. Inflammation was defined 
      using serum C-reactive protein (>3 mg/L) or total white cell count 
      (>9.4 × 10(9)/L) as measured within 14 days of admission. Out of all 599 
      admissions, the prevalence of inflammation (serum CRP >3 mg/L) in the ICD-10 
      diagnostic groups of psychotic disorders (F20-29), mood disorders (F30-39), 
      neurotic disorders (F40-48) and personality disorders (F60-69) was 32%, 21%, 22% 
      and 42%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, low-grade inflammation was 
      associated with older age, black ethnicity, being single, self-harm, diagnoses of 
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, current treatments with antidepressants, 
      benzodiazepines, and with current treatment for medical comorbidities. A notable 
      proportion of acutely unwell psychiatric patients from all ICD-10 major 
      diagnostic groups show evidence of low-grade inflammation, suggesting 
      inflammation may be relevant for all psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Synaptic and transcriptionally downregulated genes are associated with cortical 
      thickness differences in autism.
PG  - 1053-1064

AB  - Differences in cortical morphology-in particular, cortical volume, thickness and 
      surface area-have been reported in individuals with autism. However, it is 
      unclear what aspects of genetic and transcriptomic variation are associated with 
      these differences. Here we investigate the genetic correlates of global cortical 
      thickness differences (ΔCT) in children with autism. We used Partial Least 
      Squares Regression (PLSR) on structural MRI data from 548 children (166 with 
      autism, 295 neurotypical children and 87 children with ADHD) and cortical gene 
      expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science to identify genetic 
      correlates of ΔCT in autism. We identify that these genes are enriched for 
      synaptic transmission pathways and explain significant variation in ΔCT. These 
      genes are also significantly enriched for genes dysregulated in the autism 
      post-mortem cortex (Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.11, P(corrected)  10(-14)), driven 
      entirely by downregulated genes (OR = 1.87, P(corrected)  10(-15)). We validated 
      the enrichment for downregulated genes in two independent data sets: Validation 1 
      (OR = 1.44, P(corrected) = 0.004) and Validation 2 (OR = 1.30; 
      P(corrected) = 0.001). We conclude that transcriptionally downregulated genes 
      implicated in autism are robustly associated with global changes in cortical 
      thickness variability in children with autism.

TI  - Effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on the expression of tryptophan-metabolism 
      genes by human macrophages.
PG  - 681-692
LID - 10.1002/JLB.3A0617-261R [doi]
AB  - Several lines of evidence link macrophage activation and inflammation with 
      (monoaminergic) nervous systems in the etiology of depression. IFN treatment is 
      associated with depressive symptoms, whereas anti-TNFα therapies elicit positive 
      mood. This study describes the actions of 2 monoaminergic antidepressants 
      (escitalopram, nortriptyline) and 3 anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, 
      prednisolone, and anti-TNFα antibody) on the response of human monocyte-derived 
      macrophages (MDMs) from 6 individuals to LPS or IFN-α. Expression profiling 
      revealed robust changes in the MDM transcriptome (3294 genes at P < 0.001) 
      following LPS challenge, whereas a more limited subset of genes (499) responded 
      to IFNα. Contrary to published reports, administered at nontoxic doses, neither 
      monoaminergic antidepressant significantly modulated the transcriptional response 
      to either inflammatory challenge. Each anti-inflammatory drug had a distinct 
      impact on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and on the profile of 
      inducible gene expression-notably on the regulation of enzymes involved in 
      metabolism of tryptophan. Inter alia, the effect of anti-TNFα antibody confirmed 
      a predicted autocrine stimulatory loop in human macrophages. The transcriptional 
      changes were predictive of tryptophan availability and kynurenine synthesis, as 
      analyzed by targeted metabolomic studies on cellular supernatants. We suggest 
      that inflammatory processes in the brain or periphery could impact on depression 
      by altering the availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis and/or by 
      increasing production of neurotoxic kynurenine.

AB  - Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central 
      scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is 
      based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of 
      influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change 
      score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease 
      apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and 
      behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that 
      naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can 
      even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement 
      occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a 
      lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N = 204 (N = 32 imaging) on two waves) 
      we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a 
      high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, 
      N = 176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males 
      than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental 
      community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and 
      basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and Ωnyx).

TI  - Probabilistic thresholding of functional connectomes: Application to 
      schizophrenia.

AB  - Functional connectomes are commonly analysed as sparse graphs, constructed by 
      thresholding cross-correlations between regional neurophysiological signals. 
      Thresholding generally retains the strongest edges (correlations), either by 
      retaining edges surpassing a given absolute weight, or by constraining the edge 
      density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive 
      edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge 
      densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods, which enable construction of 
      probabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type I error, to a dataset of 
      resting-state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy 
      controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value, we found 
      that functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more dysconnected 
      than those of healthy controls, exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher 
      number of (dis)connected components. Furthermore, many participants' connectomes 
      could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the 
      literature (∼5-30%), while controlling for type I error. Additionally, we showed 
      that the topological randomisation previously reported in the schizophrenia 
      literature is likely attributable to "non-significant" edges added when 
      thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation. Finally, by 
      explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value and decreasing 
      correlation, we showed that probabilistically thresholded connectomes show

AB  - Macroscopic cortical networks are important for cognitive function, but it 
      remains challenging to construct anatomically plausible individual structural 
      connectomes from human neuroimaging. We introduce a new technique for cortical 
      network mapping based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric 
      parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one 
      macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have 
      a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human 
      MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater 
      inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger 
      inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing 
      macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was 
      related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN 
      nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric 
      similarity mapping provides a novel, robust, and biologically plausible approach 
      to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in 
      psychological functions.

AB  - Complex network topology is characteristic of many biological systems, including 
      anatomical and functional brain networks (connectomes). Here, we first 
      constructed a structural covariance network from MRI measures of cortical 
      thickness on 296 healthy volunteers, aged 14-24 years. Next, we designed a new 
      algorithm for matching sample locations from the Allen Brain Atlas to the nodes 
      of the SCN. Subsequently we used this to define, transcriptomic brain networks by 
      estimating gene co-expression between pairs of cortical regions. Finally, we 
      explored the hypothesis that transcriptional networks and structural MRI 
      connectomes are coupled. A transcriptional brain network (TBN) and a structural 
      covariance network (SCN) were correlated across connection weights and showed 
      qualitatively similar complex topological properties: assortativity, 
      small-worldness, modularity, and a rich-club. In both networks, the weight of an 
      edge was inversely related to the anatomical (Euclidean) distance between 
      regions. There were differences between networks in degree and distance 
      distributions: the transcriptional network had a less fat-tailed degree 
      distribution and a less positively skewed distance distribution than the SCN. 
      However, cortical areas connected to each other within modules of the SCN had 
      significantly higher levels of whole genome co-expression than expected by 
      chance. Nodes connected in the SCN had especially high levels of expression and 
      co-expression of a human supragranular enriched (HSE) gene set that has been 
      specifically located to supragranular layers of human cerebral cortex and is 
      known to be important for large-scale, long-distance cortico-cortical 
      connectivity. This coupling of brain transcriptome and connectome topologies was 
      largely but not entirely accounted for by the common constraint of physical 
      distance on both networks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels are commonly elevated in patients with 
      depression and psychosis and in people who are at risk of developing these 
      disorders. A common, functional variant in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala; 
      rs2228145 A > C) is known to dampen down inflammation by impairing IL6R 
      signaling. We have examined the association of Asp358Ala with diagnosis of 
      depression and psychosis, serum IL-6, CRP levels, and a number of risk factors 
      commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis. We predicted that if 
      IL-6 were related to depression/psychosis risk causally, rather than due to 
      confounding, Asp358Ala would be associated with risk of these disorders, serum 
      IL-6, CRP levels, but not with any of the confounders. METHOD: We used data from 
      the population-based ALSPAC birth cohort. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were measured 
      at age 9 years. Psychotic disorder, ICD-10 diagnosis of severe depressive 
      episode, and total depression score were assessed at age 18 years. IL6R Asp358Ala 
      was genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping 
      platform. Risk factors assessed include sex, body mass index, social class, 
      ethnicity, maternal education, birth weight, gestational age, maternal post-natal 
      depression, childhood psychological and behavioral problems, and total IQ score. 
      RESULTS: Asp358Ala was associated with decreased risk of severe depression and/or 
      psychosis; adjusted odds ratio for those with CC, compared with AA, genotype was 
      0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.94). The variant was associated with increased serum IL-6 
      levels (P = 5.5 × 10(-22)) but decreased serum CRP levels (P = 3.5 × 10(-5)), 
      consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect downstream of IL-6. Asp358Ala was not 
      associated with total depression score. Asp358Ala was not associated with any of 
      the other risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis 
      (all P > 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide further evidence that the 
      IL-6/IL6R pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and 
      psychosis, and may be novel therapeutic targets. Previously reported associations 
      between IL-6, depression and psychosis are unlikely to be fully explained by 
      confounding. Based on a small number of cases, findings from the current study 
      need replication in other samples.

TI  - Childhood inflammatory markers and intelligence as predictors of subsequent 
      persistent depressive symptoms: a longitudinal cohort study.
PG  - 1514-1522
LID - 10.1017/S0033291717003038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms during 
      the second decade of life, a critical period of brain development, using data 
      from a prospective birth cohort. To test whether childhood intelligence and 
      inflammatory markers are associated with subsequent persistent depressive 
      symptoms. METHODS: IQ, a proxy for neurodevelopment, was measured at age 8 years. 
      Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, typical inflammatory markers, were 
      measured at age 9 years. Depressive symptoms were measured six times between 10 
      and 19 years using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ), which were 
      coded as binary variable and then used in latent class analysis to identify 
      developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Longitudinal SMFQ data 
      from 9156 participants yielded three distinct population sub-groups of depressive 
      symptoms: no symptoms (81.2%); adolescent-onset symptoms (13.2%); persistent 
      symptoms (5.6%). Lower IQ and higher IL-6 levels in childhood were independently 
      associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms in a linear, 
      dose-response fashion, but not with adolescent-onset symptoms. Compared with the 
      group with no symptoms the adjusted odds ratio for persistent depressive symptoms 
      per s.d. increase in IQ was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95); that for IL-6 was 1.20 (95% 
      CI, 1.03-1.39). Evidence for an association with IL-6 remained after controlling 
      for initial severity of depressive symptoms at 10 years. There was no evidence 
      that IL-6 moderated or mediated the IQ-persistent depressive symptom 
      relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate potentially important roles for 
      two distinct biological processes, neurodevelopment and inflammation, in the 
      aetiology of persistent depressive symptoms in young people.

AB  - The blood-brain interface (BBI) is the subject of a new named series at Brain, 
      Behavior, and Immunity. It is timely to reflect on a number of advances in the 
      field within the last ten years, which may lead to an increased understanding of 
      human behaviour and a wide range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. We 
      cover discoveries made in solute and cell trafficking, endothelial cell and 
      pericyte biology, extracellular matrix and emerging tools, especially those which 
      will enable study of the human BBI. We now recognize the central role of the BBI 
      in a number of immunopsychiatric syndromes, including sickness behaviour, 
      delirium, septic encephalopathy, cognitive side effects of cytokine-based 
      therapies and the frank psychosis observed in neuronal surface antibody 
      syndromes. In addition, we find ourselves interrogating and modulating the brain 
      across the BBI, during diagnostic investigation and treatment of brain disease. 
      The past ten years of BBI research have been exciting but there is more to come.

TI  - Interferon-Alpha Reduces Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Increases Apoptosis 
      via Activation of Distinct STAT1-Dependent Mechanisms.
PG  - 187-200
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyx083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, interferon-α treatment for chronic viral hepatitis is a 
      well-recognized clinical model for inflammation-induced depression, but the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. Following peripheral 
      administration in rodents, interferon-α induces signal transducer and activator 
      of transcription-1 (STAT1) within the hippocampus and disrupts hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. METHODS: We used the human hippocampal progenitor cell line 
      HPC0A07/03C to evaluate the effects of 2 concentrations of interferon-α, similar 
      to those observed in human serum during its therapeutic use (500 pg/mL and 5000 
      pg/mL), on neurogenesis and apoptosis. RESULTS: Both concentrations of 
      interferon-α decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, with the high concentration also 
      increasing apoptosis. Moreover, interferon-α increased the expression of 
      interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), 
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) via activation of STAT1. Like interferon-α, co-treatment 
      with a combination of ISG15, USP18, and IL-6 was able to reduce neurogenesis and 
      enhance apoptosis via further downstream activation of STAT1. Further experiments 
      showed that ISG15 and USP18 mediated the interferon-α-induced reduction in 
      neurogenesis (potentially through upregulation of the ISGylation-related proteins 
      UBA7, UBE2L6, and HERC5), while IL-6 mediated the interferon-α-induced increase 
      in apoptosis (potentially through downregulation of aquaporin 4). Using 
      transcriptomic analyses, we showed that interferon-α regulated pathways involved 
      in oxidative stress and immune response (e.g., Nuclear Factor (erythroid-derived 
      2)-like 2 [Nrf2] and interferon regulatory factor [IRF] signaling pathway), 
      neuronal formation (e.g., CAMP response element-binding protein [CREB] 
      signaling), and cell death regulation (e.g., tumor protein(p)53 signaling). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We identify novel molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of 
      interferon-α on the human hippocampus potentially involved in 
      inflammation-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms.

LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.155 [doi]
AB  - Evidence on systemic inflammation as a risk factor for future depression is 
      inconsistent, possibly due to a lack of regard for persistency of exposure. We 
      examined whether being inflamed on multiple occasions increases risk of new 
      depressive symptoms using prospective data from a population-based sample of 
      adults aged 50 years or older (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). 
      Participants with less than four of eight depressive symptoms in 2004/05 and 
      2008/09 based on the Eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale 
      were analysed. The number of occasions with C-reactive protein ⩾3 mg l(-1) over 
      the same initial assessments (1 vs 0 occasion, and 2 vs 0 occasions) was examined 
      in relation to change in depressive symptoms between 2008/09 and 2012/13 and odds 
      of developing depressive symptomology (having more than or equal to four of eight 
      symptoms) in 2012/13. In multivariable-adjusted regression models (n=2068), 
      participants who were inflamed on 1 vs 0 occasion showed no increase in 
      depressive symptoms nor raised odds of developing depressive symptomology; those 
      inflamed on 2 vs 0 occasions showed a 0.10 (95% confidence intervals (CIs)=-0.07, 
      0.28) symptom increase and 1.60 (95% CI=1.00, 2.55) times higher odds. In further 
      analyses, 2 vs 0 occasions of inflammation were associated with increased odds of 
      developing depressive symptoms among women (odds ratio (OR)=2.75, 95% CI=1.53, 
      4.95), but not among men (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.29, 1.68); P-for-sex 
      interaction=0.035. In this cohort study of older adults, repeated but not 
      transient exposure to systemic inflammation was associated with increased risk of 
      future depressive symptoms among women; this subgroup finding requires 
      confirmation of validity.

TI  - Mutualistic Coupling Between Vocabulary and Reasoning Supports Cognitive 
      Development During Late Adolescence and Early Adulthood.
PG  - 1419-1431
LID - 10.1177/0956797617710785 [doi]
AB  - One of the most replicable findings in psychology is the positive manifold: the 
      observation that individual differences in cognitive abilities are universally 
      positively correlated. Investigating the developmental origin of the positive 
      manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of 
      adolescents and young adults ( N = 785; n = 566 across two waves, mean interval 
      between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14-25 years), we examined developmental 
      changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used 
      bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of 
      cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We 
      showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities 
      directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of 
      developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary 
      showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling 
      pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic 
      window into cognitive development.

TI  - Replicable and Coupled Changes in Innate and Adaptive Immune Gene Expression in 
      Two Case-Control Studies of Blood Microarrays in Major Depressive Disorder.

LID - S0006-3223(17)31617-7 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral inflammation is often associated with major depressive 
      disorder (MDD), and immunological biomarkers of depression remain a focus of 
      investigation. METHODS: We used microarray data on whole blood from two 
      independent case-control studies of MDD: the GlaxoSmithKline-High-Throughput 
      Disease-specific target Identification Program [GSK-HiTDiP] study (113 patients 
      and 57 healthy control subjects) and the Janssen-Brain Resource Company study (94 
      patients and 100 control subjects). Genome-wide differential gene expression 
      analysis (18,863 probes) resulted in a p value for each gene in each study. A 
      Bayesian method identified the largest p-value threshold (q = .025) associated 
      with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared 
      with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance. 
      RESULTS: A total of 165 genes were differentially expressed in both studies with 
      concordant direction of fold change. The 90 genes overexpressed (or UP genes) in 
      MDD were significantly enriched for immune response to infection, were 
      concentrated in a module of the gene coexpression network associated with innate 
      immunity, and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in monocytes, 
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In contrast, the 75 genes 
      underexpressed (or DOWN genes) in MDD were associated with the adaptive immune 
      response and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in T cells, 
      natural killer cells, and erythroblasts. Consistently, the MDD patients with 
      overexpression of UP genes also had underexpression of DOWN genes (correlation > 
      .70 in both studies). CONCLUSIONS: MDD was replicably associated with 
      proinflammatory activation of the peripheral innate immune system, coupled with 
      relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system, indicating the potential of 
      transcriptional biomarkers for immunological stratification of patients with 
      depression.

AB  - Studies over the last 20 years have demonstrated that increased inflammation and 
      hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are two of the 
      most consistent biological findings in major depression and are often associated: 
      but the molecular and clinical mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are 
      still unclear. These findings are particularly enigmatic, especially considering 
      the accepted notion that high levels of cortisol have an anti-inflammatory 
      action, and therefore the coexistence of inflammation and hypercortisolemia in 
      the same diagnostic group appears counter-intuitive. To celebrate the 2015 
      Anna-Monika Foundation Award to our laboratory, this review will discuss our own 
      20 years of research on the clinical and molecular evidence underlying the 
      increased inflammation in depression, especially in the context of a hyperactive 
      HPA axis, and discuss its implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of this 
      disorder.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicate a role for the immune system particularly 
      inflammation and autoimmunity in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders 
      such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we discuss some of the key 
      advances in immunopsychiatry in order to highlight to psychiatrists and other 
      health professionals how an increased understanding of this field might enhance 
      our knowledge of illness mechanism and approaches to treatment. We present a 
      brief overview of clinical research that link inflammation and autoimmunity with 
      depression and psychosis, including potential role of inflammation in treatment 
      response, current evidence for the effectiveness of immune-modulating treatment 
      for depression and psychosis, and possible role of inflammation in common 
      physical comorbidities for these disorders such as coronary heart disease and 
      diabetes mellitus. Gaining a better understanding of the role of immune system 
      could be paradigm changing for psychiatry. We need collaborations between 
      clinicians and scientists to deliver high-quality translational research in order 
      to fully realise the clinical potential of this exciting and rapidly expanding 
      field.

AB  - Defining the organizational principles of neuronal networks at the cellular 
      scale, or micro-connectomics, is a key challenge of modern neuroscience. In this 
      Review, we focus on graph theoretical parameters of micro-connectome topology, 
      often informed by economical principles that conceptually originated with Ramón y 
      Cajal's conservation laws. First, we summarize results from studies in intact 
      small organisms and in samples from larger nervous systems. We then evaluate the 
      evidence for an economical trade-off between biological cost and functional value 
      in the organization of neuronal networks. Various results suggest that many 
      aspects of neuronal network organization are indeed the outcome of competition 
      between these two fundamental selection pressures.

AB  - Most major psychiatric disorders arise from disturbances of anatomically 
      distributed neural systems rather than isolated dysfunction of circumscribed 
      brain regions. The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in our capacity to 
      measure, map, and model neural connectivity in diverse species and at different 
      resolution scales, from the level of individual neurons and synapses to 
      large-scale systems spanning the entire brain. In this review, we consider how 
      these techniques, when grounded in the theory and methods of network science, can 
      contribute to a biological understanding of mental illness. We focus in 
      particular on attempts to accurately map brain network disturbances in clinical 
      populations and to model the mechanistic causes of these changes. This work 
      suggests that pathology within highly connected hub regions is a consistent 
      finding across a broad array of phenotypically diverse disorders, and that 
      disparate changes in brain network organization can sometimes be explained by a 
      surprisingly small and simple set of mechanisms.

AB  - Connectomics has focused primarily on the mapping of synaptic links in the brain; 
      yet it is well established that extrasynaptic volume transmission, especially via 
      monoamines and neuropeptides, is also critical to brain function and occurs 
      primarily outside the synaptic connectome. We have mapped the putative monoamine 
      connections, as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections, in C. elegans based 
      on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide 
      networks exhibit distinct topological properties, with the monoamine network 
      displaying a highly disassortative star-like structure with a rich-club of 
      interconnected broadcasting hubs, and the neuropeptide network showing a more 
      recurrent, highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between 
      the extrasynaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes, we find 
      highly significant multilink motifs of interaction, pinpointing locations in the 
      network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity. 
      Thus, the C. elegans connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with 
      synaptic, gap junction, and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes 
      of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for 
      understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved 
      by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or 
      junctional circuits and extrasynaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small 
      number of modulatory neurons.

TI  - Immuno-psychiatry: an agenda for clinical practice and innovative research.
PG  - 173
LID - 173
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders is currently based 
      purely on descriptive nomenclature given that biomarkers subtypes and clearly 
      defined causal mechanisms are lacking for the vast majority of disorders. The 
      emerging field of "immuno-psychiatry" has the potential to widen the exploration 
      of a mechanism-based nosology, possibly leading to the discovery of more 
      effective personalised treatment strategies. DISCUSSION: Disturbances in 
      immuno-inflammatory and related systems have been implicated in the aetiology, 
      pathophysiology, phenomenology and comorbidity of several psychiatric disorders, 
      including major mood disorders and schizophrenia. A fundamental challenge in 
      their clinical management is to identify bio-signatures that might indicate risk, 
      state, trait, prognosis or theragnosis. Here, we provide the rationale for a 
      clinical and research agenda to refine future clinical practice and conceptual 
      views, and to delineate pathways toward innovative treatment discovery. 
      CONCLUSION: The development of bio-signatures will allow clinicians to tailor 
      interventions to the abovementioned biomarker subtypes - a major translational 
      goal for research in this field.

TI  - Small-World Brain Networks Revisited.
PG  - 499-516
LID - 10.1177/1073858416667720 [doi]
AB  - It is nearly 20 years since the concept of a small-world network was first 
      quantitatively defined, by a combination of high clustering and short path 
      length; and about 10 years since this metric of complex network topology began to 
      be widely applied to analysis of neuroimaging and other neuroscience data as part 
      of the rapid growth of the new field of connectomics. Here, we review briefly the 
      foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and generation of 
      small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key developments in the field 
      in the past decade and we consider in some detail the implications of recent 
      studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to map the anatomical 
      networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw attention to the 
      important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or 
      unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain 
      network analysis in the past, and the topology of weighted graphs, which retain 
      more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the 
      increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary 
      tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude by highlighting some 
      possible future trends in the further development of weighted small-worldness as 
      part of a deeper and broader understanding of the topology and the functional 
      value of the strong and weak links between areas of mammalian cortex.

AB  - Anatomical tract tracing methods are the gold standard for estimating the weight 
      of axonal connectivity between a pair of pre-defined brain regions. Large 
      studies, comprising hundreds of experiments, have become feasible by automated 
      methods. However, this comes at the cost of positive-mean noise making it 
      difficult to detect weak connections, which are of particular interest as recent 
      high resolution tract-tracing studies of the macaque have identified many more 
      weak connections, adding up to greater connection density of cortical networks, 
      than previously recognized. We propose a statistical framework that estimates 
      connectivity weights and credibility intervals from multiple tract-tracing 
      experiments. We model the observed signal as a log-normal distribution generated 
      by a combination of tracer fluorescence and positive-mean noise, also accounting 
      for injections into multiple regions. Using anterograde viral tract-tracing data 
      provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences, we estimate the connection 
      density of the mouse intra-hemispheric cortical network to be 73% (95% 
      credibility interval (CI): 71%, 75%); higher than previous estimates (40%). 
      Inter-hemispheric density was estimated to be 59% (95% CI: 54%, 62%). The weakest 
      estimable connections (about 6 orders of magnitude weaker than the strongest 
      connections) are likely to represent only one or a few axons. These extremely 
      weak connections are topologically more random and longer distance than the 
      strongest connections, which are topologically more clustered and shorter 
      distance (spatially clustered). Weak links do not substantially contribute to the 
      global topology of a weighted brain graph, but incrementally increased 
      topological integration of a binary graph. The topology of weak anatomical 
      connections in the mouse brain, rigorously estimable down to the biological limit 
      of a single axon between cortical areas in these data, suggests that they might 
      confer functional advantages for integrative information processing and/or they 
      might represent a stochastic factor in the development of the mouse connectome.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the potential of whole-brain computational models 
      to provide mechanistic insights into resting-state brain networks. It is 
      therefore important to determine the degree to which computational models 
      reproduce the topological features of empirical functional brain networks. We 
      used empirical connectivity data derived from diffusion spectrum and 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy 
      individuals. Empirical and simulated functional networks, constrained by 
      structural connectivity, were defined based on 66 brain anatomical regions 
      (nodes). Simulated functional data were generated using the Kuramoto model in 
      which each anatomical region acts as a phase oscillator. Network topology was 
      studied using graph theory in the empirical and simulated data. The difference 
      (relative error) between graph theory measures derived from empirical and 
      simulated data was then estimated. We found that simulated data can be used with 
      confidence to model graph measures of global network organization at different 
      dynamic states and highlight the sensitive dependence of the solutions obtained 
      in simulated data on the specified connection densities. This study provides a 
      method for the quantitative evaluation and external validation of graph theory 
      metrics derived from simulated data that can be used to inform future study 
      designs.

AB  - How does human brain structure mature during adolescence? We used MRI to measure 
      cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers 
      aged 14-24 y old. We found and replicated that association cortical areas were 
      thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 y. However, 
      association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course 
      of adolescence. Age-related increases in cortical myelination were maximized 
      approximately at the internal layer of projection neurons. Adolescent cortical 
      myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a 
      dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, 
      oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and 
      biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of 
      shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same 
      transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. We conclude that normative 
      human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating 
      anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this 
      consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral 
      changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.

TI  - Default Mode Hypoconnectivity Underlies a Sex-Related Autism Spectrum.
PG  - 364-371
AB  - BACKGROUND: Females and males differ significantly in the prevalence and 
      presentation of autism spectrum conditions. One theory of this effect postulates 
      that autistic traits lie on a sex-related continuum in the general population, 
      and autism represents the extreme male end of this spectrum. This theory predicts 
      that any feature of autism in males should 1) be present in autistic females, 2) 
      differentiate between the sexes in the typical population, and 3) correlate with 
      autistic traits. We tested these three predictions for default mode network (DMN) 
      hypoconnectivity during the resting state, one of the most robustly found 
      neurobiological differences in autism. METHODS: We analyzed a primary dataset of 
      adolescents (N = 121, 12-18 years of age) containing a relatively large number of 
      females and a replication multisite dataset including children, adolescents, and 
      adults (N = 980, 6-58 years of age). We quantified the average connectivity 
      between DMN regions and tested for group differences and correlation with 
      behavioral performance using robust regression. RESULTS: We found significant 
      differences in DMN intraconnectivity between female controls and females with 
      autism (p = .001 in the primary dataset; p = .009 in the replication dataset), 
      and between female controls and male controls (p = .036 in the primary dataset; p 
      = .002 in the replication dataset). We also found a significant correlation 
      between DMN intraconnectivity and performance on a mentalizing task (p = .001) in 
      the primary dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings provide the first 
      evidence for DMN hypoconnectivity as a behaviorally relevant neuroimaging 
      phenotype of the sex-related spectrum of autistic traits, of which autism 
      represents the extreme case.

TI  - Carrots and sticks fail to change behavior in cocaine addiction.
PG  - 1468-71
LID - 10.1126/science.aaf3700 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine addiction is a major public health problem that is particularly difficult 
      to treat. Without medically proven pharmacological treatments, interventions to 
      change the maladaptive behavior of addicted individuals mainly rely on 
      psychosocial approaches. Here we report on impairments in cocaine-addicted 
      patients to act purposefully toward a given goal and on the influence of extended 
      training on their behavior. When patients were rewarded for their behavior, 
      prolonged training improved their response rate toward the goal but 
      simultaneously rendered them insensitive to the consequences of their actions. By 
      contrast, overtraining of avoidance behavior had no effect on patient 
      performance. Our findings illustrate the ineffectiveness of punitive approaches 
      and highlight the potential for interventions that focus on improving 
      goal-directed behavior and implementing more desirable habits to replace habitual 
      drug-taking.

TI  - Peripheral Immune Cell Populations Associated with Cognitive Deficits and 
      Negative Symptoms of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia.
PG  - e0155631

LID - e0155631
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothetically, psychotic disorders could be caused or conditioned by 
      immunological mechanisms. If so, one might expect there to be peripheral immune 
      system phenotypes that are measurable in blood cells as biomarkers of psychotic 
      states. METHODS: We used multi-parameter flow cytometry of venous blood to 
      quantify and determine the activation state of 73 immune cell subsets for 18 
      patients with chronic schizophrenia (17 treated with clozapine), and 18 healthy 
      volunteers matched for age, sex, BMI and smoking. We used multivariate methods 
      (partial least squares) to reduce dimensionality and define populations of 
      differentially co-expressed cell counts in the cases compared to controls. 
      RESULTS: Schizophrenia cases had increased relative numbers of NK cells, naïve B 
      cells, CXCR5+ memory T cells and classical monocytes; and decreased numbers of 
      dendritic cells (DC), HLA-DR+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and CD4+ memory T 
      cells. Likewise, within the patient group, more severe negative and cognitive 
      symptoms were associated with decreased relative numbers of dendritic cells, 
      HLA-DR+ Tregs, and CD4+ memory T cells. Motivated by the importance of central 
      nervous system dopamine signalling for psychosis, we measured dopamine receptor 
      gene expression in separated CD4+ cells. Expression of the dopamine D3 (DRD3) 
      receptor was significantly increased in clozapine-treated schizophrenia and 
      covaried significantly with differentiated T cell classes in the CD4+ lineage. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral immune cell populations and dopaminergic signalling are 
      disrupted in clozapine-treated schizophrenia. Immuno-phenotypes may provide 
      peripherally accessible and mechanistically specific biomarkers of residual 
      cognitive and negative symptoms in this treatment-resistant subgroup of patients.

TI  - Absolute Measurements of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor and 
      Interleukin-1-β mRNA Levels Accurately Predict Treatment Response in Depressed 
      Patients.
LID - pyw045 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyw045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased levels of inflammation have been associated with a poorer 
      response to antidepressants in several clinical samples, but these findings have 
      had been limited by low reproducibility of biomarker assays across laboratories, 
      difficulty in predicting response probability on an individual basis, and unclear 
      molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Here we measured absolute mRNA values (a reliable 
      quantitation of number of molecules) of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor 
      and interleukin-1β in a previously published sample from a randomized controlled 
      trial comparing escitalopram vs nortriptyline (GENDEP) as well as in an 
      independent, naturalistic replication sample. We then used linear discriminant 
      analysis to calculate mRNA values cutoffs that best discriminated between 
      responders and nonresponders after 12 weeks of antidepressants. As Macrophage 
      Migration Inhibitory Factor and interleukin-1β might be involved in different 
      pathways, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network by the Search Tool 
      for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. RESULTS: We identified cutoff 
      values for the absolute mRNA measures that accurately predicted response 
      probability on an individual basis, with positive predictive values and 
      specificity for nonresponders of 100% in both samples (negative predictive 
      value=82% to 85%, sensitivity=52% to 61%). Using network analysis, we identified 
      different clusters of targets for these 2 cytokines, with Macrophage Migration 
      Inhibitory Factor interacting predominantly with pathways involved in 
      neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and cell proliferation, and interleukin-1β 
      interacting predominantly with pathways involved in the inflammasome complex, 
      oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: We believe that these data 
      provide a clinically suitable approach to the personalization of antidepressant 
      therapy: patients who have absolute mRNA values above the suggested cutoffs could 
      be directed toward earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, 
      including the addition of other antidepressants or antiinflammatory drugs.

AB  - We introduce comparative connectomics, the quantitative study of cross-species 
      commonalities and variations in brain network topology that aims to discover 
      general principles of network architecture of nervous systems and the 
      identification of species-specific features of brain connectivity. By comparing 
      connectomes derived from simple to more advanced species, we identify two 
      conserved themes of wiring: the tendency to organize network topology into 
      communities that serve specialized functionality and the general drive to enable 
      high topological integration by means of investment of neural resources in short 
      communication paths, hubs, and rich clubs. Within the space of wiring 
      possibilities that conform to these common principles, we argue that differences 
      in connectome organization between closely related species support adaptations in 
      cognition and behavior.

TI  - Is it time for immunopsychiatry in psychotic disorders?
PG  - 1651-60
LID - 10.1007/s00213-016-4266-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immune dysregulation is suggested to play an important aetiological 
      role in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) potentially driving 
      neurodevelopmental pathways. Immune dysfunction may precede the onset of 
      psychiatric disorders and parallel the development of multiaxial comorbidity, 
      including suicidal behaviour and metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Depicting 
      the source of the chronic low-grade inflammatory component in SZ and BD is thus a 
      research priority. Strong environmental insults early in life, such as 
      infections, acting on a background of genetic vulnerability, may induce potent 
      and enduring inflammatory responses setting a state of liability to second-hit 
      environmental encounters, namely childhood trauma, drug abuse or additional 
      infectious exposures. The immunogenetic background of susceptibility, suggested 
      to be not only lying within the HLA locus but also implicating inherited deficits 
      of the innate immune system, may amplify the harmful biological effects of 
      infections/psychosocial stress leading to the manifestation of a broad range of 
      psychiatric symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The present review aims to discuss the 
      following: (i) biological arguments in favour of a chronic low-grade inflammation 
      in SZ and BD and its potential origin in the interaction between the 
      immunogenetic background and environmental infectious insults, and (ii) the 
      consequences of this inflammatory dysfunction by focusing on N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      (NMDA) receptor antibodies and activation of the family of human endogenous 
      retroviruses (HERVs). CONCLUSIONS: Specific therapeutic approaches targeting 
      immune pathways may lead the way to novel personalized medical interventions, 
      improvement of quality of life and average life expectancy of psychiatric 
      patients, if not even prevent mood episodes and psychotic symptoms.

TI  - Altered Hub Functioning and Compensatory Activations in the Connectome: A 
      Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 434-42
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia have identified 
      abnormal activations in many brain regions. In an effort to interpret these 
      findings from a network perspective, we carried out a meta-analysis of this 
      literature, mapping anatomical locations of under- and over-activation to the 
      topology of a normative human functional connectome. METHODS: We included 314 
      task-based functional neuroimaging studies including more than 5000 patients with 
      schizophrenia and over 5000 controls. Coordinates of significant under- or 
      over-activations in patients relative to controls were mapped to nodes of a 
      normative connectome defined by a prior meta-analysis of 1641 functional 
      neuroimaging studies of task-related activation in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: 
      Under-activations and over-activations were reported in a wide diversity of brain 
      regions. Both under- and over-activations were significantly more likely to be 
      located in hub nodes that constitute the "rich club" or core of the normative 
      connectome. In a subset of 121 studies that reported both under- and 
      over-activations in the same patients, we found that, in network terms, these 
      abnormalities were located in close topological proximity to each other. 
      Under-activation in a peripheral node was more frequently associated specifically 
      with over-activation of core nodes than with over-activation of another 
      peripheral node. CONCLUSIONS: Although schizophrenia is associated with altered 
      brain functional activation in a wide variety of regions, abnormal responses are 
      concentrated in hubs of the normative connectome. Task-specific under-activation 
      in schizophrenia is accompanied by over-activation of topologically central, less 
      functionally specialized network nodes, which may represent a compensatory 
      response.

      adolescents.
PG  - 140-52
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2015.07.015 [doi]
AB  - Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable markers that may assist in the 
      identification of the complex genetic underpinnings of psychiatric conditions. 
      Here we examined global hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism spectrum 
      conditions (ASCs). We studied well-matched groups of adolescent males with 
      autism, genetically-related siblings of individuals with autism, and 
      typically-developing control participants. We parcellated the brain into 258 
      regions and used complex-network analysis to detect a robust hypoconnectivity 
      endophenotype in our participant group. We observed that whole-brain functional 
      connectivity was highest in controls, intermediate in siblings, and lowest in 
      ASC, in task and rest conditions. We identified additional, local endophenotype 
      effects in specific networks including the visual processing and default mode 
      networks. Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional 
      hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence, and may thus 
      underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their 
      relatives.

TI  - Randomization and resilience of brain functional networks as systems-level 
      endophenotypes of schizophrenia.
PG  - 9123-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1502052112 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is increasingly conceived as a disorder of brain network 
      organization or dysconnectivity syndrome. Functional MRI (fMRI) networks in 
      schizophrenia have been characterized by abnormally random topology. We tested 
      the hypothesis that network randomization is an endophenotype of schizophrenia 
      and therefore evident also in nonpsychotic relatives of patients. Head 
      movement-corrected, resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 25 patients with 
      schizophrenia, 25 first-degree relatives of patients, and 29 healthy volunteers. 
      Graphs were used to model functional connectivity as a set of edges between 
      regional nodes. We estimated the topological efficiency, clustering, degree 
      distribution, resilience, and connection distance (in millimeters) of each 
      functional network. The schizophrenic group demonstrated significant 
      randomization of global network metrics (reduced clustering, greater efficiency), 
      a shift in the degree distribution to a more homogeneous form (fewer hubs), a 
      shift in the distance distribution (proportionally more long-distance edges), and 
      greater resilience to targeted attack on network hubs. The networks of the 
      relatives also demonstrated abnormal randomization and resilience compared with 
      healthy volunteers, but they were typically less topologically abnormal than the 
      patients' networks and did not have abnormal connection distances. We conclude 
      that schizophrenia is associated with replicable and convergent evidence for 
      functional network randomization, and a similar topological profile was evident 
      also in nonpsychotic relatives, suggesting that this is a systems-level 
      endophenotype or marker of familial risk. We speculate that the greater 
      resilience of brain networks may confer some fitness advantages on nonpsychotic 
      relatives that could explain persistence of this endophenotype in the population.

AB  - Connectome mapping using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) has become a focus of systems neuroscience. There remain many statistical 
      challenges in analysis of functional connectivity and network architecture from 
      BOLD fMRI multivariate time series. One key statistic for any time series is its 
      (effective) degrees of freedom, df, which will generally be less than the number 
      of time points (or nominal degrees of freedom, N). If we know the df, then 
      probabilistic inference on other fMRI statistics, such as the correlation between 
      two voxel or regional time series, is feasible. However, we currently lack good 
      estimators of df in fMRI time series, especially after the degrees of freedom of 
      the "raw" data have been modified substantially by denoising algorithms for head 
      movement. Here, we used a wavelet-based method both to denoise fMRI data and to 
      estimate the (effective) df of the denoised process. We show that seed voxel 
      correlations corrected for locally variable df could be tested for false positive 
      connectivity with better control over Type I error and greater specificity of 
      anatomical mapping than probabilistic connectivity maps using the nominal degrees 
      of freedom. We also show that wavelet despiked statistics can be used to estimate 
      all pairwise correlations between a set of regional nodes, assign a P value to 
      each edge, and then iteratively add edges to the graph in order of increasing P. 
      These probabilistically thresholded graphs are likely more robust to regional 
      variation in head movement effects than comparable graphs constructed by 
      thresholding correlations. Finally, we show that time-windowed estimates of df 
      can be used for probabilistic connectivity testing or dynamic network analysis so 
      that apparent changes in the functional connectome are appropriately corrected 
      for the effects of transient noise bursts. Wavelet despiking is both an algorithm 
      for fMRI time series denoising and an estimator of the (effective) df of denoised 
      fMRI time series. Accurate estimation of df offers many potential advantages for 
      probabilistically thresholding functional connectivity and network statistics 
      tested in the context of spatially variant and non-stationary noise. Code for 
      wavelet despiking, seed correlational testing and probabilistic graph 
      construction is freely available to download as part of the BrainWavelet Toolbox 
      at www.brainwavelet.org.

AB  - The dedifferentiation theory of aging proposes that a reduction in the 
      specificity of neural representations causes declines in complex cognition as 
      people get older, and may reflect a reduction in dopaminergic signaling. The 
      present pharmacological fMRI study investigated episodic memory-related 
      dedifferentiation in young and older adults, and its relation to dopaminergic 
      function, using a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design 
      with the agonist Bromocriptine (1.25mg) and the antagonist Sulpiride (400mg). We 
      used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure memory specificity: the degree to 
      which distributed patterns of activity distinguishing two different task contexts 
      during an encoding phase are reinstated during memory retrieval. As predicted, 
      memory specificity was reduced in older adults in prefrontal cortex and in 
      hippocampus, consistent with an impact of neural dedifferentiation on episodic 
      memory representations. There was also a linear age-dependent dopaminergic 
      modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus reflecting a relative boost to 
      memory specificity on Bromocriptine in older adults whose memory was poorer at 
      baseline, and a relative boost on Sulpiride in older better performers, compared 
      to the young. This differed from generalized effects of both agents on task 
      specificity in the encoding phase. The results demonstrate a link between aging, 
      dopaminergic function and dedifferentiation in the hippocampus.

AB  - The study of spontaneous brain activity using fMRI is central to mapping brain 
      networks. However, current fMRI methodology has limitations in the study of small 
      animal brain organization using ultra-high field fMRI experiments, as imaging 
      artifacts are difficult to control and the relationship between classical 
      neuroanatomy and spontaneous functional BOLD activity is not fully established. 
      Challenges are especially prevalent during the fMRI study of individual rodent 
      brains, which could be instrumental to studies of disease progression and 
      pharmacology. A recent advance in fMRI methodology enables unbiased, accurate, 
      and comprehensive identification of functional BOLD signals by interfacing 
      multi-echo (ME) fMRI acquisition, NMR signal decay analysis, and independent 
      components analysis (ICA), in a procedure called ME-ICA. Here we present a pilot 
      study on the suitability of ME-ICA for ultra high field animal fMRI studies of 
      spontaneous brain activity under anesthesia. ME-ICA applied to 11.7 T fMRI data 
      of rats first showed robust performance in automatic high dimensionality 
      estimation and ICA decomposition, similar to that previously reported for 3.0 T 
      human data. ME sequence optimization for 11.7 T indicated that 3 echoes, 0.5mm 
      isotropic voxel size and TR=3s was adequate for sensitive and specific BOLD 
      signal acquisition. Next, in seeking optimal inhaled isoflurane anesthesia 
      dosage, we report that progressive increase in anesthesia goes with concomitant 
      decrease in statistical complexity of "global" functional activity, as measured 
      by the number of BOLD components, or degrees of freedom (DOF). Finally, BOLD 
      functional connectivity maps for individual rodents at the component level show 
      that spontaneous BOLD activity follows classical neuroanatomy, and seed-based 
      analysis shows plausible cortical-cortical and cortical-subcortical functional 
      interactions.

TI  - The hubs of the human connectome are generally implicated in the anatomy of brain 
      disorders.

AB  - Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly connected hub nodes 
      that are functionally valuable, because their topological centrality supports 
      integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that 
      hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other 
      brain regions, and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming 
      that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological 
      cost, we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub 
      regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first identified the hubs of brain 
      anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy 
      volunteers (n = 56), and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs 
      disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random 
      attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps, based on meta-analyses of 
      published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 
      different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common 
      across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal 
      brain connectome (P < 10(-4), permutation test). Specifically, nine brain 
      disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs 
      (P < 0.05, permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. 
      Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions, 
      although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in 
      each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion 
      probability in Alzheimer's disease, whereas in schizophrenia lesions were 
      concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking 
      pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal 
      diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were 
      defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional 
      neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional 
      co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human 
      brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many 
      (if not all) brain disorders.

AB  - In recent years, pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from 
      an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to 
      characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has 
      paralleled rapid advances in connectomics, a field concerned with comprehensively 
      mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. 
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts, as 
      it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale 
      architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper, we provide a brief 
      introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent 
      developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain 
      disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. 
      Specifically, we consider how research into circuit-level, connectome-wide and 
      topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological 
      theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings 
      highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of 
      disturbances in an interconnected complex system, rather than discrete pathology 
      in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain connectivity and altered 
      neurodevelopmental processes. Cross-sectional case-control studies in different 
      age groups have suggested that deficits in cortical thickness in childhood-onset 
      schizophrenia may normalize over time, suggesting a disorder-related difference 
      in cortical growth trajectories. METHODS: We acquired magnetic resonance imaging 
      scans repeated over several years for each subject, in a sample of 106 patients 
      with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 102 age-matched healthy volunteers. Using 
      semiparametric regression, we modeled the effect of schizophrenia on the growth 
      curve of cortical thickness in ~80,000 locations across the cortex, in the age 
      range 8 to 30 years. In addition, we derived normative developmental modules 
      composed of cortical regions with similar maturational trajectories for cortical 
      thickness in typical brain development. RESULTS: We found abnormal nonlinear 
      growth processes in prefrontal and temporal areas that have previously been 
      implicated in schizophrenia, distinguishing for the first time between cortical 
      areas with age-constant deficits in cortical thickness and areas whose 
      maturational trajectories are altered in schizophrenia. In addition, we showed 
      that when the brain is divided into five normative developmental modules, the 
      areas with abnormal cortical growth overlap significantly only with the 
      cingulo-fronto-temporal module. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abnormal 
      cortical development in schizophrenia may be modularized or constrained by the 
      normal community structure of developmental modules of the human brain 
      connectome.

TI  - Obstetric complications and autoantibodies in schizophrenia.
PG  - 270-3
AB  - Our hypothesis stated that patients with schizophrenia who had obstetric 
      complications (OC) were more likely to have autoimmune abnormalities than those 
      without OC. OC were rated using a checklist. Anti-brain autoantibodies were 
      measured in serum using an enzyme immunoassay. Autoantibodies to non-CNS tissues 
      were detected using serological procedures. There were no significant differences 
      between the groups with respect to anti-brain antibodies, but patients with OC (n 
      = 24) had a significantly higher prevalence of autoantibodies to non-CNS tissues 
      than patients without OC (n = 25). Both groups were receiving neuroleptic drugs. 
      OC may contribute to autoimmune abnormalities among patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Differences in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) between healthy dextral and non-dextral 
      subjects.
PG  - 185-8
AB  - Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured in picograms/ml pg/ml using an 
      immunoassay (ELISA) in healthy individuals (n = 148), of whom 128 were classified 
      as dextral and 20 as non-dextral, as per a laterality questionnaire. Only 3 (15%) 
      non-dextral individuals had serum IL-6 levels above the lower limit of the assay 
      sensitivity as compared to 59 (46%) of dextral individuals (P < 0.013). There 
      were no significant correlations between previously determined mitogen stimulated 
      interleukin-2 production and autoantibodies in a subset of the same individuals. 
      While this data does not provide casual information, it adds to the evidence of 
      the asymmetric regulation of immune functions by the cerebral hemispheres.

TI  - Immune abnormalities in schizophrenia: evidence for the autoimmune hypothesis.
PG  - 70-83
AB  - The autoimmune basis for schizophrenia has been investigated for the last 60 
      years. Although numerous immune abnormalities have been reported, the current 
      literature is viewed with much skepticism because most of the studies have failed 
      to control for extraneous factors that may have influenced the findings. 
      Principally, antipsychotic medication, duration of illness, and current clinical 
      state (acutely psychotic or remitted) may considerably alter immune response, as 
      may other factors such as nutritional status, substance abuse, and concurrent 
      medical illness. We review recent studies that employed current diagnostic 
      criteria and modern immunologic techniques. (These studies were located by use of 
      a Medline search on the terms schizophrenia and psychosis, cross-referenced with 
      immune abnormalities, lymphokines, antibodies, lymphocytes, HLA, and medication, 
      and by perusing the reference lists in the articles found through this search.) 
      Immune abnormalities that have been replicated in studies of schizophrenic 
      patients include increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, decreased 
      production of interleukin-2, and increased serum concentrations of interleukin-2 
      receptor and interleukin-6. Given the current importance of autoimmunity as an 
      etiologic mechanism in several branches of medicine, further studies are needed, 
      especially those having a longitudinal design and including drug-naive patients.

TI  - An association between anti-hippocampal antibody concentration and lymphocyte 
      production of IL-2 in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 449-55
AB  - Serum concentrations of anti-hippocampal antibodies and in vitro production of 
      the lymphokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) 
      stimulation were determined using an enzyme immunoassay in 49 schizophrenic 
      patients and 41 healthy controls. Decrease in IL-2 production, a finding 
      frequently associated with many autoimmune diseases, was associated with an 
      elevation in anti-hippocampal antibody optical density (AHA-OD) in schizophrenic 
      patients. Although some control subjects had elevated antibody levels, this 
      elevation was not associated with decreased IL-2 production. Low IL-2 production 
      is well known to be a state marker associated with active autoimmune disease. We 
      suggest that production of hippocampal antibody is a trait marker of 
      vulnerability to autoimmune diseases. Thus, our finding of low IL-2 production in 
      patients with high concentrations of hippocampal antibody is compatible with the 
      possibility that such patients have an ongoing autoimmune process.

TI  - The prevalence of autoantibodies among right and left handed schizophrenic 
      patients and control subjects.
PG  - 803-11
AB  - Sera from schizophrenic patients (n = 186) and healthy control subjects (n = 346) 
      were tested for the presence of seven common autoantibodies by standard 
      immunological methods. The association between handedness and autoantibodies was 
      tested in a multi-way contingency table using a log-linear model. For men, but 
      not women, nondextrals (patients and controls) were twice as likely to test 
      positive for autoantibodies than dextrals (p = 0.0002). Although more women (33%) 
      than men (24%) tested positive for autoantibodies, handedness was not a 
      distinguishing factor among women. These data suggest that sinistrality and 
      gender are associated with autoantibodies in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients 
      and healthy control subjects.
