                     Accumulating evidence indicate a role for the immune system particularly inﬂammation and autoimmunity in the aeti-
                     ology of major psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we discuss some of the key
                     advances in immunopsychiatry in order to highlight to psychiatrists and other health professionals how an increased
                     understanding of this ﬁeld might enhance our knowledge of illness mechanism and approaches to treatment. We present
                     a brief overview of clinical research that link inﬂammation and autoimmunity with depression and psychosis, including
                     potential role of inﬂammation in treatment response, current evidence for the effectiveness of immune-modulating
                     treatment for depression and psychosis, and possible role of inﬂammation in common physical comorbidities for
                     these disorders such as coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Gaining a better understanding of the role of
                     immune system could be paradigm changing for psychiatry. We need collaborations between clinicians and scientists
                     to deliver high-quality translational research in order to fully realise the clinical potential of this exciting and rapidly
                     expanding ﬁeld.

IntroductionImmunopsychiatry is a novel and expanding subfield of psychoneuroimmunology that deals with the interaction between our immune system and psychiatric disorders. Neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease are attracting more attention due to their broad spectrum and link to disease pathogenesis. Autoantibody-associated psychiatric disorders are of growing interest as the therapy is demanding and differs from standard psychopharmacological drug therapy. Psychiatric disorders associated with neural autoantibodies can be classified as autoimmune-mediated psychiatric disease when these neural autoantibodies occur in conjunction with specific clinical features, signs of central nervous system inflammation in neuroimaging, or in biomaterial probes such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (1–4).Antineural Autoantibodies in Psychiatric Disease – Novel DevelopmentsA still enigmatic topic in autoantibody-related immunopsychiatry is whether psychopathology is influenced or even driven by the presence of autoantibodies. A recent study (5) showed that specific psychopathologic features are associated with specific autoantibodies, thus highlighting the relationship between a psychopathology’s pathogenesis and autoantibodies. A large sample of 461 psychotic patients was screened for autoantibodies in this study. Psychosis is a severe and debilitating disease condition characterized by psychopathology consisting of delusions, hallucinations or ego disturbances. They screened a subcohort of 24 patients for autoantibodies via protein arrays and detected six different autoantibodies associated with specific psychopathological features. Anti-adaptor-related protein complex 3, beta 2 subunit (AP3B2) antibodies were identified in conjunction with persecutory delusions, whereas anti-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) antibodies were more frequently co-detected with hallucinations in patients. Affective symptoms such as anhedonia and dysphoria were related to anti-recombinant WAS protein homologously associated with actin, Golgi membranes and microtubules pseudogene 3 (WHAMMP3) antibodies. Cognitive dysfunction was found to be mainly associated with anti-olfactomedin 1 (OLFM1) antibodies, and sleep dysfunction (insomnia) in patients was associated with anti-Gamma-crystallin N (CRYGN) antibodies. These examples in  Jernbom Falk´s study (2021) demonstrate that specific psychopathologic features might help deliver clues about which autoantibodies might be worth searching for. However, the likelihood of detecting autoantibodies is much higher if specific syndromes are present, ie, a psycho-organic syndrome accompanying cognitive dysfunction or paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome, as a recent cohort study showed that psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most relevant psychiatric conditions associated with autoantibodies (6). Although the occurrence of autoantibodies in first-episode psychosis is rare (7), neural autoantibodies are detected in first-episode psychosis, thus requiring a differential diagnosis including the search for autoantibodies. However, it is unclear which kind of first-episode psychotic patients warrant an autoantibody search. Unspecific indicators like autoimmune indicators are relevant, such as an actual or recent tumor diagnosis, movement disorder, altered consciousness, seizures, optic hallucinations, infectious prodrome with fever or aphasia, dysarthria and mutism (1, 3, 8). We do not yet know how these indicators are weighted specifically, apart from grouping them into minor and major indicators. According to our recent review (1), major indicators like seizures or a decreased level of consciousness and minor autoimmune indicators such as early resistance to therapy and fluctuating psychopathology can be distinguished. There would be major practical consequences if we knew which specific psychopathological parameters indicate a potential anti-neural autoantibody-mediated psychosis, for instance. In light of these reflections, Jernbom Falk´s study findings (2021) are very promising. We tested the psychopathological profiles of a cohort of psychiatric patients and found that psychiatric syndromes that are mainly psycho-organic and depressive reveal fewer affective symptoms in specific categories (like affective rigidity or rumination) than those patients without anti-neural autoantibodies (unpublished observations). These findings indicate that patients with a psycho-organic and depressive syndrome associated with neural-autoantibodies might have a psychopathology different from that in patients not presenting (anti-neural autoantibodies). This factor indicates the direction of potential psychopathological patterns associated with psychiatric disease in conjunction with autoantibodies. These studies illustrate the relevance of psychopathology for diagnostic purposes apart from grouping patients into diagnostic classification systems such as international classifications of diseases.Potential Pathogenesis of Autoantibody-Associated Psychiatric DiseaseThe pathogenesis of neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is still not well understood, although there are pathophysiological models for several autoantibodies implying that autoantibodies per se might play a pathogenic role in the development of psychiatric symptoms and behavior. An animal model recently showed that a neuropsychiatric phenotype of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is modulated by NMDAR autoantibodies (9). NMDAR is a glutamatergic receptor responsible for excitatory neuronal plasticity in the brain on the one hand and may trigger excitotoxicity on the other hand in the brain. However, it is debatable whether these autoantibodies cause the encephalitis itself or only modify it, as depicted in a recent study (10). Other studies in mice have shown that it is not the brain’s acute exposure to NMDAR autoantibodies but rather their long-lasting presence that causes a behavioral phenotype entailing impaired cognitive function (11). NMDAR autoantibody-induced alterations in synaptic transmission are believed to be a key step in generating psychotic symptoms concurring with schizophrenia’s glutamatergic model (12). NMDAR autoantibodies lead to NMDAR internalization and removal from the cell surface linking them to an extrasynaptic compartment. The conditions necessary for normal synaptic transmission are thus disturbed. Dysfunctional synaptic transmission could lead to psychiatric problems like psychotic symptoms. NMDAR trafficking to extrasynaptic compartments has been observed in patients with psychotic disorders, but not in autistic patients or healthy controls, as Wollmuth et al. (13) described. Their finding makes it tempting to wonder if there might not be a variety of unknown molecular mechanisms associated with NMDAR antibodies among diverse psychiatric disorders. More research is needed to determine the molecular mechanism induced by autoantibody blockage of NMDAR. Generated monoclonal NMDAR antibodies recently applied to neuronal cultures revealed that these have an impact on disinhibitory signaling in cortical neuronal networks (14). Disturbed inhibitory cortical neurotransmission supposedly results in a hyperexcitable state that could enhance the induction and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, the autoantibody class seems to play a major role in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. As membrane-surface autoantibodies like NMDAR autoantibodies are probably pathogenic themselves (15), T-cell dependent proinflammatory states are probably irrelevant in relation to a membrane-surface autoantibody-associated neuropsychiatric disease such as NMDAR encephalitis (16), but T-cells are relevant immune cells involved in autoantibodies against intracellular targets associated with neuropsychiatric disease (17). Other novel autoantibodies have been identified playing a potential tole in specific psychiatric diseases, ie, anti-hypothalamus autoantibodies in anorexia nervosa (18). They suggest that these autoantibodies disturb the physiological processes by interacting with hypothalamic cells leading to augmented secretion of anorexigenic signaling (18). Another autoantibody category attracting considerable attention recently is anti-basal ganglia autoantibodies, believed to be pathogenically relevant for a subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder (2, 19). As the basal ganglia play a key role in movement execution, anti-basal ganglia antibodies could play a pathogenic role in interfering with movement causing the repetitive behaviors and actions associated with obsessive compulsive disorder. These examples show how more animal models are needed to investigate specific subclasses of neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease.Novel Discoveries in Methods Relevant for ImmunopsychiatryImmune Cells in Biological ProbesImmune cells are potential biomarkers in patients with anti-neural autoantibody-related cognitive impairment and epilepsy, as recent investigations of ours showed (1, 20, 21). Recent evidence shows that cell flow cytometry is a promising method to evaluate immune cell subsets in psychotic disorders (22). CSF cell flowmetry is interesting as it helped detect a relative shift in immune cells from lymphocytes to monocytes in psychotic disorders, potentially indicating an altered adaptive immune system. Increased protein concentrations and blood-brain barrier disturbances have also been detected in these patients in line with those findings (22) indicating a leaky blood-brain barrier enabling immune-cell infiltration within the brain in patients suffering from psychotic disorders. These results show that flow cell cytometry is a potentially rewarding tool for clarifying questions related to cellular inflammation in patients with autoantibody-associated psychotic and neurocognitive syndromes. Flow cytometry should be applied with special focus on classic monocytes in psychosis (22) and CD4+ T-cells in verbal memory and executive functions should also be the spotlight of investigation (21). There is very recent and fascinating evidence of higher levels of CD3+CD4+CD25+Fox3 cells (also called regulatory T-cells) in the blood of patients with attention deficit hyperactive disorder compared to healthy controls (23). Elevated fractions of these regulatory T-cells thus seem to raise the risk of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (23). Another study by Gao et al. (24) addressed the usage of flow cell cytometry in monocytes and CD4+ T-cells in the blood of patients with bipolar disorder to measure lithium’s treatment efficacy. Indeed, a special flow- cytometric approach was employed to measure proteins and immune cells in this study. In this study we demonstrate that several proteins such as leptin, brain-derived growth factor, neurotrophin and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways are altered in patients responding to lithium, unlike in those who do not respond to it. Our preliminary findings reveal that flow cytometry in monocytes and CD4+ T-cells is a potentially useful technique when examining biomaterial samples to seek evidence in immunopsychiatry. To investigate a broader spectrum of proteins, other technologies like proteomics are preferable to flow cytometry for measuring proteins; they can supplement flow cytometry.Imaging NeuroinflammationRecent studies have described the potential of measuring neuroinflammation, ie, in schizophrenia (25) as a disease that severely affects cognition, emotions and daily life abilities or depression (26) accompanied by strong mood and psychomotor disturbances (by measuring the translocator protein 18kDa in activated microglia via PET imaging (TSPO). TSPO imaging has not yet been adopted in the clinical routine although the evidence regarding the detection of glial neuroinflammation in psychiatric disease has been promising. Further research should be extended to study the interaction between neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and acethylcholine and neuroinflammation via TSPO imaging in psychiatric and age-related, disease-associated anti-neural antibodies. TSPO imaging has proven useful in neuropsychiatric disease associated with autoantibodies such as lupus erythematosus, as (27) demonstrated in a recent study via the specific radioligand for TSPO named DPA (11C]DPA-713). Stronger DPA binding was shown in hippocampal and cerebellar regions in cognitively-impaired patients with neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus (27) indicating elevated glia cell activation in these regions. Glia cell activation underlie neuroinflammatory processes in lupus erythematosus patients, thereby yielding specific insights into the disease mechanisms of autoantibody-related psychiatric disease. TSPO imaging is known to facilitate the depiction of neuroinflammation in patients with major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (28), and dementia such as Alzheimer´s disease (29).Brain Morphology and InflammationFurther research should be done to discover promising regions to study psychopathologies and how they correlate with brain morphology. A recent study showed that a larger anterior insula volume is related to anxiety severity caused by inflammation (30). Another study (31) confirmed the link between inflammation by measuring cytokines and assessing brain morphology in psychiatric patients. Those authors (31) used blood cytokine markers from antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode psychotic patients, clustering these cytokines in inflammatory subtypes. Theoretical graph analyses were done to connect brain morphology and cytokine patterns classified as inflammatory subtypes in first-episode patients, which facilitated assessments of local and global network characteristics across inflammatory subtypes. Their study demonstrated enhanced regional volume of the right parahippocampal region, caudal anterior cingulate and bank superior sulcus in inflammation subtypes of schizophrenia. A similar link between neuroinflammation and brain volume was confirmed in another recent study with first-episode psychotic patients presenting a proinflammatory profile and elevated interferon gamma and interleukin 5, which were associated with lower total cortical volume (32). Lower cortical volumes might thus be associated with elevated cytokines indicating brain inflammation. Whether the brain inflammation is accompanied by a process involving a loss of brain volume, or the reduced brain volume itself triggers further inflammatory processes is unknown, and deserves further investigation. Another unexplored issue is where in the brain the inflammation in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease occurs. In a recent study of autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease, inflammatory processes were detected in motor structures like the basal ganglia, and in limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus region (33). However, the relationship between brain morphology and inflammation in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is sometimes hard to detect as the inflammation may only be mild and local and thus not visible on MRI or FDG PET neuroimaging exams or evident in CSF analysis. Zrzavy etal. (33) detected neuroinflammation in conjunction with inflammatory infiltration by parenchymal CD3/CD8+ T-cells and CD79a+ B-cells in parts of the basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus via postmortem immunopathological examinations. We therefore need innovative new methods to detect mild inflammation, as the current standard diagnostic procedures are inadequate. Peripheral inflammation might be informative as additional information for deciphering CNS inflammation, but often fail to correlate with CSF inflammation, as a recent study showed in patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (34). However, whether peripheral inflammation is useful is controversial, as another study showed upregulated complement mRNA expression in blood samples linked to cortical thinning in schizophrenia (35). More research is needed to clarify the role of peripheral inflammation in brain processes in anti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease and to take small changes in brain volume into account. Choroid plexus enlargement is another candidate for examination as altered brain structures may indicate an interrelationship between inflammation and brain morphology in term of substructures. A recent study reported an enlarged choroid plexus in patients with depression (36): the choroid-plexus volume correlated with binding in [11C]PK11195 PET/structural MRI imaging (36), confirming the link between neuroinflammation and choroid-plexus morphology. Assessing choroid-plexus morphology in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease might therefore be a future method to examine inflammation processes that are not yet clearly affecting white or gray matter morphology, but affect the choroid-plexus morphology early.LimitationsAnti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is a novel field that presents several challenges, namely too little knowledge and too few studies investigating this disease, its underlying pathomechanisms are unknown, and treatment options are rare and have usually not been examined in large patient cohorts. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoantibodies often relies on animal models that preclude a direct transfer of evidence to humans. These aspects should be kept in mind when combining autoantibody analysis in novel diagnostic approaches with knowledge about autoantibodies’ pathophysiologic actions. However, only by addressing these questions while applying novel and highly sophisticated techniques can autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease and its many unknown facets be further explored. In addition, we need to study other patterns of brain damage or brain inflammation between psychiatric patients presenting autoantibodies in comparison to psychiatric patients presenting no autoantibodies (apart from specific neural autoantibodies) via blood proteomics to identify specific patterns by which to distinguish disease groups.Synopsis – Marking Disease Activity in Neural Autoantibody-Mediated Psychiatric DiseaseOur short review indicates that there are several innovative techniques (summarized in Figure 1) to combine to better identify disease activity in psychiatric diseases associated with anti-neural autoantibodies. More effort should be invested to encourage attempts to apply these methods in order to understand the role of anti-neural autoantibodies in psychiatric disease. Different classification criteria have been developed for subtypes of autoantibody-mediated psychiatric disease such as autoimmune psychosis (3), autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (2), and autoimmune dementia (37). More effort is needed to improve and test the diagnostic usefulness of several methods and evidence that have not yet been confirmed in large-scale studies. The methods described in this review also require substantial testing in large populations to prove their diagnostic validity in different psychiatric patient samples in a cross-sectional, but also longitudinal manner.Figure 1Innovative technology for optimizing the characterization of autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease.

Here we examined global hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism spectrum conditions (ASCs). We studied well-matched groups of adolescent males with autism, genetically-related siblings of individuals with autism, and typically-developing control participants. We parcellated the brain into 258 regions and used complex-network analysis to detect a robust hypoconnectivity endophenotype in our participant group. We observed that whole-brain functional connectivity was highest in controls, intermediate in siblings, and lowest in ASC, in task and rest conditions. We identified additional, local endophenotype effects in specific networks including the visual processing and default mode networks. Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence, and may thus underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their relatives.Highlights•Adolescents with autism and genetic relatives show weaker functional connectivity.•This appears at a whole-brain level in several task contexts.•Connectivity in autism and in siblings is much more variable than in controls.•Local endophenotypes also appear in default mode network and visual network.•Hypoconnectivity is a feature of the broader and the diagnosable autism spectrum in adolescents.1IntroductionAutism spectrum conditions (ASCs) are common pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions which typically present in early childhood and manifest with characteristic impairments in communication and social relationships, alongside unusually repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Numerous studies have shown ASC to be highly heritable (Ronald and Hoekstra, 2011; Berg and Geschwind, 2012; Colvert et al., 2015), with genetic heritability estimated at 80% (Lichtenstein et al., 2010); one recent estimate suggests that siblings of people with autism are 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with an ASC than are members of the general population with no genetic relationship to an autistic proband (Grønborg et al., 2013). The complex polygenic interactions underlying ASC give rise to a continuous spectrum of subclinical and clinically diagnosed presentations (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001a; Hoekstra et al., 2007).The combination of high genetic heritability and heterogeneous presentation supports the search for endophenotypes of autism. Endophenotypes are the heritable and quantifiable – neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive or behavioural – markers of psychiatric conditions (Gottesman and Gould, 2003). Endophenotypes are found in patients and their asymptomatic relatives, and thus simplify the search for causes of complex psychiatric conditions by identifying genetically mediated and quantifiable traits that bind together diverse clinical presentations (Kalueff et al., 2015). Here we search for endophenotypes in a matched sample of males with ASC, unaffected siblings of people with ASC, and typically developing controls.A broader autistic phenotype (BAP) (Losh et al., 2009) has been identified at the behavioural level, with genetic relatives of autistic probands exhibiting more autistic traits than the general population (Constantino et al., 2010; Wheelwright et al., 2010) and more aloof, anxious, and rigid personality styles (Piven et al., 1997; Hurley et al., 2007). Whilst not meeting diagnostic criteria for ASC, they also display abnormalities and impairments resembling the core symptomatology of ASC in the domains of communication, social reciprocity and behavioural rigidity (Piven et al., 1997; Pickles et al., 2000; Losh et al., 2009), along with deficits in elements of executive function like planning, set-shifting and verbal fluency (Wong et al., 2006; Nydén et al., 2011).In contrast to the behavioural BAP, there is limited evidence for a corresponding broader neural phenotype of autism. Previous reports have shown that ASC-like cognitive profiles in relatives are associated with atypical brain activation in localised brain regions (Dawson et al., 2005; Baron-Cohen et al., 2006; Spencer et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Holt et al., 2014). Such studies produce spatial activation maps but do not describe interactions between brain regions. In contrast, functional connectivity analyses study distributed networks of correlated activity between brain regions (Fox and Raichle, 2007; Van Dijk et al., 2010). ASCs are now increasingly understood to present with system-wide differences in neural information processing (Minshew and Goldstein, 1998; Belmonte et al., 2004a, 2004b; Welchew et al., 2005; Geschwind and Levitt, 2007; Kana et al., 2011; Vissers et al., 2012; Uddin et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2014), and are conceptualised as “nonfocal, systemic… distributed neural systems disorder[s]” (Minshew and Goldstein, 1998), rather than disorders of focal brain regions. The search for autism endophenotypes in brain connectivity is a fledgling field. Early reports show altered functional connectivity in genetically high-risk infants (Orekhova et al., 2014; Righi et al., 2014; Keehn et al., 2015), and reduced white matter maturity in siblings of individuals with ASC (Lisiecka et al., 2015), but no study has previously examined a functional-connectivity endophenotype in adolescence.The current evidence for whole-brain connectivity differences between typically developing individuals and those with ASC is inconsistent (Barttfeld et al., 2011, 2012; Müller et al., 2011; Rudie et al., 2012; Vissers et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2014; Tyszka et al., 2014). This inconsistency may partly arise from heterogeneity of participants; both age (Sowell et al., 2003; Westlye et al., 2010; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011) and sex (Lai et al., 2012, 2013), for instance, are known to affect neuropathology in ASC, whilst intelligence is known to modulate several aspects of neurobiology, potentially including information transfer and connectivity (Luders et al., 2009; Neubauer and Fink, 2009). Studies investigating psychological or neurobiological processes in non-matched age, gender and IQ participants risk masking true differences or reporting false positives (Mottron, 2004). Other reasons for inconsistency may include the difficulty of comparing studies which explore connectivity in distinct task states. Such disparities represent an important anomaly to the notion of ASCs as \"developmental disconnection syndromes\" (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007).Here, we addressed the above limitations by testing whole-brain hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism in a gender-, age-, and IQ-matched sample of adolescents, at rest and across a range of tasks, thus simultaneously maximising sample homogeneity and task diversity. We employed complex network analysis (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) to characterise functional-MRI connectivity networks. This approach conceptualises neuroimaging data as a complex system of nodes (brain regions) and connections (interregional functional associations) and has successfully revealed organisational abnormalities in many severe psychiatric conditions but is a fledgling field in autism research (Menon, 2011; Rubinov and Bullmore, 2013). We have focused our analysis on description of whole-brain connectivity, but have also reported observed differences in local connectivity for completeness and for comparison with previous work.The strengths of our study for identification of whole-brain autism endophenotypes lie in the unique combination of a well matched sample of participants, the presence of unaffected siblings, the presence of multiple functional tasks and rest, and in whole-brain complex network analysis.2Materials and methods2.1ParticipantsWe analysed a matched group of 14 adolescent males with diagnosed ASC, 14 unaffected male siblings of individuals with ASC (henceforth “siblings”), and 14 typically-developing controls with no family history of ASC (Table 1), matched from a larger pool of 68 male and 60 female participants (Spencer et al., 2011; Spencer et al., 2012a, 2012b; Floris et al., 2013; Holt et al., 2014). All of the data and measures analysed in this study were collected in these previous works, the protocols for which were approved by the Cambridgeshire 1 Research Ethics Committee (National Health Service).As mentioned above, matching is crucial in autism research, given that individual differences in age, gender and IQ between participants can confound results. Our 14-participant groups were selected using an automated and unbiased matching algorithm (‘MATCH’) which minimised pairwise distances between participants in the normalised feature space (van Casteren and Davis, 2007). The numbers of participants in our study represent the maximal possible number with absent between-group differences in age, gender, and full-scale IQ (Wechsler, 1999). In addition, matching for full-scale IQ alone can leave discrepancies between ASC and typically-developing individuals in the subscales of verbal and nonverbal IQ (Jarrold and Brock, 2004), and our groups were in fact matched on all three measures. Diagnostic status of the ASC group was confirmed with the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) (Lord et al., 2000) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Le Couteur et al., 2003). Siblings and controls scored significantly lower in number of autistic traits as measured on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001b), and on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (Rutter et al., 2003), they scored below the cut-off that differentiates them from people with ASC. Siblings did not differ statistically from controls in these measures.The majority of siblings in our study (11/14) were not related to the participants with ASC: this largely avoids the potential confound introduced by shared environmental factors in the sibling and ASC groups (Cannon and Keller, 2006). None of the participants were currently or had previously taken psychotropic medication, though it was later revealed that one sibling had a diagnosis of resolved childhood epilepsy not initially reported during participant screening.2.2ProcedureThe data analysed here were collected by Spencer and colleagues, and the full details of the experimental tasks and the rationale for choosing them were published previously (Spencer et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Floris et al., 2013; Holt et al., 2014). Having completed the psychometric tests reported above, participants performed three short cognitive tasks (counterbalanced for order) during functional MRI recordings. Behavioural performance and group differences in brain activity during each task have been published in the above reports.One task (henceforth “Eyes task”) was adapted from the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” task (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001a), and simultaneously tested “theory of mind” and emotion recognition. Participants were presented with a pair of eyes and asked to either choose one of two mental state words to describe the expression of the eyes (mental state condition), or to decide whether the eyes were male or female (gender judgement condition); see Holt et al. (2014) for details.Another task involved detection of small component shapes within a complicated visual pattern, the so-called Embedded Figures task (henceforth “Figures task”: see Spencer et al., 2012b, for details) which has been popularly used in autism research and often demonstrates superior performance in people on the spectrum (Shah and Frith, 1983; Jolliffe and Baron-Cohen, 1997; Bölte and Poustka, 2006).Another task (henceforth “Ekman task”) used the Ekman (1975) pictures of facial affect, requiring participants to make judgements of gender on faces that were either happy, fearful or neutral and thus scrutinising the effects of emotion on cognitive processing (Spencer et al., 2011).Recordings were also taken of the cohort during ‘resting state’, a 7-minute period where participants were simply asked to close their eyes and think of nothing.2.3Imaging analysisFunctional and structural MRI scans were acquired on a Siemens Tim Trio 3-T system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (CBSU) in Cambridge, UK. In a sequence lasting 4 min and 32 s, MPRAGE structural images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2250 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, flip angle 9°, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm. Echoplanar (EPI) images during the functional tasks were acquired in a descending interleaved pattern with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle 78°, voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view = 192 × 192 mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix. 32 slices were acquired with a slice thickness of 3 mm and an inter-slice distance of 0.75 mm.The data preprocessing pipeline employed MRIcron (Rorden et al., 2007), AFNI (Cox, 1996) and FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012). The first five scans of each functional EPI series were discarded to ensure signal equilibration. Following skull-stripping, brain segmentation and non-linear registration to MNI space, anatomical images were co-registered with functional scans, which had been realigned and slice-time corrected. We extracted motion parameters using AFNI 3dvolreg and identified the mean contribution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter to the signal by creating trimmed (partial volume estimates >0.99) binary masks of both. We then regressed out these confounds, their derivatives, and quadratic terms (a total of 32 regressors, as described in Satterthwaite et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014), but not global signal (Gotts et al., 2013). We used AFNI's 3dBandpass command to despike each participant's time-series, apply an 0.01 Hz high-pass filter and an optional 0.1 Hz low-pass filter (see below for a discussion), regress the confounds and smooth the time-series with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.We parcellated the images using a parcellation scheme of 264 8 mm regions of interest (ROIs), split into 14 functional networks (Power et al., 2011): see Supplementary Materials, 1. Six ROIs were located outside of the brain in several participants, and were thus discarded. Using MATLAB, we calculated functional connectivity between these remaining 258 nodes using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We removed weak and potentially spurious correlations by preserving only the strongest 20% of connection weights for each participant, and analysing the resulting weighted matrices (Rubinov et al., 2009; van Wijk et al., 2010). This proportional thresholding represents the most popular approach in complex network analysis, and through normalising individual subject weight, emphasises differences in network topology, rather than differences in total connectivity. In this context, proportional thresholding can reduce and thus if anything underestimate any present between-group differences in total connectivity.In order to observe whether deviations in functional connectivity are task-dependent, we included cognitive tasks and resting state data in our analysis. Previous investigations of functional connectivity diverge in methods depending on whether they concern resting state or task-based data. So-called “intrinsic” functional connectivity reflects the low-frequency, spontaneous fluctuations in connectivity that appear during rest (Fox et al., 2007; Van Dijk et al., 2010). Autism researchers also frequently analysed functional connectivity during cognitive tasks, an approach henceforth described as “task-evoked” which often does not involve low-pass filtering, in order to emphasise task effects. Since previous studies have shown that the use of a low-pass filter substantially modulates findings in functional autism connectivity datasets (Jones et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2014), we completed analyses with and without low-pass filtering. Our main analyses included a low-pass filter, and are reported throughout the results section; additional analyses without low-pass filtering are reported and compared in Results 3.4.2.4Correction of movementMovement is a critical issue in functional connectivity as it can create artefacts of hypoconnectivity (Power et al., 2012, 2014, 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2012, 2013; van Dijk et al., 2012). The correction of movement artefact is a difficult problem without a clear consensus (Power et al., 2015); it is worth noting that whilst censoring of time-points has been prominently advocated as a solution (Power et al., 2013, 2014), this procedure has advantages and disadvantages, and does not represent an accepted gold standard (Beall and Lowe, 2014; Power et al., 2015).We performed several quality control checks to ensure that group differences did not reflect motion artefacts. Six location parameters were extracted from the scans of each participant for each slice during the scan time-series. We computed the mean framewise displacement (following Jenkinson et al., 2002; Power et al., 2012), as the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the translational and rotational realignment estimates (after converting rotational estimates to displacement at 50 mm radius), and averaged it to define mean motion for each participant over the whole scan. We also identified the maximum spike of movement (i.e. the largest difference in the location parameters between slices). We found no gross of movement of participants on visual inspection and consequent statistical analysis revealed that the groups did not differ significantly in mean motion (F(2, 41) = .925, p = .405) or in the number of movement spikes (F(2, 40) = 2.036, p = .145).To further investigate a possible influence of motion on our results, we computed, for each pair of nodes, the correlation between functional connectivity and maximum framewise displacement. Fig. 1, Part A shows the moving average of these correlations as a function of Euclidean distance between nodes, for a “null-hypothesis” pipeline with only CSF and white-matter but no motion correction, and for our full preprocessing pipeline. In the absence of a movement artefact we would expect the correlations to be around zero. In the presence of an artefact we would expect higher correlations for short-distance node pairs and lower correlations for long-distance node pairs (Power et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014). To assess the magnitude of the correlations, we performed the same computations after permuting the framewise displacement values for the participants 100 times, thus generating the distribution of values to be expected when no relationship between motion and functional connectivity exists (the grey lines of Fig. 1A and 1B). We then tested, for both pipelines, if the overall mean correlation or the distance dependence is significantly different from those observed in the permutations. The overall mean correlation was not significantly different from the null distribution for both pipelines (p > 0.1), but we found that the slope of a straight line fitted through the correlation values at a steeper angle for the simple pipeline (slope: −0.6/m, p value < 0.01), where it was almost flat for our full pipeline (slope: −0.5/m, p value 0.1). This is consistent with a possibly artefactual relationship between movement and distance dependence in the data, which is largely corrected for by our pipeline. The use of maximum framewise displacement is a more stringent test for motion corruption that has been omitted in previous studies (which typically used mean framewise displacement). When we examined the relationship between motion and mean framewise displacement (Fig. 1B), the effect size of the distance-dependent artefact was negligible.Finally, we examined the correlation between mean movement and maximum movement (spike) parameters and global functional connectivity in each task. Global functional connectivity did not correlate with movement spikes, but did correlate with mean movement in the Figure (r = .339, p = .030), Ekman (r = .348, p = .026) and Eyes (r = .412, p = .007) tasks. Positive correlations between functional connectivity and average movement (see Fig. 1C) reflected that participants who moved more tended to have higher functional connectivity. This bolsters the interpretation of genuine hypoconnectivity in the ASC group rather than artefactual hypoconnectivity resulting from greater movement.Important recent work suggests that that movement may also represent a biological, in addition to artefactual, correlate of dysconnectivity (Zeng et al., 2014) In this context, we did not regress group-average motion estimates in our analysis to avoid removal of important biological effects which are correlated with, but do not arise as a result of, varying levels of motion.2.5Statistical analysis of endophenotypes in functional connectivityThe central tenets of the endophenotype concept (Gottesman and Gould, 2003) suggest that if disrupted connectivity were present as an endophenotype of autism, we would predict differences between autistic participants and controls, and between siblings and controls. Significant difference between affected individuals and their genetic relatives are of interest but not strictly necessary for identification of endophenotypes, so we do not include them. For each variable in the forthcoming analysis, we therefore employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify group differences and followed this with t-tests comparing siblings and controls and comparing participants with ASC and controls. In all cases, we used the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Given the novel and exploratory nature of this investigation, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.We analysed global network organisation with four measures:Whole-brain functional connectivity: We examined connection strengths in weighted matrices (pairwise correlations between 258 brain regions), searching for group differences when collapsing all tasks. Many studies of functional connectivity have taken an a priori approach focusing on certain ROIs. Whilst this is certainly a valid approach based on an abundance of previous literature, results from these analyses have been somewhat inconsistent (Müller et al., 2011). In this context, we focused on a potentially more robust data-driven whole-brain analysis.Clustering coefficient (C): C quantifies the number of connections between a node's nearest neighbours and reflects the density of edges (connections) in a node's immediate neighbourhood (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010: see paper for details). To ensure that C in each participant differed from that which would be expected by chance and degree distribution alone, for each participant we divided the value of C by the mean value of C obtained from an ensemble of 100 random networks with the same size, density, degree and strength distribution of the participant template on which they were based (Rubinov and Sporns, 2011).Global efficiency (E): E is defined as the average inverse shortest path length – the minimal number of edges (or ‘steps’) – between all pairs of nodes. The greater the path length of a network, the less efficient it is (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012) (see Rubinov and Sporns, 2010, for details). We normalised E as above.Node disruption index: We examined the extent to which autistic and sibling participants differed from controls in node characteristics, using the measure of node disruption index (NDI: originally termed “hub disruption index”) (Achard et al., 2012). First, the total weight of connections (strength) was calculated for each node, and averaged over the control group. For each participant, these average nodal strengths were then subtracted from individual nodal strengths. The NDI is the slope of these differences against the average values over the control group, and represents the similarity of nodal properties to the average of nodal properties of the typical participant (see Supplementary Materials 2 and 3 for details and additional analyses).Local measures: We analysed local differences in functional connectivity by examining the location of the most highly-connected nodes (“hubs”), defined as the 20% of nodes with highest total connection weight. The distribution of these hubs was explored in 9 of the 14 functional networks, namely the cerebellar, cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal task control, default mode, dorsal and ventral attention, salience, subcortical and visual networks. We excluded three networks irrelevant to the nature of our tasks (the auditory network and two sensorimotor networks), and two functionally imprecise networks (see Supplementary Material 1, for details). Having identified the network identity of hubs in each group, we searched for differences in the distribution of hubs between ASC, sibling and control participants by tallying, in each participant, the number of hubs in each of network. As before, ANOVAs were first conducted followed by t-test comparisons of ASC vs. controls and siblings vs. controls. We ensured the robustness of these results with additional analyses, including an alternative method of hub selection and an analysis of interregional and intranetwork connections (see Supplementary Material 4).3Results3.1Global differences: functional connectivityIn initial analysis of average connection weights between 258 brain nodes, we observed a significant effect of group with the inclusion of all four task conditions (F[1, 39] = 4.082, p = .025), reflecting differences in group connectivity averaged across all tasks. Fig. 2A illustrates that the control group showed the strongest global connectivity and the ASC group the weakest, with siblings intermediate. One-way ANOVAs of each task condition individually showed significant group differences in connection weights in the Figures task (F[2, 41] = 4.003, p = .026: Fig. 2B) and during resting-state (F[2, 41] = 4.221, p = .022: Fig. 2C), and a non-significant trend in the same direction (p = .118: Fig. 2D) in the Ekman task. There was no significant trend effect in the Eyes task (Fig. 2E); on post-hoc consideration, this could reflect issues around the nature of this task, which conflated mentalising conditions and gender-judgement conditions such as to be a non-specific task of ‘active cognitive processing’. For this reason, we focus on the more easily interpretable task states for the remainder of the paper, but report analysis of the Eyes task in Supplementary Materials (5) for completeness and transparency.Strongly significant correlations (each with a p-value lower than .01) were seen between connectivity in each of the conditions (see Supplementary Materials, 6). This reflected the fact that individuals showed differences in connectivity across the board rather than in any one task, which explains the main effect of Group when all tasks were collapsed (Fig. 2A). Individuals with lower connectivity tended to be those with ASC and, to a lesser extent, siblings.The difference between control and ASC participants was significant in the Figure (t[26] = 3.291, p = .003) and Ekman tasks (t[26] = 2.270, p = .032) and during rest (t[26] = 3.427, p = .002), and ASC participants showed significantly lower whole-brain connectivity than controls when all tasks were collapsed (t[26] = 2.748, p = .011). T-tests found no significant differences between siblings and control participants in any task condition (p > .3 for each tasks; although p = .072 across all tasks, see Fig. 2, Panel A). Panels A and B suggest that siblings are more similar to the ASC group in the strength of functional connectivity (see Fig. 3 for an alternative representation).Significant endophenotype effects appeared in the non-normalised clustering coefficient (C) and global efficiency (E) in the Figures task, the Ekman task and during rest, reflecting differences between control, sibling and ASC participants in global network organisation. These were not significant when normalised by reference null models (Supplementary Materials, 7).3.2Global differences: network organisationThe similarity between autistic and sibling participants was further evident in node disruption index (NDI). Scores closest to zero reflect similarity to nodal strength in the typical brain (Fig. 4), and the three groups differed significantly in the Figures task (F[2, 41] = 5.322, p = .009), the Ekman task (F[2, 41] = 4.422, p = .019), and during rest (F[2, 41] = 5.452, p = .008). Siblings and control participants differed significantly in the Figures task (t[26] = 2.226, p = .035) and during rest (t[26] = 2.491, p = .019); the other comparison relevant for endophenotypes, that of ASC vs. controls, was also significant in the Figures task (t[26] = 3.354, p = .002), the Ekman task (t[26] = 3.061, p = .005) and during rest (t[26] = 3.458, p = .002).This measure reflects homogeneity within the control group, given that NDI scores were significantly closer to zero in individual control participants than in individuals in the ASC or the sibling group. Control participants would, however, be naturally expected to resemble the template computed from their group average strength. Therefore, to examine the homogeneity of the ASC and sibling groups themselves, we computed deviance from average nodal strength when the ASC or sibling group were used as an average. Whilst individual controls were close to an average control template of node strength, siblings and participants with ASC were no closer to their group's average nodal strength than were the other groups: no group differences were seen in any task, reflecting greater heterogeneity in ASC and sibling groups than in control participants. We report this fully in Supplementary Materials (3).3.3Local changes in network topographyWe examined the presence of localised changes in connection differences by considering the distribution of hub nodes in individual brain networks, defined by our 258-node parcellation scheme.The topography of hubs differed substantially in the Figure and Ekman tasks. Two patterns emerged during the Figures task (Fig. 5A). Group differences characterised by low number of hubs in controls and high number of hubs in ASC appeared in the cerebellar network (F[2, 41] = 8.048, p = .001) and the visual network (F[2, 41] = 4.379, p = .019), with siblings intermediate in both. In direct comparisons, siblings differed statistically from controls only in the visual network (t[26] = 2.421, p = .023); ASC and control participants also differed significantly in the visual network (t[26] = 2.931, p = .007), reflecting a true endophenotype effect. ASC participants also differed from controls with more hubs in the cerebellar network (t[26] = 3.432, p = .002), but the siblings did not differ significantly from the controls.A reversed endophenotype effect, with autistic participants showing the fewest hubs and controls the most, was evident in the subcortical network (F[2, 41] = 3.672, p = .035) and was marginally non-significant in the default mode network (DMN) (F[2, 41] = 3.095, p = .057). T-tests between siblings and controls were not significant in either case, though controls and ASC participants differed significantly in the number of hubs in the subcortical (t[26] = 2.895, p = .008) and default mode (t[26] = 2.721, p = .011) networks.Finally, non-endophenotype (non-linear) effects were observed in the ventral attention network (ASC participants showed the fewest hubs and siblings the most, F [2, 41 = 5.594, p = .007); and in the cingulo-opercular task control network ASC participants showed the most hubs and siblings the fewest, F[2, 41] = 3.450, p = .042). No t-test comparisons were significant.We confirmed all of these group differences using an alternative method of hub definition and further tests of local network connection weights. In this case, the group difference in the DMN, which was previously marginally non-significant, became significant and showed a strong endophenotype effect in intra-network and interregional connection weights (Supplementary Materials, 8).Trends that were non-significant in the Figures task became significant during the Ekman task (Fig. 5B): autistic participants showed the fewest hubs and controls the most in the DMN (F[2, 41] = 6.381, p = .004). In contrast, control participants had the fewest hubs and ASC participants the most in the dorsal attention network (F[2, 41] = 5.746, p = .006). In both cases, siblings were intermediate but significantly different from controls in both the DMN (t[26] = 2.796, p = .010) and the dorsal attention network (t[26] = 2.823, p = .009): autistic participants also differed from controls in the number of hubs in the DMN (t[26] = 3.441, p = .002) and the dorsal attention network (t[26] = 3.121, p = .004). The reverse trend, with the greatest number of nodes in the ASC group and the fewest in the control group, was seen in the visual network with a group difference (F[2, 41] = 5.530, p = .008). T-tests did not however find this difference to be significant between siblings and controls.Finally, a non-endophenotype effect was seen in the cingulo-opercular task control network, where siblings showed the greatest number of high-strength nodes and controls the fewest (F[2, 41] = 3.522, p = .039).These differences remained significant with an alternative method of hub definition and in an analysis of interregional and intra-network connectivity (Supplementary Materials, 9).3.4The effect of low-pass filteringThe use of a low-pass filter has been shown to substantially influence results in autism neuroimaging (Jones et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2014). To check the robustness of our findings, we re-analysed our data without a low-pass filter. As a whole, our results remained consistent between these two preprocessing strategies, with no trend reversals and most, but not all, tests remaining significant. A full comparison of these two preprocessing strategies is in Supplementary Materials (10), and the main changes are as follows. In our analysis of correlation coefficients reflecting whole brain connectivity, t-tests showed that the comparison of connectivity between controls and ASC participants in the Ekman task became non-significant (t[26] = 1.790, p = .085); in contrast, a new significant difference now emerged between controls and siblings in resting state (t[26] = 2.257, p = .033). This, along with the difference between controls and ASC in resting state, would implicate hypoconnectivity during rest as a particular endophenotype in accordance with the criteria we adopted (see Materials and methods section, Section 2.4). In our analysis of node disruption index (NDI), the same trends remained but the group effects in the Figures task (F[2, 41] = 2.496, p = .095) and the Ekman task (F[2, 41] = 2.493, p = .096) dropped below significance, as did the contrast between controls and ASC participants (t[6] = 1.645, p = .112) and controls and siblings (t[26] = 1.975, p = .059) in the Figures task. Whilst this endophenotype did not therefore remain significant, NDI remained significantly different and an endophenotype effect remained in resting state. In the Figures task, group differences in the subcortical network and cingulo-opercular task control network became non-significant, but previously marginal group differences in the DMN (p = .057) became significant (F[2, 41] = 4.207, p = .022). In t-tests, the difference between controls and ASC participants in the subcortical network became marginally non-significant (t[26] = 1.963, p = .060), as did the difference between siblings and controls in visual network (t[26] = 1.960, p = .061). All local differences in the Ekman task remained significant.4DiscussionWe explored whole-brain and local connectivity endophenotypes in a well-matched cohort of participants with ASC, unaffected siblings, and typically developing controls, and observed a robust whole-brain connectivity endophenotype effect in the Embedded Figures task, the Ekman task, and resting state. This was confirmed by several strands of analysis and with differences in preprocessing (see Supplementary Materials, 10). Primarily, we observed reduced correlation between brain regions across all tasks (and across some tasks individually): connection weights between regions were weakest in ASC, intermediate in siblings, and strongest in controls. Further analyses of strength similarity to typical brain connectivity, using the node disruption index (NDI), confirmed that both autistic and sibling participants deviated significantly from the average density of node connections as shown in the group of typically-developing adolescent boys — an effect which was present in all four conditions. Autistic and sibling participants did not differ significantly from each other in any task and were more heterogeneous, lacking the more similar node structure that made individual control participants close to their group mean in nodal strength. This heterogeneity or idiosyncrasy in the autistic brain extends the recent findings of Hahamy et al. (2015) by showing the genetic heritability underlying such idiosyncrasy.Brain endophenotypes in the relatives of people with autism have been reported previously (Dawson et al., 2005; Baron-Cohen et al., 2006), including in studies which have analysed less stringently matched supersets of the current participant cohort (Spencer et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Holt et al., 2014). These previous investigations reported localised changes in haemodynamic response (blood-oxygen level dependent: BOLD) to stimuli in task conditions. Analysis of functional connectivity endophenotypes in adolescent autism is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Differences in functional connectivity may explain previously reported abnormalities in localised BOLD signal. For instance, abnormal functional connectivity may make it difficult to regulate and reduce brain activity (Spencer et al., 2012a), and may additionally underlie regional hypoactivity associated with autistic symptoms (Spencer et al., 2011, 2012b).Functional hypoconnectivity might be interpreted as consistent, at a theoretical level, with the well-established weak central coherence account (Happé and Frith, 2006). Weak central coherence describes the tendency of people with ASC, their relatives (Briskman et al., 2001) and people with autistic traits (Best et al., 2008) to process data in a piecemeal fashion, biased towards local processing and often failing to process things in a global manner or to see the ‘bigger picture’. Just and colleagues (Just et al., 2012) link this and other autistic features to a disruption in the integrated activity of distributed brain regions underlying complex cognitive tasks. Of course, support for this theory rests on the assumption that the observed functional connectivity directly underlies integration and cognitive function, and the behavioural correlate of hypoconnectivity is far from transparent. For instance, despite the robust observed functional-connectivity effect, we did not observe a behavioural difference between siblings and controls in the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) or the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). This may be due to the small size of our sample: previous studies demonstrating the heritability of the AQ have contained hundreds if not thousands of participants (Hoekstra et al., 2007; Ruzich et al., 2015). It is possible that behavioural tasks require more statistical power to detect an effect, whereas functional connectivity differences are more easily detected.The existence of a whole-brain endophenotype in our dataset supports previous reports for heritability of functional connectivity (Posthuma et al., 2005; Smit et al., 2008; Schutte et al., 2013). Although where possible we avoided related ASC and sibling participants, it is impossible to completely disentangle genetic and environmental influences on the endophenotype, given that our unaffected siblings did live with their own autistic siblings. Gerdts et al. (2013), however, convincingly show a genetic continuum in the endophenotype with a comparison of families with one autistic child (simplex families) and families with multiple autistic children (multiplex families): the latter exhibit more restricted interests and repetitive behaviour and are less social, less likely to smile and to make eye-contact than participants from simplex families. Our analysis provides further biological evidence of inherited autistic features in the brain and may highlight genes involved in neural transmission as loci of interest.4.1Localisation of brain differencesThe major focus of our analysis was on whole brain measures of connectivity. Analysis of hub topography revealed, however, that certain networks may be particularly compromised in siblings as well as individuals with autism. We mention several of these in light of their theoretical relationship to ASC.During the Figures task, the cerebellar and visual networks had the greatest number of hubs in ASC and the fewest hubs in control participants. This appeared as an endophenotype effect in our primary analysis, although it lost significance when the low-pass filter was removed. The trend stayed consistent, however, and so this result may still be of interest, particularly for its consistency with previous research in autism. A greater number of high-strength nodes present in visual systems could be theoretically consistent with the strengths that both people with ASC and genetic relations exhibit in piecemeal processing (Baron-Cohen and Hammer, 1997; Bölte and Poustka, 2006). It is consistent, too, with previous reports of temporo-occipital and occipital hyperconnectivity reported in children and adolescents with ASC (Keehn et al., 2013; Keown et al., 2013). There has been suggestion that people with ASC show weaker connections between anterior and posterior brain regions (Just et al., 2004, 2007; Koshino et al., 2005; Kana et al., 2009; Damarla et al., 2010). We confirmed this difference in some of our confirmatory tests (see Supplementary Materials, 8). A more rigorous, focal investigation of connectivity in and involving the visual network in relatives could be a target for future research.The most consistent effect in both the Ekman and the Figures task was found in the default mode network (DMN), where controls showed the greatest number, and autistics the fewest number, of high-strength hubs. This group effect was marginally non-significant with a low-pass filter (p = .057), but became significant without a low-pass filter (p = .022). Closer scrutiny of this finding (see Supplementary Materials, 9 and 10) confirmed that connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and the rest of the brain was significantly weaker in autism and significantly weaker in siblings than matched controls, in both of these tasks. Components of the DMN decrease their activity during overt cognitive processing (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001) and increase activity in ‘mind-wandering’ states (Greicius et al., 2003) and during tasks involving aspects of social cognition and mentalising (Schilbach et al., 2008; Lombardo et al., 2010; Mars et al., 2012). This does not appear to be the case in individuals with ASC (Kennedy et al., 2006). Consistent with their archetypal impairments in social cognition, functional hypoconnectivity of the DMN is a consistent finding in ASC (Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008; Assaf et al., 2010; Paakki et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2010; von dem Hagen et al., 2013; although see Lynch et al., 2013 and Redcay et al., 2013 for a divergent viewpoint). Our finding of DMN hypoconnectivity thus supports the notion that differences in DMN connectivity constitute a local endophenotype of autism in adolescence.As we clustered individual regions together in functional networks, there may be additional local differences in connectivity (for e.g., see Keehn et al., 2013; Keown et al., 2013; Fishman et al., 2014) which were not detected by our analysis. We and others (Just et al., 2012) draw a tentative link between local connectivity of the visual system and visual processing strengths of ASC and genetic relatives, but pockets of hyperconnectivity in the brain may be as detrimental as hypoconnectivity to behaviour and function. This is evidenced in the relationship between hyperconnectivity and symptom severity or behavioural impairment (Mostofsky et al., 2007; Redcay et al., 2013; Supekar et al., 2013; Fishman et al., 2014). The mechanisms through which hyperconnectivity might result in functional impairment have been well discussed by several authors (Belmonte et al., 2004a; Courchesne and Pierce, 2005; Happé and Frith, 2006; Markram and Markram, 2010).4.2Strengths, limitations and future directionsMany previous reports of atypical connectivity in ASC have been localised to specific regions, and were potentially sensitive to methodological decisions (Jones et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2014); the multitude of differential approaches have made studies difficult to reproduce (Müller et al., 2011). Our finding of a whole-brain endophenotype in adolescents addresses previous questions about the whole-brain nature of autism connectivity abnormalities (Barttfeld et al., 2011, 2012; Rudie et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2014; Tyszka et al., 2014) and is backed up by other approaches such as ICA which have also reported whole-brain ASC hypoconnectivity (Mueller et al., 2013; von dem Hagen et al., 2013). We performed analyses with and without a low-pass filter for rest and all task conditions so to observe any potential changes with use of this filter (Jones et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2014). The consistency that we observed between our primary results and those obtained by this secondary task-evoked approach suggests that our results are largely robust to this processing step. However, notably, whilst all the trends persisted, some findings, like node disruption index (NDI), became non-significant and must therefore be interpreted cautiously.The benefit of high n must be balanced with the genuine problem of group heterogeneity in autism research. We prioritised the reduction of group heterogeneity by stringently matching participants on age, sex and IQ at the expense of reduced n. This reduction of individual differences which could modulate connectivity increased the likelihood that the observed effect is real. This is, however, an exploratory study with no correction for multiple comparisons, and replication of these findings on a larger scale is necessary to validate the putative endophenotype that we report (Button et al., 2013). It is notable that previous connectivity work on “high-risk” infant siblings and adult relatives focused on mixed samples (Orekhova et al., 2014; Keehn et al., 2015) and some authors did not consider gender as a factor (Buard et al., 2013; Righi et al., 2014). Matching participants by sex is the currently recommended approach given that females with autism may not share the same neurobiological abnormalities as males (Lai et al., 2012, 2013). As such, the integrity of functional connectivity in females with ASC and their siblings remains to be elucidated, particularly in light of evidence suggesting that sex may modulate the presentation of behavioural endophenotypes of ASC (Sucksmith et al., 2013; Klusek et al., 2014).Our analysis deals with a narrow time-window of adolescence and may not be generalisable to (male) ASC at all ages. Our findings contribute to a large pool of studies reporting hypoconnectivity in ASC. However, it is notable that a minority of studies have also reported functional and anatomical hyper-connectivity (Vissers et al., 2012; Supekar et al., 2013; Uddin et al., 2013). These findings may, in part, reflect the different ages of studied subjects (Nomi and Uddin, 2015). Findings of hyperconnectivity in ASC have been commonly associated with early life, where autistic children often exhibit brain hypertrophy (Courchesne and Pierce, 2005) which plateaus in childhood and may reverse by adolescence, with hypoconnectivity then becoming the dominant finding (Uddin et al., 2013). More recent work emphasised the developmental modulation of functional connectivity (Nomi and Uddin, 2015): their adolescent sample, like ours, showed between-network hypoconnectivity that appeared normalised in comparison to typically-developed controls in adulthood, which may explain null findings by some groups (Tyszka et al., 2014). The authors confirmed the previous suggestion of within-network hyperconnectivity in children, although hypoconnectivity between networks was also a feature of childhood ASC. In light of this, we restrict our interpretations to adolescence, and further work is needed to characterise the developmental course of functional connectivity in ASC and genetic relatives.Movement noise is an important issue of concern in analyses of functional connectivity, as it may create artefacts of hypoconnectivity (Power et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 2012; van Dijk et al., 2012). Our analysis pipeline involved regression of 32 noise variables (Satterthwaite et al., 2012), filtering and despiking. We conducted several checks which suggest that our approach adequately controlled for movement artefact. Our data speaks against an interpretation of hypoconnectivity caused by artefacts: correlations between global functional connectivity and movement parameters reflected that most participants were clustered together as “low movers” and the few who moved more (in the ASC and sibling groups) actually tended to show higher rather than lower connectivity.Our analysis found differences in absolute but not normalised clustering coefficient (C) or global efficiency (E) in any of the four conditions. These results replicate the previous findings of Barttfeld et al. (2011, 2012), who found significantly lower non-normalised C during resting state and an auditory oddball task, and of Rudie et al. (2013) who found significantly lower non-normalised C in ASC during resting state, and a trend in the same direction for normalised C (neither group used our measure of efficiency). Together these findings suggest that changes in clustering coefficient are primarily driven by the propensity for reduction in whole-brain network connectivity, rather than by more subtle network reconfiguration. They again corroborate the fact evident from the other data in our report: despite lacking a diagnosis of autism, genetically-related but otherwise typically developing siblings of people with autism differ quantitatively from unrelated members of the public.We finally comment on the implications and further directions arising from our use of several tasks. The robustness of the hypoconnectivity endophenotype across several functional contexts (two cognitive tasks and resting state) and the overall consistency of findings with or without low-pass filtering make the findings robust. Such robustness is also in-line with recent evidence suggesting the broad convergence and similarity of large-scale whole-brain functional connectivity maps at rest and across multiple tasks (Cole et al., 2014), and is shown in the correlations we saw between connectivity in each condition, including the Eyes task (Supplementary Materials, 6). However we cannot claim that hypoconnectivity is state-independent, given our failure to find the endophenotype effect in the Eyes task. We note, however, that endophenotypes have been seen in this task before (Holt et al., 2014) and are not contradicted by the present findings (see Supplementary Materials, 5). Future studies need to clarify the clinical utility of hypoconnectivity by searching for the specificity and positive predictive values of such endophenotypes (Rubinov and Bullmore, 2013). Given the diverse presentations of ASC and their polygenic aetiology, the identification of features specific to diagnosed individuals and their relatives on the broader autism spectrum may clarify the mechanisms underlying ASC, and the search for specific genes and targeted interventions.5ConclusionIn summary, this multitask investigation compared well-matched adolescent groups of male autistic participants, unaffected siblings and typically developing controls to show that siblings of people with autism differ significantly from typically-developing controls in neural connectivity and measures of network density. This was evident during two cognitive tasks (most particularly the Embedded Figures task) and during rest, and constitutes an endophenotype of autism in these matched adolescent participants. Our analysis revealed that brain connectivity in siblings was more similar to that of participants with ASC in presentation, which may underlie the behavioural similarities between these groups. As hypoconnectivity seems to be shared by individuals with genes conferring vulnerability for autism, it may be an endophenotype which lends weight to previous suggestions that ASCs arise from dysfunction of neural connectivity.ReferencesAchardS.Delon-MartinC.VértesP.E.RenardF.SchenckM.SchneiderF.HeinrichC.KremerS.BullmoreE.T.Hubs of brain functional networks are radically reorganized in comatose patientsProc.

The bold red lines reflects values from actual data, whilst straight red lines are fitted linear functions: grey lines are obtained by permuting movement values for participants. (C) Correlations between average movement and functional connectivity in each task. As can be seen, most participants are clustered together with low average movement. The few outliers who moved most belonged to the ASC (stars) and sibling (triangle) groups and appear to be consistent across each task, but these participants in fact tend to show higher functional connectivity.Fig. 2Average connection weights (correlation coefficients) computed from weighted matrices for each group during each task condition. Error bars represent standard deviation. Asterisks reflect significant (p < .05) group differences in ANOVAs: as can be seen, these emerged for all four conditions together and during the Figures task and resting state alone. The group difference was non-significant in the Ekman task.Fig. 3Difference matrices produced by subtracting the connection weights of one group from another. The 258 × 258 matrices reflect the edges (connections) between 258 brain nodes. White voxels reflect connections where groups do not differ in connection weights. Red voxels represent connections which are stronger in the first group than the second (controls > ASC; controls > siblings; siblings > ASC). Blue voxels represent connections which are stronger in the second group than the first (ASC > controls; siblings > controls; ASC > siblings).Fig. 4Mean node disruption index (NDI) for each group in each task with standard deviation in error bars. In each task, the mean NDI of control participants close to zero reflected that with little variance, each tended to resemble the group average in nodal strength. Mean NDIs further away from zero reflected deviance from typical node structure in the autistic and sibling groups.

The emerging field of “immuno-psychiatry” has the potential to widen the exploration of a mechanism-based nosology, possibly leading to the discovery of more effective personalised treatment strategies.DiscussionDisturbances in immuno-inflammatory and related systems have been implicated in the aetiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology and comorbidity of several psychiatric disorders, including major mood disorders and schizophrenia. A fundamental challenge in their clinical management is to identify bio-signatures that might indicate risk, state, trait, prognosis or theragnosis. Here, we provide the rationale for a clinical and research agenda to refine future clinical practice and conceptual views, and to delineate pathways toward innovative treatment discovery.ConclusionThe development of bio-signatures will allow clinicians to tailor interventions to the abovementioned biomarker subtypes – a major translational goal for research in this field.KeywordsPersonalised psychiatryImmune inflammationBiomarkersBiological pathwaysTranslational researchissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2016BackgroundDespite increasing scientific knowledge and enormous efforts to classify psychiatric disorders, this field is currently limited by the absence of an articulated neurobiological substrate to delineate valid diagnostic entities, inhibiting the development of timely, explanatory, mechanism-based therapeutic strategies. Further, this constitutes a major driver for the failure to discover novel therapies for those with neuropsychiatric disorders [1]. Current diagnostic schemes for psychiatric disorders are based on descriptive nomenclature given the absence of clearly defined causal mechanisms. Such descriptive nomenclature does not easily include the multiple and successively occurring psychiatric and medical comorbidities, nor the considerable diagnostic instability demonstrated in longitudinal studies.Disturbances in the immuno-inflammatory system have been implicated in the aetiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology and comorbidity of several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major mood disorders, suicidal behaviour, post-traumatic disorder and autism [2, 3]. Inflammation and activated cell-mediated immune pathways have consistently been found in diverse patient cohorts indexed by an up-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [4, 5], triggered and sustained by environmental risk factors such as very early infections [6], severe childhood trauma [7] or lifelong psychosocial stressors [8]. It is noteworthy that inflammatory biomarkers overlap with risk pathways for medical disorders commonly comorbid with psychiatric disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis [9]. In this context, the emerging field of “immuno-psychiatry” has the potential to widen the exploration of a mechanism-based nosology, possibly leading to the discovery of more effective personalised treatment strategies. Herein, we provide the rationale for a research agenda to refine clinical practice, including the description of steps to define the basis of an immuno-psychiatry-based nosology, as well as pathways toward innovative treatment discovery. We describe putative research areas and delineate, for each of them, the current evidence, associated obstacles and research strategies to inform treatment decisions and to build an agenda for treatment discovery.Diagnosis in psychiatry is still restricted to symptoms and observable signs given the lack of valid biomarkers. Most biomarker candidates show insufficient sensitivity and specificity within disorders and overlap greatly between disorders [10]. Furthermore, diagnostic classification does not consider the medical and psychiatric comorbidities nor the lifetime staging processes [11]. Therefore, efforts to reformulate DSM-5 and ICD-11 nosology should be developed through careful exploration of possible mechanisms (e.g. dimensions, categories, environmental risk factors and/or biological markers) and should lead to, and ultimately be validated by, insightful and targeted therapeutic strategies. Along the same line, primary prevention strategies based on the identification of modifiable environmental risk factors associated with inflammation need to be conceptualised [2]. It is known that many of the known risk factors for disorders are indeed transduced via inflammatory and related pathways such as redox biology [2]. Indeed, we would argue for a common framework of conceptualised psychiatric disorders among the disproportionally comorbid non-communicable medical disorders because of shared antecedent risks and common biomarkers. This framework suggests and, as we will later illustrate, shows evidence for common treatment and preventive strategies. Linking cross-clinical dimensional symptomatology with epidemiological and biological observations may help refine meaningful new subgroups using environmental risk factors, such as infections or stress, to assess medical comorbid disorders and immune phenotypes to inform treatment.Auto-immunity, early infection and immune-genetic background: characterisation for prevention?Autoimmune diseases and early infections are well-known to increase the risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, autism spectrum disorders or schizophrenia [3, 12, 13]. For instance, a history of hospitalisation for infection is known to increase the risk of later mood disorders by 45 %, while prior history of auto-immune disorders and infections interact in synergy to further raise the risk of subsequent mood disorders by more than 60 % [14]. Maternal history of auto-immune disorders is also associated with an increased risk of subsequent autism spectrum disorders in offspring of more than 40 % [15], whereas maternal infections requiring hospitalisation have been reported in autism spectrum disorders [16]. Auto-immunity in schizophrenia, affective psychosis and bipolar disorder has also been reported [17], thus clearly crossing classical diagnostic boundaries [6]. Cognitive decline and brain imaging abnormalities have also been associated with prenatal infections and/or elevated cytokine levels across disorders [18].How to translate these findings into an agenda? Not all subjects that experience early life infection develop psychiatric disorders. Environmental factors, such as early infection, could predispose to autoimmune disturbances in immunogenetically vulnerable individuals. A relevant validation strategy would thus be to search for associations between immunogenetic variants and life infection history. In animal models, for instance, transgenic mice displaying a genetic predisposition to autism exhibit enhanced responses to environmental challenges to maternal immune activation [19]. In humans, the major histocompatibility complex region that includes the human leukocyte (HLA) genes locus, which has a crucial role in initiating cellular and humoral immune responses as well as vulnerability to autoimmune disorders, appears as a major candidate to identify at-risk subjects. Several HLA genes and haplotypes are linked to autism [13], while HLA polymorphisms are amongst the most associated region in schizophrenia [20]. Furthermore, an association between bipolar patients with autoimmune comorbid disorders and genes encoding functional Toll Like Receptors (innate immunity) has been reported [21]. Strengthening the exploration of immunogenetic diversity in major psychiatric disorders, such as innate, adaptive immunity and inflammation pathways, is urgently needed as has been performed for cancer [22]. It is necessary to further test gene–gene interactions between risk pathways and the immune and synaptic pathways as demonstrated in autism [23] and schizophrenia [24]. This will permit identification of at-risk individuals and their follow-up along the developmental exposure to various infections and other environmental risk factors, additionally suggesting developmental pathways for novel therapeutic strategies.Developmental stress: another factor for resilience/susceptibility to mental disorders?Besides the impact of early infections/autoimmune disorders in genetically sensitive subjects, a second “hit”, such as postnatal stress, also predisposes these individuals to physiological abnormalities mediated by prenatal immune activation. Indeed, early exposure to trauma in childhood can increase the subsequent risk of poor functioning of the immune and endocrine systems, which could constitute risk factors for later depression [7]. Early life stress in humans has been implicated in many psychiatric disorders in adult life, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, as well as somatic illnesses ranging from cardiovascular illness and diabetes to alterations at all levels of the brain–gut axis such as the altered balance of enteric microflora [25]. Early life stress is also known to induce long-term alterations in inflammatory responses, including elevated C-reactive-protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, Th1-like) [26]. Bipolar patients with a history of childhood trauma have a more severe form of illness characterised by earlier age at onset, suicide attempts, rapid cycling, an increased number of depressive episodes, and higher levels of inflammatory markers [27]. Adult vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases can thus be conceived as being imprinted during foetal and early postnatal periods through genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms [28]. It must be noted at this juncture that immune regulatory pathways do not operate singularly, but form part of a complex interacting network with other pathways, including, but not limited to, redox, neurogenesis/apoptosis, mitochondrial function and other stress response pathways [29].How to translate these findings into an agenda? A subgroup defined by history of severe and early stress could be identified by psychological and biological signatures associating, for instance, elevated levels of cytokines, cortisol and oxidative stress with specific clinical characteristics. These could be further refined by developmental animal models in which the phenotypic target of the pre/postnatal stress model, e.g. specific molecular, behavioural or cognitive deficit [30, 31], higher susceptibility to environmental challenges, or altered impact on risk and vulnerability pathways [32], will be defined. Life stressors are likely to occur at different periods, with different origins and intensities, and their impact could also be tested in these animal models. Furthermore, developmental stress implicates biological mechanisms in which numerous bodily systems, both peripheral and central, are engaged. Monitoring these parameters in classical pre/postnatal stress models and testing the resistance to stress after manipulations of these parameters will shed new light on how environmental challenges early in life may or may not alter resilience and vulnerability pathways. Finally, at-risk subjects exposed to early and/or chronic stressors could also be identified by their immunogenetic markers as known factors for higher risk of psychiatric disorders (see above). Collectively, we advocate herein that early identification of “high at-risk” subjects who underwent severe stress events during childhood will thus open the possibility of prevention strategies based on changeable environmental risk factors and restored balance in key biological systems.Medical comorbidities in major psychiatric disorders: more than a coincidence?Comorbidity between psychiatric and medical disorders is a major issue as it is estimated that approximately 70–90 % of individuals with bipolar disorder experience a concomitant psychiatric or somatic disorder [33]. Compared to the general population, metabolic syndrome is twice more common in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [34]. Further, an array of disorders is more commonly comorbid with depression (e.g. atopy, cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis and diabetes). Unsurprisingly, they all share an inflammatory component to their aetiology. Although these comorbid patterns have long been viewed as consequential to an unhealthy lifestyle or to the side effects of psychotropic drugs, it has been demonstrated that a pro-inflammatory signature, with elevated IL-1, IL-6, cortisol and leptin levels along with obesity, was observed in subjects already at risk of depressive, bipolar or psychotic disorders [35–37]. Similarly, the large majority of young subjects with autism spectrum disorders exhibit comorbid patterns, with more than 90 % suffering of gastrointestinal problems [38]. Abnormal metabolic and inflammatory signatures are thus associated with higher susceptibility for both comorbid medical and mental disorders [9].How to translate this observation into an agenda? Available data strongly suggests that currently defined psychiatric disorders could be either (or simultaneously) composed of diverse biological entities fitting under a same phenomenological spectrum umbrella or different phenomenological variants of a common underpinning pathophysiological process. First, we could use advanced methods, such as systems biology and theoretical “big data” bioinformatics, to identify new clusters of patients, integrating the complex phenotypic, anamnestic, psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, as well as familial and environmental risk factors, longitudinal history and biomarker profiling to shed light on these heterogeneous disorders [39]. The oncology field has successfully applied these techniques to evaluate the relevance of groups of factors and to identify bio-based clusters amenable to personalised treatment. Lifespan human and animal models that take into account the successive impact of environmental factors are also warranted to better understand the interactive and/or additive effect of these factors on the course of psychiatric disorders. Ideally, biological markers already identified in these disorders or extracted from the above emerging models in derivation studies could serve to design new “educated chips” that will contain immune, neurobiological and genetic markers defining subtypes of patients that could be further refined in validation studies (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Schematic illustration of the putative diversity within a psychiatric patient cohort (e.g. schizophrenic ones) diagnosed with a descriptive, and not mechanistic, nomenclature. The emerging field of immuno-psychiatry has the potential to open up the exploration of mechanism-based nosology and personalised treatment strategies once multiple variables (e.g. genetic, environmental, biological) are integrated to identify patient subgroups
The use of animal models could facilitate exploration of in-depth temporal and molecular pathways linking central and peripheral dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. For instance, since the discovery that some NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blockers induce schizophrenia-like psychosis, reproducing both positive and negative symptoms, the NMDA glutamatergic model of psychosis and schizophrenia has been increasingly accepted as part of the disease’s etiopathology [40]. The dysfunction of NMDAR signalling might originate, among other pathways, from genetic alteration, autoantibodies directed against extracellular epitopes [41–46], and/or altered levels of endogenous agonists/antagonists (kynurenine metabolites) [47]. Of note, the recent discovery that autoantibodies against extracellular epitopes of the NMDAR produce major psychosis [41–46] provides a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of psychotic disorders at the molecular, cellular and brain imaging levels. For instance, autoantibodies from anti-NMDA encephalitis patients altered NMDAR signalling by preventing molecular interaction and altering membrane trafficking of NMDAR, although without modulating the function of the NMDAR channel [43]. Thus, NMDAR dysfunction-induced psychosis could originate from a blockade of the channel (e.g. phencyclidine) or an altered trafficking of the receptor (e.g. autoantibodies). Future investigations in various psychotic disorders will thus shed new light on the mechanisms underlying these disorders and pave the way for new, innovative therapeutical strategies to restore proper NMDAR signaling.Could a common dysfunction be at the origin of peripheral disorders? Theoretically, yes. Indeed, it is often forgotten that NMDAR is not only expressed in brain cells but also in many other organs and cell types; for example, NMDAR is expressed in pancreatic islets and in insulin-secreting beta cells whose functional impairment contributes to diabetes. A recent study demonstrated that inhibition of NMDAR in mouse and human islet cells enhanced their glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and survival [48]. Thus, alterations in NMDAR signalling might directly confer risk for psychosis and diabetes. In addition, NMDAR is also expressed at the surface of epithelial barrier cells [49], monocytes [50] and lymphocytes [51], potentially regulating biological barriers and immune reactions. Finally, NMDAR is expressed by cardiac myocytes and cells of the basolateral proximal tubule in the kidney, and its activation in these systems produces important cellular and organ regulation (see [52] for a review). Thus, in addition to its well-established role in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders, alterations of NMDAR signalling could also sustain comorbid disorders in these patients (Fig. 2). Innovative and longitudinal models urgently need to be implemented in order to investigate the shared molecular pathways that could link comorbid somatic and psychiatric disorders as a whole.Fig. 2Example of the putative molecular link between medical comorbidities in psychotic disorders. An alteration of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor signalling, proposed to be central in the aetiology of psychotic disorders, may have varying impact in the various organs of these patients
Agenda for innovative treatment: new ways to prescribe existing drugs?Despite major advances in the understanding of severe psychiatric disorders, the number of new drugs made available is steadily declining [53]. Improving our understanding of the biological networks and systems associated with these complex disorders as well as identifying mechanism-based subgroups among large and complex psychiatric entities would facilitate a shift towards target-based high-throughput screening of large compound libraries as advocated for drug discovery [1]. If it is confirmed that subgroups of patients are characterised by factors such as infections, autoimmunity, inflammation and immunogenetic-mediated response to environmental factors, then several existing agents could be prescribed on the basis of their actions on the immune system [54]. For example, toxoplasmosis is the most common protozoa parasite infecting people with psychiatric disorders, with a 2.7-fold increase in overall odds of T. gondii seropositivity [55], as recently confirmed by a meta-analysis showing an association with T. gondii antibodies (immunoglobulin type G) in schizophrenia and obsessive–compulsive disorder [56]. Remarkably, bipolar disorder and schizophrenic patients seropositive for T. gondii appear to have a better outcome when receiving antipsychotics with known in vitro anti-toxoplasmic activity when compared to patients receiving a treatment without anti-toxoplasmic activity [57].One may also repurpose drugs that directly target inflammatory pathways to subgroups of patients with immune phenotypes. For instance, the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, which exhibits anti-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, glutamatergic and neurotrophic features, has been successfully tested in schizophrenia and major depressive disorders [58, 59]. Both aspirin [60] and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [59] reduce positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia when used as add-ons to standard antipsychotic therapy, whereas add-on celecoxib has anti-depressant effects [61]; the efficacy of NSAID therapy is now supported by meta-analysis [62]. N-acetylcysteine, which has redox, glutamatergic and anti-inflammatory properties, diminished symptom severity in add-on studies in schizophrenia and showed antidepressant effects in bipolar disorder and depression [63]. Ketamine and its metabolites worked in depression via their glutamatergic properties [64] as well as through robust effects on microglial suppression [65]. It is noteworthy that high inflammation has been shown to impair, to a certain extent, the action of antidepressants and antipsychotics [66, 67]. Thus, subgroups of psychiatric patients with infectious and inflammatory conditions should strongly benefit from adapted therapies, either with direct anti-inflammatory drugs or with antipsychotics with inherent anti-inflammatory properties.New treatments based on newly-validated targetsThe discovery and development of new medications for clinically and immunologically stratified subgroups of patients would represent a major breakthrough in the field of psychiatric disorders. New targets for pathway-driven nosology will be as important for the future as the above refined strategies. One may envision that developing new modulators of specific cytokines (e.g. neutralising interleukins), products of infection-activated human endogenous retrovirus (e.g. HERV-W), or peripheral and central nervous system receptors (e.g. glutamate NMDAR subunits) would be of great interest for the subgroup of patients with these immune phenotypes. For instance, biological immunotherapy that directly targets cytokines such as IL-6 are worthy of interest since elevated levels of IL-6 have been reported in and may serve as markers of both schizophrenia and mood disorders [68]. As antibodies opposing the effects of IL-6 have been successfully developed for autoimmune diseases, they are promising candidates for psychiatric disorders, although probably only in the presence of immune abnormalities such as elevated levels of IL-6, autoantibodies and infectious stigma. Another targeted immunotherapy might be the use of antibodies neutralising the envelope protein of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-W, found elevated in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [69], since the neutralising antibody GNbAC1 abrogates the HERV-W envelope protein and has been successfully tested in clinical trials of patients with multiple sclerosis [70].Nevertheless, the immense efforts made over the past decades, in particular by major pharmaceutical companies, to target the neurotransmitter receptor signalling pathways extensively correlated to psychiatric disorders have not paid off. Two new lines of exploration could be envisioned. First, most efforts have concentrated on the development of drugs with a direct modulatory effect on the receptor, whereas an emerging array of evidence point toward a major defect of neurotransmitter receptor trafficking in brain cells. Focusing on innovative strategies to restore proper trafficking, and thus signalling, constitutes a promising research area. Second, the emerging functional interplay between synaptic and immune receptors, supposedly involved in brain connection maturation during development [71] and psychiatric disorders [72], should prompt us to build mechanistic and integrated models to leverage the immense potential of the genome-wide association studies highlighting the interconnection between neurotransmission and immunity in psychiatric disorders.ConclusionBeyond the enormous economic burden that psychiatric disorders represent, the discovery of alterations in the intimate molecular networks that sustain the diseases and their application to develop novel therapeutic strategies is one of the most exciting and key scientific challenges for the 21st century. Here, we advocate that the path to discovery would first require a “deconstruction” of current practices to segment psychiatric disorders and we suggest elements of a research agenda to adapt clinical practice and foster research paradigms. The grounds for reconstruction should be based on the integration of a reconciled body–brain interface leading to a new “immuno-psychiatry-based nosology”. Indeed, the accumulating evidence that immune and environmental alterations play a key role in the aetiology of seemingly diverse disorders provides a promising opportunity to define latent subgroups that share immune, genetic and brain alterations. Innovative animal models are within our grasp to fully identify and properly address emerging obstacles. The opportunities for therapeutic strategies, both by re-purposing existing drugs and by identifying targets with new angles, may be immense and could provide the necessary hope that clinicians, pharmaceutical companies and, most importantly, patients may have gradually lost over the past decades.This work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, Conseil Régional d’Aquitaine, Labex Bordeaux BRAIN, fondation FondaMental, Labex Bio-PSY, and Ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche.

We have mapped the putative monoamine connections, as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections, in C. elegans based on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide networks exhibit distinct topological properties, with the monoamine network displaying a highly disassortative star-like structure with a rich-club of interconnected broadcasting hubs, and the neuropeptide network showing a more recurrent, highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between the extrasynaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes, we find highly significant multilink motifs of interaction, pinpointing locations in the network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity. Thus, the C. elegans connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with synaptic, gap junction, and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or junctional circuits and extrasynaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small number of modulatory neurons.Author SummaryConnectomics represents an effort to map brain structure at the level of individual neurons and their synaptic connections. However, neural circuits also depend on other types of signalling between neurons, such as extrasynaptic modulation by monoamines and peptides. Here we present a draft monoamine connectome, along with a partial neuropeptide connectome, for the nematode C. elegans, based on new and published expression data for biosynthetic genes and receptors. We describe the structural properties of these \"wireless\" networks, including their topological features and modes of interaction with the wired synaptic and gap junction connectomes. This multilayer connectome of C. elegans can serve as a prototype for understanding the multiplex networks comprising larger nervous systems, including the human brain.http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440Wellcome TrustWT103784MASchaferWilliam Ronaldhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265Medical Research CouncilMC-A022-5PB91SchaferWilliam Ronaldhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002National Institutes of Health5T32DK007328-37http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1977-0761YeminiEviatarhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265Medical Research CouncilMR/K020706/1VertesPetra E.http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440Wellcome TrustBullmoreEdward T.We thank the MRC (grant MC-A022-5PB91 to WRS) and Wellcome Trust (grant WT103784MA to WRS) for funding.

The C. elegans nervous system has served as a prototype for analytical studies of connectome networks, since the synaptic connections made by each of its 302 neurons have been completely mapped at the level of electron microscopy [2, 3]. Through this approach, the C. elegans nervous system has been found to share a number of topological features in common with most other real-world networks, from human brain networks through social networks to the internet [1, 4, 5]. One well-known example is the small-world phenomenon, whereby networks are simultaneously highly clustered (nodes that are connected to each other are also likely to have many nearest neighbours in common) and highly efficient (the average path length between a pair of nodes is short) [6, 7]. Another characteristic feature of real-world networks which has attracted much attention is the existence of hubs or high-degree nodes, with many more connections to the rest of the network than expected in a random graph [8]. As in other networks, these topological features of the C. elegans connectome are thought to reflect the functional needs of the system [9, 10]. For example hubs are known to play a privileged role in coordinating functions across a distributed network [11], while the short path lengths (often mediated by the hubs) help increase the efficiency of information transfer across the network [6].Although connectomics has primarily focused on mapping the synaptic links between neurons, it is well established that chemical synapses are only one of several modes of interaction between neurons. For example, gap junctions, which mediate fast, potentially bidirectional electrical coupling between cells, are widespread in all nervous systems. Likewise, volume transmission and neurohumoral signalling provide means for local or long-range communication between neurons unconnected by synapses. As neuromodulators released through these routes can have profound effects on neural activity and behaviour [12–14], a full understanding of neural connectivity requires a detailed mapping of these extrasynaptic pathways.In C. elegans, as in many animals, one important route of neuromodulation is through monoamine signalling. Monoamines are widespread throughout phyla, with evidence that they are one of the oldest signalling systems, evolving at least 1 billion years ago [15]. In both humans and C. elegans, many neurons expressing aminergic receptors are not post-synaptic to releasing neurons, indicating that a significant amount of monoamine signalling occurs outside the wired connectome [16]. Monoamines are known to be essential for normal brain function, with abnormal signalling being implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions [17]. In C. elegans, these monoaminergic systems play similarly diverse roles in regulating locomotion, reproduction, feeding states, sensory adaptation, and learning [16]. Clearly, if the goal of connectomics is to understand behaviourally relevant communication within the brain, extrasynaptic monoamine interactions must also be mapped, not just the network of wired chemical synapses and gap junctions.In addition to monoamines, neuropeptides are also widely used as neuromodulators in the C. elegans nervous system. C. elegans contains over 250 known or predicted neuropeptides synthesized from at least 122 precursor genes, and over 100 putative peptide receptors [18, 19]. These include homologues of several well-known vertebrate neuropeptide receptors, including those for oxytocin/vasopressin (NTR-1), neuropeptide Y (NPR-1) and cholecystokinin (CKR-2) [19]. As in other animals, neuropeptide signalling is critical for nervous system function, and frequently involves hormonal or other extrasynaptic mechanisms.This study describes a draft connectome of extrasynaptic monoamine signalling in C. elegans, as well as a partial network of neuropeptide signalling, based on new and published gene expression data. We find that the extrasynaptic connectomes exhibit topological properties distinct from one another as well as from the wired connectome. Overall, the neuronal connectome can be modelled as a multiplex network with structurally distinct synaptic, gap junction, and extrasynaptic (neuromodulatory) layers representing neuronal interactions with different dynamics and polarity, and with critical interaction points allowing communication between layers. This network represents a prototype for understanding how neuromodulators interact with wired circuitry in larger nervous systems and for understanding the organisational principles of multiplex networks.ResultsA network of extrasynaptic monoamine signallingTo investigate the extent of extrasynaptic signalling in C. elegans monoamine systems, we systematically compared the expression patterns of monoamine receptors with the postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons. Monoamine-producing cells were identified based on the published expression patterns of appropriate biosynthetic enzymes and vesicular transporters (see Methods). The expression patterns for each of five serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-5, ser-7 and mod-1), three octopamine receptors (octr-1, ser-3 and ser-6), four tyramine receptors (ser-2, tyra-2, tyra-3 and lgc-55), and four dopamine receptors (dop-1, dop-2, dop-3 and dop-4) were compiled from published data (see S1–S7 Tables). Since these receptors are either ion channels or serpentine receptors predicted to couple to pan-neuronal G-proteins, we therefore assumed all neurons expressing monoamine receptors are potential monoamine-responding cells.Three additional genes encode known or candidate monoamine receptors but have missing or incomplete expression data. Specifically, a ligand-gated chloride channel, lgc-53, has been shown to be activated by dopamine [20], but its expression pattern and biological function have not been characterized. Additional expression profiling using a transgenic lgc-53 reporter line crossed to a series of known reference strains indicated that lgc-53 is expressed in a small subset of neurons in the head, body and tail (Fig 1). Together with the published dop-1, dop-2, dop-3 and dop-4-expressing cells, these were inferred to make up the domain of dopamine-responding neurons. In addition, two G-protein coupled receptors, dop-5 and dop-6, have been hypothesized based on sequence similarity to dop-3 to be dopamine receptors. Using the same approach used for lgc-53, we identified most of the cells with clear expression of dop-5 and dop-6 reporters (Fig 1). These cells were included in a broader provisional dopamine network, the analysis of which is presented in the supplemental material (S1 Fig, S3 Fig).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g001Fig 1Expression patterns of the dopamine receptors dop-5, dop-6 & lgc-53.Shown are representative images showing expression of GFP reporters under the control of indicated receptor promoters in the head (left panels) or tail/posterior body (right panels). Identified neurons are labelled; procedures for confirmation of cell identities are described in methods. In all panels, dorsal is up and anterior is to the left. In addition to the neurons indicated, dopamine receptor reporters were detected in the following neurons: dop-5: BDU (some animals); lgc-53: CAN (some animals).Receptor expression patterns suggest that a remarkably high fraction of monoamine signalling must be extrasynaptic. For example, the two tyraminergic neurons, RIML and RIMR, are presynaptic to a total of 20 neurons. Yet of the 114 neurons that express reporters for one or more of the four tyramine (TA) receptors, only 7 are postsynaptic to a tyraminergic neuron (Fig 2A; Table 1). Thus, approximately 94% of tyramine-responsive neurons must respond only to extrasynaptic TA. Similar analyses of the other monoamine systems yield comparable results: 100% of neurons expressing octopamine receptors receive no synaptic input from octopamine-releasing neurons (Fig 2B), while 82% of neurons expressing dopamine receptors, and 76% of neurons expressing serotonin receptors receive no synaptic input from neurons expressing the cognate monoamine ligand (Table 1). Thus, most neuronal monoamine signalling in C. elegans appears to occur extrasynaptically, outside the wired synaptic connectome. The prevalence of extrasynaptic monoamine signalling between neurons unconnected by synapses or gap junctions implies the existence of a large wireless component to the functional C. elegans connectome, the properties of which have not previously been studied.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g002Fig 2Monoamine signalling in C. elegans is primarily extrasynaptic.(A) RIM tyramine releasing neurons, showing outgoing synaptic edges (arrows), and neurons expressing one or more of the four tyramine receptors (grey).

Since biologically-relevant long-distance signalling (e.g. from releasing cells in the head to tail motoneurons) has been experimentally demonstrated in C. elegans for both dopamine and serotonin [21, 22]–while tyramine and octopamine are each released from a single neuronal class [16]–edges were not restricted based on the physical distance between nodes. For the serotonin network, only those neurons with strong, consistent expression of serotonin biosynthetic markers such as tryptophan hydroxylase were included (NSM, HSN and ADF). Additional neurons (AIM, RIH, VC4/5) that appear to take up serotonin but not synthesize it [23][24] were not included in the network, since they may function primarily in the homeostatic clearing of serotonin. We also did not include the ASG neurons, which produce serotonin only under hypoxic conditions [25], though they are likely to participate conditionally in the serotonin signalling networks.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.t002Table 2Table showing the number of nodes and edges in the individual and aggregate monoamine networks.Values for an expanded network including putative dop-5 and dop-6 connections are in parentheses.NetworkNodes N№ ligand expressing№ receptor expressingEdges M→Serotonin86682490Dopamine147 (187)8147 (187)1168 (1488)Octopamine2822854Tyramine1162114228Aggregate237 (251)18235 (251)1940 (2260)The C. elegans connectome forms a multiplex network with nonredundant layersWith the inclusion of the monoamine systems, the full C. elegans connectome can be considered as a multiplex or multilayer network [26], with each node representing a neuron and each layer of connections–synaptic, gap junction, and monoamine–characterized by distinct edge properties (Fig 2D). For example, chemical synapses represent unidirectional, wired connections that signal on a fast (ms) time scale, while gap junctions generate reciprocal electrical connections that function on an even faster time scale. In contrast, monoamine connections are wireless (with a single sending cell broadcasting to multiple receivers), slow (acting on a time scale of seconds or longer) and unidirectional [22, 27]. Conceptually, additional modes of signalling between neurons, such as peptide neuromodulation, could represent additional layers.Prior studies of multiplex networks in non-biological systems–such as communication networks–have tended to find a large degree of overlap between the links observed in distinct layers, implying that they may not be truly independent channels of interaction [28]. In contrast, we observe that out of 1940 monoamine connections only 80 overlap with chemical or electrical synapses, meaning 96% of the monoamine connections are unique to the monoamine layer (Fig 2C; Table 1). Reducibility analysis [28], which clusters the different network layers based on their redundancy or degree of overlap, provides further support that the monoamine networks have a unique structure. Considered either separately or in the aggregate, the monoamines form a distinct cluster separate from the wired synaptic and gap junction networks (Fig 3A and 3B). This shows that the monoamine networks overlap less with the synaptic and gap junction networks than the synaptic and gap junction networks do with each other.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g003Fig 3Monoamine networks are largely non-overlapping with the wired connectome.(A-B) Multilayer reducibility dendrograms. Panel A considers monoamine and neuropeptide networks in aggregate; panel B considers monoamine systems individually with neuropeptide systems not included. Layers close on the dendrogram have more overlapping edges and are more reducible. Branching height gives the Jensen-Shannon distance between the layers. (C) Degree-degree correlation matrix. Off-diagonal panels show the degree-degree correlation between a pair of network layers. Panels on the diagonal show the degree distribution of the individual layers. Monoamine hubs correspond to releasing neurons, which are distinct for each monoamine. (D) Hive plot showing the wired synaptic (magenta), gap junction (blue), and monoamine connections (green). Nodes are classified as sensory, motor or interneurons and are arranged along the three axes according to their degree. Hubs are located further out along the axes.Similarly, in many previously-described multiplex networks, the high-degree hubs in each layer are often co-located, unequivocally highlighting certain nodes as key controllers of information flow in the system [26]. While the synaptic and gap junction layers of the worm connectome are observed to follow this trend, with the same high-degree neurons in both systems (Fig 3C), the extrasynaptic monoamine network exhibits a vastly different structure. While the synaptic and gap junction degrees of individual nodes show high positive correlation (R = .594), no significant degree-degree correlation is observed between the wired and extrasynaptic monoamine layers, indicating that the hubs of the monoamine system are distinct. These analyses suggest two distinct interpretations for the dissimilarity to the wired network layers. Firstly, monoamines may be functioning as an independent network, with little relation to the faster wired network. Secondly, the dissimilarity between layers might indicate that monoamines have a complementary function that is nevertheless coupled to that of the synaptic and gap junction connections.Analysis of monoamine network topologyTo address these possibilities, we investigated whether the isolated C. elegans monoamine network displays the structural organisation required for information processing. Considered separately, the monoamine networks of C. elegans consist of only a few topologically central neurons that broadcast signals to a large number of peripheral neurons. These monoamine-releasing cells are mostly sensory and motor neurons, with the downstream receptors being distributed throughout the worm (Fig 3D). In total, 18 of the 302 neurons in the adult hermaphrodite release monoamines, while 251 neurons (83%) were found to express one or more monoamine receptors. This gives the network a star-like topology, which can be directly observed in all of the separate monoamine networks (Fig 4A, S1 Fig). As a consequence, the monoamine network exhibits a heavy tailed distribution containing a small number of high-degree hubs (Fig 3C). This structure is also reflected in other topological network measures, with the monoamine network exhibiting high disassortativity characteristic of star networks (Fig 4B). Disassortativity is known to be relevant in the organisation of collective network dynamics, such as synchronisation [29] and cooperation behaviour [30, 31], and is widely observed in other biological and technological networks [32]. The star-like structure of the monoamine layer was also confirmed by three-neuron motif analysis, which revealed the enrichment of a motif consisting of a hub node signalling to two spokes (S2 Fig).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g004Fig 4Topological properties of the C. elegans extrasynaptic networks.(A) Multilayer expansion of monoamine subnetworks. Node positions are the same in all layers. (B-F) Comparison of network metrics for the synaptic (syn), gap junction (gap), monoamine network (MA), aggregate wired & monoamine network (MA+), neuropeptide (NP) and complete aggregate (all) networks. Plots show the observed values (filled squares) and expected values for 100 rewired networks preserving degree distribution (boxplots). Network measures for individual monoamine networks and dop-5/6-containing aggregate network are presented in S1 Fig.The inclusion of these additional monoamine connections into the connectome has a number of effects on the aggregate network. For one, it greatly reduces the overall path length of the network (Fig 4C), increasing the efficiency of integrative information processing by providing paths between more segregated subgraphs of the wired network [33]. In particular, monoamine signalling provides a direct route of communication between sensory neurons and motor neurons (Fig 3D), bypassing the premotor interneurons that play a prominent role in the synaptic and gap junction systems [11]. Together, these observations suggest that the monoamines provide efficient global connections for coordinating behaviour throughout the entire organism due to the presence of highly connected hubs directly linking many disparate parts of the network. This is a useful feature given the role of monoamines in signalling physiologically important states relevant to the entire organism, such as food availability [27]. The increased connectivity provided by the monoamines also results in a reduction in the aggregate network's modular structure, a consequence of increasing the number of connections between functionally segregated units (Fig 4D). The network is, however, still more modular than random, with the monoamine layer also exhibiting greater-than-random modularity compared to null models that rewire the network edges while preserving degree distribution (see Methods). This is expected given the monoamine layer's composition from separate signalling systems; indeed the individual monoamine networks considered on their own show very low modularity (S1 Fig).Despite the hub-and-spoke structure of the extrasynaptic network, the monoamine layer exhibits a significant level of global clustering (measured here as transitivity) (Fig 4E). This observation is explained by two factors. Firstly, the expression of monoamine receptors by releasing neurons creates a central cluster of hub neurons in the network; secondly, as many neurons also express more than one monoamine receptor, triangles are formed in the network with a receiving neuron as one vertex, and two transmitting neurons as the others. Indeed, three-neuron motif analysis confirmed that this configuration is overrepresented in all the monoamine networks save tyramine (S2 Fig). This structure provides a method of dual lateral inhibition, where a releasing neuron can inhibit antagonistic signals from another hub neuron while simultaneously negating the downstream effects of those signals, a pattern previously observed in the OA/TA and 5-HT systems between RIC/RIM & NSM in the aminergic control of feeding behaviours [34]. Similar patterns also exist within individual monoamine layers; for example, the ventral cord motor neurons express both excitatory (dop-1) and inhibitory (dop-3) dopamine receptors [35], while the expression of an inhibitory receptor (dop-2) in dopamine-releasing neurons suggests that the hubs mutually suppress one another to regulate dopamine release.Many neural and brain networks have been shown to exhibit rich-club organisation [36–39] in which the most highly-connected nodes are more connected to one another than expected by chance [40]. It was previously shown that the C. elegans wired connectome includes a rich-club consisting primarily of a small number of premotor interneurons, controlling forward and backward locomotion [11]. Subjecting the monoamine connectome to similar analysis, it was found that this network also contains a distinct rich-club (Fig 5A and 5B; Table 3), consisting of dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine-releasing neurons. The rich-club property stems from the fact that most serotonergic neurons contain receptors for both tyramine and dopamine, while dopaminergic and tyraminergic neurons likewise express receptors for the other two aminergic transmitters (Fig 5B), suggesting that the different monoamines coordinate their actions. This rich-club structure is also reflected in the 3-neuron motif analysis, in which the fully-connected motif was overrepresented in the aggregate monoamine layer (S2 Fig). Interestingly, in contrast to the wired rich-club, all of whose members are interneurons, the monoamine rich-club consists of sensory neurons and motor neurons (Fig 5C, Table 3).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g005Fig 5Monoamine rich-club.(A) Rich-club curve for the directed monoamine network.

The receptors for many neuropeptides, and the ligands for many neuropeptide receptors, remain unknown; moreover, the distance over which signalling can occur is uncharacterized for most neuropeptide systems. Despite these caveats, we reasoned that a partial and provisional neuropeptide network could provide useful insight into the differences between peptide signalling networks and synaptic, gap junction and monoamine networks. We focused on 12 neuropeptide receptors with well-established ligands (with biologically-plausible EC50 values in in vitro assays) and precisely-characterized expression patterns for both receptor and peptide precursor genes (S8 Table, S9 Table). Networks were classified by receptor, allowing many-to-many relationships between neuropeptides and receptors. Even for this partial network, 239 neurons are seen to be involved in neuropeptide signalling (out of 302 possible) with 7035 connections between them, providing greater connectivity than either the synaptic or monoamine layers. Of the receptor-expressing neurons, almost 60% received no synaptic input from neurons expressing one of their ligands, suggesting that at least for this partial network, neuropeptide signalling, like monoamine signalling, is largely extrasynaptic. Likewise, the majority of edges in the neuropeptide network do not overlap with synapses (97% non-overlapping), again consistent with a largely extrasynaptic mode of signalling (Fig 6A).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g006Fig 6Neuropeptide networks.(A) Adjacency matrix showing the synaptic (magenta) and neuropeptide (green) networks. (B) Multilayer reducibility dendrograms for individual neuropeptide networks. Layers close on the dendrogram have more overlapping edges and are more reducible. Branching height gives the Jensen-Shannon distance between the layers. Wired and monoamine layers are italicized and indicated with green (MA), blue (gap junction), or magenta (synaptic) boxes. (C) Multilayer expansion of wired, monoamine, and neuropeptide networks. Node positions are the same in all layers.The neuropeptide network, like the monoamine network, exhibits a structure distinct from the wired connectome. No significant degree correlation was observed between the partial neuropeptide network and the synaptic, gap junction, or monoamine networks, indicating that neuropeptide hubs are distinct from those in other layers (Fig 3C). Likewise, reducibility analysis shows low overlap between the neuropeptide edges and those in the monoamine, synaptic and gap junction layers (Fig 3A). Interestingly, some individual neuropeptide systems, in particular CKR-2, overlap significantly with the networks of monoamine systems, while others, including the neuropeptide F/Y receptors NPR-1/2/5/11, show little overlap with either the wired or other extrasynaptic networks (Fig 6B).Examining the network measures for the neuropeptide network reveal it to have some topological properties in common with the monoamine network, but also crucial differences. For example, both networks have a shorter characteristic path length and lower modularity than the wired networks (Fig 4C and 4D). On the other hand, the neuropeptide network has much higher clustering than any other connectome layer (Fig 4E), and is significantly less disassortative (Fig 4B) than the monoamine network. In part, this is an expected consequence of the large number of connections in the neuropeptide network; however, the observed clustering in the neuropeptide network was significantly higher even than null models with the same edge density. In addition, the neuropeptide network shows much higher reciprocity than the monoamine network (Fig 4F), with the individual neuropeptide systems generally lacking the star-like topology characteristic of the monoamines (Fig 6C).Modes of interaction between wired and extrasynaptic layersDespite the distinct structures and topologies of the different neuronal connectome layers, they are likely to interact in functionally significant ways. For example, although the wired and monoamine rich-clubs do not overlap, there are significant links between them (Fig 5C). To systematically identify neurons that have a role in linking all of the layers, neurons were first ordered according to the product of their degree-rank across the synaptic, gap junction and monoamine layers (Table 4). We observe that the highest ranking neurons, which have the highest participation across all layers, include three from the monoamine rich-club (RIML, RIMR, and ADEL) and two from the wired rich-club (RIBL and DVA). Indeed, the premotor interneuron DVA is a receiver for serotonin, tyramine and (provisionally) dopamine signalling, while the tyraminergic RIMs are highly connected to the premotor interneurons of the wired rich-club. As one might expect from their topological role in linking the monoamine and wired network layers, the RIMs have been shown in a number of studies to play a central role in the modulation of sensory pathways in response to feeding states as well as the control of downstream locomotion motor programs [41–43]. Similarly RIB, which expresses receptors for serotonin and dopamine, is thought to integrate numerous sensory signals [44, 45] and has been demonstrated to influence reorientation in foraging behaviour [46].10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.t004Table 4Multilayer hub neurons for 3-layer connectomes.The normalized degree product (knorm) showing the neurons with the highest degree rank across all of the layers.

Since each layer contains the same set of nodes but a different pattern of edges, the frequencies with which different combinations of links co-occur between pairs of nodes throughout the multiplex network can be determined. Of the 20 possible multilink motifs, seven were found to be overrepresented and four underrepresented compared to networks composed from randomized layers (Fig 7). Many of these do not involve monoamines; for example, three overrepresented motifs–reciprocal chemical synapses (motif 3) and the co-occurrence of a gap junction with a single or reciprocal chemical synapse (motifs 5 & 6)–have been reported in an earlier analysis of the wired network [5]. These also align with results from the degree-degree correlation and reducibility (Fig 3A, 3B and 3C) indicating that synapses and gap junctions frequently overlap. This is mirrored in the underrepresentation of motifs 2 & 4 corresponding to synapses or gap junctions alone; conversely, the underrepresentation of these single link motifs leads to an overrepresentation of unlinked pairs (motif 1).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283.g007Fig 7Modes of interaction between connectome layers.Shown are overrepresented and underrepresented multilink motifs for 3-layer networks consisting of synaptic, gap junction and monoamine (aggregate or individual MA) layers.

These correspond to all possible configurations of links between two neurons allowing for: no connection of a given type (dotted line), directed extrasynaptic monoamine links (Ext, represented as arrows on the top), bidirectional gap junctions (represented as bars in the middle) and synapses (represented as inverted arrowheads on the bottom line).

The most interesting (and statistically significant) of these corresponds to a unidirectional monoamine link coincident with reciprocal synaptic connections (motif 10). The structure of this motif is well-suited to provide positive or negative feedback in response to experience, suggesting that this may be a functionally important aspect of monoamine activity within the wider network. Indeed, connections of this type (Table 6) have been implicated in a number of C. elegans behaviours; for example, motif 10 connections between ADF and AIY have been shown to be important for the learning of pathogen avoidance [48] and connections between RIM and RMD are important for the suppression of head movements during escape behaviour [49]. Putative motif 10 connections between PDE and DVA are also thought to play a role in controlling neuropeptide release [50].Intriguingly, most examples of motif 10 (all except RIMR-RMDR) involve either serotonin or dopamine as the monoamine transmitter. Indeed, when we considered the monoamine networks separately (e.g. Syn-Gap-DA or Syn-Gap-TA multilink), motif 10 was overrepresented for multilink containing either serotonin and dopamine (Fig 7C and 7D, S3 Fig), but not for tyramine or octopamine (Fig 7E, S3 Fig). Interestingly, two different motifs were found to be overrepresented in the 3-layer octopamine network (Fig 7E, S11 Table), motif 9 (a unidirectional synaptic connection coincident with an octopamine connection in the opposite direction) and motif 11 (a unidirectional octopamine link coincident with a gap junction). (Presumably these were not overrepresented in the aggregate network because the octopamine network is much smaller than the networks for the other monoamines). These motifs might serve similar functions to motif 10 for dopamine and serotonin in providing feedback to modulate wired connections.Interestingly, although the neuropeptide network showed little structural overlap with the monoamine network, its modes of interaction with the wired connectome showed striking parallels. When the neuropeptide network was included in the multiplex participation analysis, we observed that the RIM and DVA neurons continue to play central roles in linking the four network layers (S12 Table). Likewise, multilink motif analysis, this time using the neuropeptide and wired layers, again identified motif 10 (a unidirectional neuromodulatory connection coincident with a reciprocal synaptic connection) as significantly overrepresented, further supporting the notion that this motif plays a key role in extrasynaptic modulation of synaptic computation (S3 Fig; S13 Table). Even more highly overrepresented relative to expectation was motif 20, reciprocal neuropeptide and synaptic connections coincident with a gap junction. This motif was not overrepresented in the multilink analysis for monoamines, perhaps because of the low reciprocity of the monoamine network. Interestingly, several of the motif 20 multilink (S14 Table) are components of the RMG hub and spoke network, which has been implicated in the control of various behaviours including locomotion, aggregation, and pheromone response [51, 52].DiscussionThis study has analysed the properties of an expanded C. elegans neuronal connectome, which incorporates newly-compiled networks of extrasynaptic monoamine and neuropeptide signalling. Analyses reveal that these extrasynaptic networks have structures distinct from the synaptic network, and from one another. The monoamine network has a highly disassortative, star-like topology, with a small number of high-degree broadcasting hubs interconnected to form a rich-club core. The monoamine systems are thus well-suited to broadly coordinate global neural and behavioural states across the connectome. Although the partial neuropeptide network we analyse is only a small sample of the complete network, it shows a different, highly clustered topology with higher reciprocity, suggesting the importance of these neuropeptide systems in the cohesion of the nervous system. While these extrasynaptic networks are separate and non-overlapping with the wired connectome, the hubs of both the wired and wireless networks are interconnected, with multilink motifs showing interaction between the systems at specific points in the network. This suggests that the extrasynaptic networks function both independently–coordinating for example through the monoamine rich-club–and in unison with the synaptic network through multilayer hubs such as RIM and through overrepresented multilink motifs.The low degree of overlap between the monoamine and synaptic networks occurs not only because many neurons expressing monoamine receptors are not postsynaptic to aminergic neurons, but also because many postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons to not appear to express monoamine receptors. Some of these synapses could be explained by cotransmission; in particular, tyraminergic and serotonergic neurons also express either cholinergic or glutaminergic markers, and thus classical transmitters could be used in these wired synapses. However, the dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons of C. elegans are not known to coexpress any classical neurotransmitter. A second possibility is that these synapses could utilize synaptically-released peptides as neurotransmitters. A third possibility is that the postsynaptic cells might express either an unknown monoamine receptor, or a known one at levels too low to be detected using existing reporters. Finally, it is possible that these putative synapses, which have been identified on the basis of electron micrographs, are not really functional synapses. Further work will be necessary to resolve this puzzling question.The importance of extrasynaptic neuromodulation to the function of neural circuits is clearly established, for example from work on crustacean stomatogastric circuits [13]. However, systematic attempts to map whole-organism connectomes have focused primarily on chemical synapses, with even gap junctions being difficult to identify using high-throughput electron microscopy approaches [53]. The incorporation of extrasynaptic neuromodulatory interactions, inferred here from gene expression data, adds a large number of new links largely non-overlapping with those of the wired connectome. Although the valence and strength of these inferred neuromodulatory links are largely unknown (information also lacking for much of the synaptic connectome), the monoamine and neuropeptide networks described here nonetheless provide a far more complete picture of potential pathways of communication between different parts of the C. elegans nervous system.Topological properties of monoamine and neuropeptide networksAlthough monoamine and neuropeptide signalling both occur extrasynaptically and act on similar timescales, the monoamine and neuropeptide networks show distinct topologies, perhaps reflecting differences in biological function. As noted previously, the monoamine network has a star-like architecture that is qualitatively different to the other network layers. This structure is reflected in the network's high disassortativity and in the low number of recurrent connections. In addition, we observed that the monoamine network contains a rich-club of highly interconnected high-degree releasing neurons, whose members are distinct from (though linked to) the rich-club of the wired connectome. Together, this structure is well-suited to the organisation of collective network dynamics, and is a useful feature given the role of monoamines in signalling physiologically important states relevant to the entire organism, such as food availability.Despite enormous differences in scale, the monoamine systems of C. elegans and mammals share a number of common properties suggestive of common network topology. As in C. elegans, mammalian brains contain a relatively small number of monoamine-releasing neurons that project widely to diverse brain regions; for example, in humans serotonin is produced by less than 100,000 cells in the raphe nuclei, or one millionth of all brain neurons [54]. Moreover, extrasynaptic volume transmission is thought to account for much, if not most, monoamine signalling throughout the mammalian brain [55, 56]. Parallels between monoamine systems in C. elegans and larger nervous systems are not exact; for example, in C. elegans, most if not all aminergic neurons appear capable of long-distance signalling, whereas monoamines in larger nervous systems can be restricted by glial diffusion barriers [57]. Nonetheless, mammalian monoamine-releasing neurons, like their C. elegans counterparts, appear to function as high-degree broadcasting hubs with functionally and spatially diverse targets [54]. Thus, understanding how such hubs act within the context of the completely mapped wired circuitry of C. elegans, may provide useful insights into the currently unknown structures of multilayer neuronal networks in larger animals.Although the neuropeptide network has been only partially characterized, the partial network analysed here suggests it may differ in important ways from the other connectome layers, including the monoamine network. In particular, the neuropeptide layer shows strikingly high clustering, even taking into account its high density of connections, and higher reciprocity than the monoamine network. These properties suggest the neuropeptide networks are important for cohesiveness within the nervous system. Multilink analysis also identified differences between the extrasynaptic monoamine and neuropeptide networks. In both cases, a unidirectional extrasynaptic connection coincident with a reciprocal synaptic connection (motif 10) was overrepresented in the multiplex connectome. This motif is well-suited to provide feedback between linked nodes, and occurs in several microcircuits implicated in learning and memory. For neuropeptides, a second multilink motif, involving reciprocal neuromodulatory and synaptic connections coincident with a gap junction (motif 20) was even more highly overrepresented. This motif occurs in several places in the RMG-centred hub-and-spoke circuit that plays a key role in control of aggregation and arousal. As more neuropeptide systems become characterized, it is reasonable to expect additional examples of this motif will be identified; these may likewise have important computational roles in key neural circuits.A prototype for multiplex network analysisWhile network theory has occasionally provided novel insights in C. elegans biology, more often the C. elegans wired connectome has provided a useful test-bed for validating new network theoretical concepts or their application to larger mammalian brains [10]. In recent years, multilayer complex systems have become an area of intense focus within network science, with a large number of papers dedicated to extending classical network metrics to the multilayer case and to developing new frameworks to understand the dynamical properties of multilayer systems [58].By definition, multilayer networks contain much more information than simple monoplex networks, leading to significant data-collection challenges. In social networks, for example, large monoplex datasets have been collected describing various types of interactions between people, but these are typically disparate datasets based on different populations. Multiplex datasets combining various edge types into a number of layers are often restricted in size (the number of nodes for which data are collected) or in the choice of edges it is possible to consider (interaction types constrained by data availability) [58].The multiplex connectome of C. elegans has the potential to emerge as a gold standard in the study of multilayer networks, much like the wired C. elegans connectome has for the study of simple monoplex networks over the last 15 years. The synaptic, gap junction, and monoamine layers already represent a relatively reliable and complete mapping of three distinct connection types. The lack of degree-degree correlation between some of these layers suggests that they are not just different facets of one true underlying network (such that each edge is essentially duplicated across all layers). Rather, it suggests that the wired and wireless layers provide distinct channels of communication with differing functional roles. We therefore expect wired and wireless connections to be coupled in functionally relevant 3-node and 4-node motif structures [59, 60], such as (for example) monoamine-based feedback loops or monoamine-regulated wired interactions. The different time-scales on which each of the layers operates are also likely to allow the emergence of interesting dynamical phenomena. Finally, the large number of distinct extrasynaptic interactions offers the scope for a more refined dataset, each aligned to the same complete set of 302 nodes.Prospects for complete mapping of multilayer connectomesHow feasible is it to obtain a complete multiplex neuronal connectome? Although the neuropeptide network described here represents only a sample of the total network, the monoamine network already represents a reasonable draft of a complete monoamine connectome. Since expression patterns for amine receptors have been based on reporter coexpression with well-characterized markers, the rate of false positives (i.e. neurons falsely identified as monoamine receptor expressing) is probably very low. In contrast, the false-negative rate (monoamine receptor-expressing cells not included in the network) is almost certainly somewhat higher. In some cases (e.g. dop-4 and dop-3 in ASH [27, 61]), reporter transgenes appear to underreport full functional expression domains; in others (e.g. ser-5) only a subset of cells expressing a particular reporter have been identified [62]. With recently developed marker strains [60, 63], it should be possible to revisit cell identification and fill in at least some of these missing gaps. In addition, other monoamines (e.g. melatonin [64]) might function as neuromodulators in C. elegans, and some of the currently uncharacterized orphan receptors in the worm genome [19] might respond to monoamines. Potentially, some of these receptors might be expressed in postsynaptic targets of aminergic neurons (in particular, those of dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons, which are not known to express classical neurotransmitters). However, the existence of additional monoamine receptor-expressing cells also means that non-synaptic edges are almost certainly undercounted in the network. Thus, the high degree of monoamine releasing hubs–and their importance for intraneuronal signalling outside the wired connectome–is if anything understated by the current findings.In the future, it should be possible to expand the scope of the multilayer connectome to gain a more complete picture of intraneuronal functional connectivity. Obtaining extrasynaptic connectomes for larger brains, especially those of mammals, will likely be vastly more complicated than for C. elegans, due not only to the increase in size, but also the existence of additional structural and dynamical properties, such as glial barriers, cellular swelling, and arterial pulsations, all of which dynamically alter extracellular diffusion [65, 66]. In contrast, reanalysis of reporters for monoamine receptors using recently developed reference strains [60, 63] could provide a largely complete monoamine signalling network for C. elegans. A greater challenge would be to obtain a complete neuropeptide network; this would require comprehensive de-orphanization of neuropeptide GPCRs as well as expression patterns for hundreds of receptor and peptide genes. Additional layers of neuronal connectivity also remain unmapped, such as extrasynaptic signalling by insulin-like peptides, purines, and classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA [67–69]. Obtaining this information, while difficult, is uniquely feasible in C. elegans given the small size and precise cellular characterisation of its nervous system. Such a comprehensive multilayer connectome could serve as a prototype for understanding how different modes of signalling interact in the context of neuronal circuitry.Materials & MethodsSynaptic & gap junction networksThe synaptic and gap junction networks used in this work were based on the full hermaphrodite C. elegans connectome, containing all 302 neurons. This network was composed from the somatic connectome of White et al [2], updated and released by the Chklovskii lab [5, 70]; and the pharyngeal network of Albertson and Thomson [3], made available by the Cybernetic Caenorhabditis elegans Program (CCeP) (http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/ccep/) [71]. The functional classifications referred to in the text (i.e. sensory neuron, interneuron, motorneuron) are based on the classification scheme used in WormAtlas [72]. The gap junction network was modelled as an undirected network with bidirectional electrical synapses; note however that some gap junctions might be rectifying and thus exhibit directionality.Monoamine network constructionTo map the aminergic signalling networks of C. elegans, a literature search was first performed to identify genes known to be receptors, transporters or synthetic enzymes of monoamines. A further search was performed to collect cell-level expression data for the monoamine associated genes identified in the previous step. This search was assisted with the curated expression databases of WormBase (Version: WS248; http://www.wormbase.org/) [73] and WormWeb (Version date: 2014-11-16)[74]. A summary of these data is in Supplemental S1–S7 Tables. Neurons expressing multiple receptors for a single monoamine receive a single edge from each sending neuron. Reciprocal connections between nodes are considered as two separate unidirectional connections. Edge lists for individual network are provided in S1 Dataset.Neuropeptide network constructionThe neuropeptide network was constructed from published expression data for peptides and receptors, using an approach similar to that used for the monoamines. Only those systems were included for which sufficient expression and ligand-receptor interaction data existed in the literature, with interactions being limited to those with biologically plausible peptide-receptor EC50 values (Supplemental S8–S10 Tables). In total, 15 neuropeptides and 12 receptors were matched and included in the network. Networks were classified by receptor, allowing a many-to-many relationship between neuropeptides and receptors.Neuron identification & microscopyThe expression patterns of the dopamine receptors were determined using the reporter strains DA1646 lin-15B & lin-15A(n765) X; adEx1646 [lin-15(+) T02E9.3(dop-5)::GFP], BC13771 dpy-5(e907) I; sEX13771 [rCesC24A8.1(dop-6)::GFP + pCeh361], and FQ78 wzIs26 [lgc-53::gfp; lin-15(+)];lin-15B & lin-15A(n765) (kindly provided by Niels Ringstad).The neurons expressing the receptors were identified based on the position and shape of the cell bodies and in most cases co-labelling with other markers. The reporter strains were all crossed with the cholinergic reporter [60] OH13646 pha-1(e2123) III; him-5(e1490) V; otIs544 [cho-1(fosmid)::SL2::mCherry::H2B + pha-1(+)] and the glutamatergic reporter [63]OH13645 pha-1(e2123) III; him-5(e1490) V; otIs518 [eat-4(fosmid)::SL2::mCherry::H2B + pha-1(+)] (both kindly provided by Oliver Hobert), and dye-filled with DiI using standard procedures. Strains were also crossed to AQ3072 ljEx540[cat-1::mcherry] and PT2351 him-5(e1490) V; myEx741 [pdfr-1(3kb)::NLS::RFP + unc-122::GFP], which label cells expressing the vesicular monoamine transporter and the PDFR-1 receptor, respectively. When ambiguous, reporter strains were crossed with additional strains, as listed below.Reporter expression in individual neurons was confirmed with the following crosses:For dop-5:AIM and ADF were confirmed based on coexpression with cat-1. URX, PVC, RIF, RIB, AIY, M5, and DVA were identified based on position and coexpression with cho-1[60]. MI, DVC, ASE (previously identified in [75]) and ADA were confirmed based on position and coexpression with eat-4 [63]. ASI, PHA and PHB were confirmed based on costaining with DiI. PVT, RMG and BDU were identified based on cell body position and shape alone.For dop-6:RIH and ADF were confirmed based on coexpression with cat-1[24]. ASI and PHA were confirmed based on costaining with DiI. AQ3499 ljEx805 [sra-6::mcherry + PRF4] was used to confirm expression in PVQ. AQ3682 ljEx921[flp-8::mcherry + unc-122::gfp] was used to confirm expression in URX and AUA. IL2, RIB, RMD and URA were identified based on position and coexpression with cho-1. AVF was identified based on position and failure to coexpress eat-4 and cho-1. RID was identified based on position relative to URX and morphology.For lgc-53:AIM was confirmed based on coexpression of cat-1. AVF was confirmed based on coexpression with pdfr-1 and failure to coexpress eat-4 and cho-1. URY was confirmed based on position, coexpression with eat-4, and lack of coexpression with ocr-4. AQ3526 ljEx822 [klp-6::mcherry + pRF4] was used to confirm IL2 expression. AQ3535 ljEx828 [unc-4::mcherry + pRF4] was used to confirm VA expression. FLP was confirmed based on position, morphology, and coexpression with eat-4. HSN, CAN and PVD expression were identified based on position and morphology.MicroscopyStrains were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope. Worms were immobilized on 3% agarose pads with 2.5mM levamisole. Image stacks were acquired with the Zen 2010 software and processed with Image J.Topological network measuresEdge counts, adjacency matrices and reducibility clusters were all computed using binary directed versions of the networks. The same networks, excluding self-connections (i.e. setting all diagonal elements to 0), were used to compute all other measures.Network measures are compared to 100 null model networks (shown in the boxplots) generated using the degree-preserving edge swap procedure. This is performed by selecting a pair of edges (A→B) (C→D) and swapping them to give (A→D)(C→B). If the resulting edges already exist in the network, another pair of edges is selected instead. Each edge was swapped 10 times to ensure full randomisation. To compute the multilink motif z-scores, the null model was constructed by randomizing each layer independently.To identify neurons with high-participation in all of the network layers, the normalized degree-rank product was used. This is computed by ranking neurons in each network layer by their degree in descending order, and scaling to the range [0, 1]. The product is then taken of the ranked degrees in each layer. Thus, if a neuron had the highest degree in each of the network layers, it would have a degree product of 1.Clustering coefficientThe measure of clustering described here is the global clustering, also known as transitivity, given in [76–78], which measures the ratio of triangles to triples (where a triple is a single node with edges running to an unordered pair of others, and a triangle is a fully-connected triple). For a directed network, this is equivalent to:
T=∑i∈Nti∑i∈N[(kiout+kiin)(kiout+kiin−1)−2∑j∈NAijAji]
where A is the adjacency matrix, N is the number of nodes, kout and kin are the out-degree and in-degree, and ti is the number of triangles around a node:
ti=12∑j,h∈N(Aij+Aji)(Aih+Ahi)(Ajh+Ahj)Characteristic path lengthTo obtain the characteristic path length of a network, the geodesic (i.e. minimum) distance, d, between each pair of nodes i, j, is first computed:
dij=∑Auv∈g(i,j)Auv
where g(i,j) returns the geodesic path between nodes i and j. The characteristic path length is then given:
L=1n∑i∈N∑j∈N,i≠jdijn−1ModularityThe modularity Q is determined by first subdividing the network into non-overlapping modules c to maximise within-module connectivity and minimise between-module connectivity [79]. The modularity then gives the proportion of edges that connect to nodes within the same module:
Q=1M∑i,j∈N(Aij−kiinkjoutM)δ(ci,cj)
where ci, cj are the modules respectively containing nodes i, j; M is the number of edges, and δ is the Kronecker delta function:
δ(x,y)={1ifx=y0ifx≠yAssortativityThe assortativity of a network is the correlation between the degrees of nodes on either side of a link. This is given by Newman [80] as:
R=M−1∑ij∈Ekioutkjin−[M−1∑ij∈E12(kiout+kjin)]2M−1∑ij∈E12([(kiout)2+(kjin)2])−[M−1∑ij∈E12(kiout+kjin)]2ReducibilityStructural reducibility measures the uniqueness of layers by comparing the relative Von Neumann entropies. The larger the relative entropy, the more distinguishable the layer. Formally, the Von Neumann entropy for a layer is given:
H=−∑iNλi[α]log2⁡λi[α]
where λi[α] are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated to layer A[α]. To visualise layer similarity, hierarchical clustering was performed using the Jensen-Shannon distance [28] and the Ward hierarchical clustering method [81].ReciprocityReciprocity is the fraction of reciprocal edges in the network:
r=|E↔|M
where M is the number of edges, and |E↔| is the number of reciprocal edges:
|E↔|=∑i≠jAijAjiRich-club coefficientThe rich-club phenomenon is the tendency for high-degree nodes in a network to form highly-interconnected communities [40, 82]. Such communities can be identified by creating subnetworks for each degree level k, where nodes with a degree ≤ k are removed, and computing the rich-club coefficient Φ(k) for each subnetwork. This is the ratio of remaining connections Mk to the maximum possible number of connections. For a directed network with no self-connections, where Nk is the number of remaining nodes, this is given by:
Φ(k)=MkNk(Nk−1)Thus, a fully-connected subnetwork at a given degree k has a rich-club coefficient Φ(k) = 1. To normalise the rich-club coefficient, we computed the average values for 100 random networks ⟨Φrandom(k)⟩:
Φnorm(k)=Φ(k)⟨Φrandom(k)⟩We used the same threshold previously used in determining the wired rich-club of C. elegans [11], defining a rich-club to exist where Φnorm(k) ≥ 1 + 1σ, where σ is the Standard Deviation of Φrandom(k).Multilink motifsMultilink motif analysis considers the full range of possible link combinations that can exist between any two nodes across all layers of a network, and is based on the concept of multilink as described in [47, 83, 84]. Due to the conceptual and structural similarity between monoamine layers (see reducibility), we limited our analysis to three layers: synaptic, gap junction, and monoamine (see SI for neuropeptides), giving a total of 20 possible multilink motifs. Instances of each motif were recorded by simultaneously traversing the three network layers. This was also conducted for 100 randomized three-layer networks, generated by rewiring each of the real networks individually using the same randomisation procedure described above. These random networks were used to calculate motif z-scores and p-values for the actual network.SoftwareNetwork measures were computed in MATLAB (v8.5, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox [77] and MATLAB/Octave Networks Toolbox [85]. Reducibility analysis, clustering, and multilayer plots were computed in MuxViz [86]. Reducibility is based on the algorithm described in [28], and layer similarity was visualized using the Ward hierarchical clustering method [81]. Hive plots were generated using the custom hiveplotter function written in Python (Python Software Foundation. Python Language Reference, v3.5). 3-node network motifs were computed using FANMOD [87]. Additional network visualisations were created using Cytoscape [88] and Dia (https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/).Supporting InformationS1 FigTopological properties of additional C. elegans extrasynaptic networks.(A) Multilayer expansion of monoamine subnetworks using the larger (dop-5/6-containing) dopamine network.

The present pharmacological fMRI study investigated episodic memory-related dedifferentiation in young and older adults, and its relation to dopaminergic function, using a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design with the agonist Bromocriptine (1.25 mg) and the antagonist Sulpiride (400 mg). We used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure memory specificity: the degree to which distributed patterns of activity distinguishing two different task contexts during an encoding phase are reinstated during memory retrieval. As predicted, memory specificity was reduced in older adults in prefrontal cortex and in hippocampus, consistent with an impact of neural dedifferentiation on episodic memory representations. There was also a linear age-dependent dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus reflecting a relative boost to memory specificity on Bromocriptine in older adults whose memory was poorer at baseline, and a relative boost on Sulpiride in older better performers, compared to the young. This differed from generalized effects of both agents on task specificity in the encoding phase. The results demonstrate a link between aging, dopaminergic function and dedifferentiation in the hippocampus.Graphical abstractfx1Highlights•We examined memory specificity and its dopaminergic modulation in aging using MVPA.•Task specificity during encoding was age-invariant.•Specificity of episodic reinstatement was reduced in older adults in PFC and hippocampus.•Bromocriptine and Sulpiride modulated these age differences in hippocampus.•Dopaminergic effects in hippocampus in older adults tracked individual performance.KeywordsAgingDedifferentiationEpisodic memoryHippocampusPrefrontal cortexDopamineIntroductionThe dedifferentiation theory of cognitive aging proposes that there is a loss of specificity of neural representations as people become older. These pervasive changes are assumed to impact predominantly on the complex cognitive functions which decline the most (Baltes and Lindenberger, 1997, Li et al., 2001). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed widespread age-related reductions in the specificity of distributed cortical patterns of activity elicited by different categories of visual stimuli (Carp et al., 2010b, Goh et al., 2010, Park et al., 2004) and different actions (Carp et al., 2011). Preliminary evidence also supports the prediction that dedifferentiation impacts on functions and regions which decline prominently in old age: the visual category-specificity of cortical activity patterns correlates with older adults' fluid processing ability, and varies with working memory load in frontal and parietal cortex (Carp et al., 2010a, Park et al., 2010, Payer et al., 2006). However, little is currently known about the mechanisms of dedifferentiation, nor its impact on episodic memory, one of the cognitive functions most affected by aging. We investigated whether memory representations are less specific in older adults and explored the modulation of memory specificity by dopaminergic drugs.Normal aging is accompanied by a marked decline in detailed recollection of events, and an increase in false memory (Schacter et al., 1997, Spencer and Raz, 1995). These episodic memory difficulties are typically attributed to declines in the integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (e.g., Head et al., 2008, Yonelinas et al., 2007). However, regional age-related changes may be secondary to generalized neural changes such as dedifferentiation. The first aim of the present study was to examine whether the specificity of episodic reinstatement differs according to age. Episodic recollection is thought to involve hippocampal reactivation of stored memory traces which represent events' particular sensory and cognitive properties (Alvarez and Squire, 1994, McClelland et al., 1995). Consistent with this, functional imaging studies show that successful episodic memory retrieval is accompanied by reinstatement of cortical activity associated with the original events (Danker and Anderson, 2010). Studies using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have further shown that the specificity of this episodic reinstatement for particular tasks and categories of stimuli varies with strategic memory search and with competition between relevant and irrelevant memories, suggesting that it reflects the specificity of recollection (Kuhl et al., 2011, McDuff et al., 2009). Using MVPA, St-Laurent et al. (2014) recently showed less distinctive cortical reinstatement in older adults for individual items. We examined the specificity of distributed patterns of reinstatement for two different encoding task contexts involving semantic and phonological processing (Johnson et al., 2009, Polyn et al., 2005). We then determined the degree to which distinct task-related activity patterns present during encoding were reinstated during subsequent retrieval, predicting that this measure of memory specificity would be reduced in older relative to younger adults.According to computational models, age-related dedifferentiation may reflect a reduction in dopamine signaling and neural signal-to-noise in prefrontal cortex (PFC; Li et al., 2001), and potentially elsewhere. Modeling dedifferentiation in this way reproduces disruption of episodic binding functions found in older adults (Li et al., 2005). This is in line with wider evidence of a ‘correlative triad’ between aging, cognition and dopamine function (Bäckman et al., 2006). The second aim of the present study was to extend the findings of our previous report, which examined dopaminergic modulations of brain activity associated with successful episodic encoding across the two encoding tasks (Morcom et al., 2010). The study had a cross-over placebo-controlled design, in which we administered a dopamine agonist (Bromocriptine) and an antagonist (Sulpiride) to manipulate dopamine signaling. Morcom et al. (2010) found age-related differences in dopaminergic effects on activity associated with successful episodic encoding in PFC and hippocampus. This dopaminergic sensitivity was most pronounced in the older adults with poorer memory, consistent with the notion that dopaminergic decline impairs the ability to encode new memories. Specifically, there were reversed subsequent memory (subsequent forgetting) effects within MTL in the older group: i.e., encoding phase activity predicted later forgetting rather than remembering (Morcom et al., 2010). We proposed then that older adults may encode less distinctive memory representations which do not support specific recollection (Morcom et al., 2010, Wagner and Davachi, 2001).This novel joint analysis of task-specific activity at encoding and its reinstatement at retrieval allowed us directly to test the link between dopamine, aging and dedifferentiation of episodic memory. We predicted that the expected age-related reduction in memory specificity would vary with changes in dopamine signaling. If dopaminergic decline causes dedifferentiation, loss of memory specificity should be dopamine-sensitive. Predictions about the nature of this sensitivity were derived from the results of the successful encoding study (Morcom et al., 2010) and the dopamine aging hypothesis. First, we expected that dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity would track individual differences in memory ability in the older group, and that poorer older performers would show greater dopamine sensitivity, distinguishing them from the young. Second, we predicted that the dopaminergic effect on memory specificity would parallel that previously reported for the univariate memory encoding (subsequent memory) effects. In addition, if the reversed, subsequent forgetting, effects in the older group reflected impaired memory specificity as proposed by Morcom et al. (2010), then Bromocriptine should reduce memory specificity in poorer older performers just as it enhanced subsequent forgetting effects.MethodsSubjectsSixteen younger (7 female, mean age = 24.9, SD = 4.7 years) and sixteen older adults (9 female, mean age = 66.9, SD = 3.3 years) contributed data. These comprised all subjects from the previous report on the encoding data, as well as 1 young and 3 older subjects who had not provided sufficient data for that event-related analysis, and 1 older participant who contributed data only for the Placebo session. An additional 3 older subjects and 1 young were excluded due to missing Placebo session data (3 with data acquisition or storage issues, 1 withdrew). Therefore, the Placebo condition analyses included 16 young and 16 older subjects, and the drug analyses included samples of 16 and 15. A further older subject was also excluded from analyses of covariance due to an outlier value for the performance covariate, yielding sample sizes of 16 and 14 (see Results: Task specificity and Feature selection, Task specificity and Feature selection). Volunteers were screened on initial telephone contact using a standard questionnaire. The exclusion criteria were a history of any significant psychiatric or physical condition which was likely to affect the brain or cerebral vasculature, current vasoactive or neurotropic medication, and contraindications to the study drugs or to MRI. Each subject also had an electrocardiogram prior to taking part in functional MRI scanning, reviewed by a physician, as well as a structural scan. The groups were matched on years of education (in young, mean = 4.6, SD = 2.6; in old, mean = 4.0, SD = 3.0; t < 1). Estimated verbal IQ using the National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) was slightly higher in the older group as expected (Backman and Nilsson, 1996); for young, mean = 112, SD = 6.0; for old, mean = 118, SD = 6.5, t(34) = 2.96, p = .006; for details see Morcom et al. (2010).Experimental design and taskSubjects took part in 3 experimental sessions in which they received Sulpiride 400 mg, Bromocriptine 1.25 mg, or a Placebo orally, in a randomized double-blind crossover design. The scanned episodic memory task commenced after 3 h, and comprised a study (encoding) phase, followed by 2 test (retrieval) phase blocks. To avoid nausea within the double-blind procedure, the study drug was given with 10 mg of the peripheral dopamine antagonist Domperidone (Reddymasu et al., 2007). Subjects were also asked to eat beforehand. For Sulpiride the mean time to maximal plasma concentration is about 3 h, and it has a plasma half-life of around 12 h, and oral bioavailability of about 35%. Plasma prolactin concentration is maximal after about 1 h, then declines slowly (Wiesel et al., 1982, Von Bahr et al., 1991, Caley and Weber, 1995). Bromocriptine's central effects are also long lasting, though somewhat slower to onset than those of Sulpiride, with measurable effects from as early as 1 1/2 h post-dose which maximal after 3 h and persist for some time (Luciana et al., 1998, Müller et al., 1998, Oranje et al., 2004). fMRI data acquisition began at about 3-h post-dose and the sessions were separated by a minimum washout period of a week. Subjects were randomly allocated to each of 6 possible counterbalanced session orders. After exclusions, there were minor imbalances in session ordering between and across age groups. The main analyses are reported with the full N, but we conducted check analyses to rule out possible confounds of session effects: none were found, and effects were if anything more robust once session ordering was balanced. Details of these check analyses are given in the Supplementary material.Study and test stimuli were 4–9 letter nouns of 1–3 syllables from the CELEX database (http://www.ru.nl/celex/; for details see Morcom et al., 2010). The paradigm is illustrated in Fig. 1. The study phase consisted of 16 “mini-blocks” of 15 trials each. Subjects performed two different orienting tasks, one involving a semantic and one a phonological judgment. Semantic and phonological mini-blocks alternated and each pair was followed by 21 s fixation. This task ordering was counterbalanced across subjects. Semantic mini-blocks were preceded by the cue “Living?” and subjects judged whether each word referred to a living or a non-living thing. Phonological mini-blocks were preceded by the cue “Syllables?”, and subjects judged whether each word had an even or an odd number of syllables. In both tasks half the items were animate and half inanimate, and of each of these, half had an odd and half an even number of syllables. Items were distributed randomly across mini-blocks. Words were shown center-screen in white uppercase Arial font on a black background. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) at study was 3000 ms, with stimuli on screen for 600 ms followed by fixation.Fig. 1Paradigm design. Illustrates the mini-block structure of the study and test phases of the task. Note that not all mini-blocks are shown. See Experimental design and task for details.Fig. 1The test phase consisted of two sessions, each including 18 mini-blocks of 10 trials. The first session immediately followed the study phase (after a brief verbal interaction to prevent rehearsal), followed by the second after an unrelated 6 min task. Subjects were told that in the mini-blocks preceded by the cue, “Remember living”, previously seen items had all been studied in the Living/Non-living task, while in those preceded by “Remember syllable,” they had all been studied in the Syllable task. Two thirds of the items had been studied and a third were new items, distributed randomly across mini-blocks. Subjects judged whether they specifically recollected having studied the word (“Remembered”), whether they thought the word had been studied but it was just familiar (“Know”), or it was unstudied (“New”), using standard “Remember–Know” instructions (Gardiner, 1988). Mini-blocks alternated as at study, with 21 s fixation after each pair. Test phase SOA was 4400 ms, with stimuli on screen for 600 ms followed by fixation.MRI data acquisition and preprocessingFunctional scans were acquired using a 3.0T Medspec S300 MRI system, with a gradient-echo echo planar (EPI) pulse sequence (TR = 1200 ms, TE = 27.5 ms, flip angle = 90°). Each EPI volume comprised 23 interleaved 4 mm thick axial slices angled to the intercommissural line, with a 1 mm inter-slice gap (64 × 64 pixels, in-plane resolution 3.125 mm). One encoding timeseries was acquired in the study phase (755 volumes), and two retrieval timeseries in the test phases (825 volumes each). Seven “dummy” volumes were discarded at the start of each run. Outlier scans (with slices of > 5 standard deviations) were replaced with the mean of the 2 neighboring scans.Initial preprocessing was done in SPM 5 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/). Each timeseries was realigned spatially to the first volume, then normalized using nonlinear basis functions and resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxels, using an EPI template based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference brain (Cocosco et al., 1997) in the space of Talairach and Tournoux (Ashburner and Friston, 1999, Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). No smoothing was performed. Further preprocessing was carried out in MATLAB 7.6 (www.mathworks.com). Linear trends and frequencies below 1/180 Hz were removed from each timeseries using SPM5's high-pass filter function. The timeseries was then normalized and scaled to a range of (− 1,1) to allow for varying ranges of voxel activity using the Princeton MVPA toolbox (Norman et al., 2006, Detre et al., 2006; http://www.pni.princeton.edu/mvpa/).Feature selectionRegions of interest (ROIs) were defined using WFU PickAtlas (http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/). ROIs encompassed lateral PFC (inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG)), bilateral hippocampus, and two areas previously shown to be engaged in episodic encoding during the phonological orienting task (bilateral fusiform gyrus (FusG) and left superior occipital gyrus (LSOG; Otten and Rugg, 2001). Prefrontal ROIs were defined for each hemisphere separately (LIFG, RIFG, LMFG & RMFG), as age-related differences in lateralization of memory function in PFC were of potential interest (Morcom, 2003, Cabeza, 2002). Within each ROI, we used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) feature selection utility in the Princeton toolbox to select voxels showing the most significant differences between the two task conditions (semantic and phonological) in each training (encoding phase) dataset. In order to check whether MVPA results varied according to the threshold used for feature selection, we generated 3 separate feature sets for each training dataset and ROI, comprising the 500, 150 and 50 most significant voxels. For each ROI, the best performing feature set in the Placebo condition ridge regression analysis of task specificity (encoding) effects was then used for all subsequent analyses of memory specificity and drug effects, and for the correlation analysis (see Multi-voxel pattern analysis: age-related differences, Task specificity, Multi-voxel pattern analysis: age-related differences, Task specificity, below).Multi-voxel pattern analysis using ridge regressionWe used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate the specificity of the patterns of neural activity in the semantic and phonological encoding tasks (task specificity), and the specificity with which information encoded using these two tasks was later retrieved (memory specificity). Machine learning algorithms are now widely used to decode neural activity (Polyn et al., 2005, Haynes and Rees, 2006, Kamitani and Tong, 2005). The fidelity with which they can discriminate between two cognitive conditions provides a measure of the distinctiveness of different patterns of neural activation. MVPA measures were computed for each subject and drug condition using the Princeton MVPA toolbox (Norman et al., 2006, Detre et al., 2006; http://www.pni.princeton.edu/mvpa/). We used a penalized ridge regression algorithm because of its sensitivity to intermediate activation values at training and at test, and its ability to compensate for multicollinearity among features (Coutanche et al., 2011, Zhang and Yang, 2003, Poppenk and Norman, 2012). This means that predictions of test set data are continuous rather than binary. To assess the performance of the algorithm for each subject and drug session we calculated the correlation coefficient of its predictions with the labels of the testing set using the inbuilt performance metrics in the Princeton's toolbox, giving test set data values from − 1 to 1 (chance = 0).The first analyses assessed task specificity, i.e., the distinctiveness of neural patterns during the two orienting tasks (semantic and phonological) within the study phase (encoding). Subjects' encoding timeseries were subdivided into 8 equal subsets, each comprising one mini-block. To account for hemodynamic lag the design was convolved with SPM8's canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). A ridge regression algorithm was then trained on 7 of these subsets and tested on the 8th in a leave-one-out cross validation procedure with 8 iterations. Before application of the algorithm to the test data, we ran a nested cross-validation procedure on the training data for the Placebo condition to determine the optimum values for the ridge regression penalty parameter which controls the maximum value of the sum of the squares of the voxel weights (Coutanche et al., 2011). The optimum value within the range (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000) did not differ between age groups (median value across ROIs and selected feature sets in both groups = 50; interquartile range = 130, for Kruskal–Wallis tests in each ROI for selected feature sets, p > .05). These individually determined penalty parameters were employed for all subsequent analyses.Next, we investigated memory specificity in a combined study and test phase (encoding–retrieval) analysis. Memory specificity was defined as the accuracy with which the algorithms trained to discriminate between the encoding tasks were able to predict the retrieval task in each ROI. For this analysis, all 8 pairs of encoding mini-blocks were used as training data, and each retrieval phase's 9 pairs of mini-blocks served as 2 independent test runs. Memory specificity measures were computed for both retrieval phases and the final measure of memory specificity for each subject and drug session was the average performance of the ridge regressor across the two phases. We note that because the encoding and retrieval mini-blocks contained different numbers of trials (15 and 10, see above), this difference could contribute to lower values for memory specificity than for task specificity. However, scan numbers and therefore data points available for the ridge analysis were closely similar between the two phases (37.5 and 36.6). Moreover, an overall difference between levels of task specificity and memory specificity was expected, since they are assumed to reflect very different processes (see Introduction).Multi-voxel pattern analysis using correlation distance metricTo check the reproducibility of the ridge regression results and for comparability with prior studies of dedifferentiation in aging, we also measured memory specificity using a correlation distance metric of neural distinctiveness (Carp et al., 2010b, Haxby et al., 2001). To allow for hemodynamic delay, the fixation scans and the first 7 scans of each mini-block were discarded giving 30 scans from each encoding and retrieval mini-block. Voxel values were then averaged across the remaining scans in each semantic and phonological task mini-block for the study and test phases, and across mini-blocks, and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients computed within and between tasks between the encoding phase and the retrieval phase. Memory specificity was defined as the neural distinctiveness of activity patterns in the two different tasks across the two phases of the episodic memory task. Memory specificity was calculated as the difference between the average correlation within similar tasks (semantic encoding & semantic retrieval and phonological encoding & phonological retrieval) and the average correlation between different tasks (semantic encoding & phonological retrieval and phonological encoding & semantic retrieval).ResultsTask performanceDetailed behavioral analyses of both study and test phases are included in the previous report on the encoding data (Morcom et al., 2010). The pattern of findings was unchanged in this larger sample. Performance on the two orienting tasks in the study phase did not differ according to age group or drug condition, and both groups were highly accurate (90% for young, 89% for old). In the test phase, the main index of memory performance was the discrimination index Pr for hits and false alarms, collapsed over Remember and Know responses (Phit − Pfalse alarm, Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988). Pr did not differ between age groups on Placebo (t < 1), but there was a main effect of drug with a linear trend (F(1.8, 53.6) = 3.29, p = 0.049; F(1,29) = 4.26, p = .048), mainly reflecting a reduction in Pr on Sulpiride across both groups (mean = 0.43) relative to Placebo and Bromocriptine (means = 0.47;). As in the previously reported sub-group of subjects, although this effect did not interact with age (F(1.8, 53.6) = 1.33), it was driven mainly by a reliable linear effect of drug in the older group taken alone. (Response bias, as indexed with Br (Pfalse alarm / 1 − (Phit − Pfalse alarm), (Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988)), was also more liberal on Sulpiride (mean = 0.46; for Placebo and Bromocriptine, means = 0.38 and 0.41; values > 0.5 indicate a relatively liberal bias to respond “old”). Valid recollection and familiarity measures were available for a subset of 16 young and 13 older adults; these did not show reliable drug or group effects. In addition, the depth of processing effect (better memory following semantic than phonological encoding; Craik and Lockhart, 1972) did not differ between groups (mean probability of recollection = .53 and .28 in the young respectively, and .50 and .27 in the older group; age effects n.s.) or as a result of the pharmacological manipulation.Multi-voxel pattern analysis: age-related differencesTask specificityEncoding phase task specificity in the Placebo condition was assessed using ridge regression, and the results were also used to determine the optimal feature set size for each ROI for the memory specificity and drug analyses (see Methods: Feature selection). Results for all feature sets are given in Inline Supplementary Table S1. Cross-validation showed that the ridge algorithm accurately discriminated between the semantic and phonological orienting tasks in all ROIs and individual subjects (p < 0.01 for all). Average ridge accuracy across ROIs and feature sets was 0.78 in both the young and the older group (individual values ranged in the young group from 0.47 in hippocampus to 0.98 in LIFG; in the older group, from 0.61 in hippocampus to 0.97 in LIFG).Encoding phase task specificity in the Placebo condition was assessed using ridge regression, and the results were also used to determine the optimal feature set size for each ROI for the memory specificity and drug analyses (see Methods: Feature selection). Results for all feature sets are given in Inline Supplementary Table S1. Cross-validation showed that the ridge algorithm accurately discriminated between the semantic and phonological orienting tasks in all ROIs and individual subjects (p < 0.01 for all). Average ridge accuracy across ROIs and feature sets was 0.78 in both the young and the older group (individual values ranged in the young group from 0.47 in hippocampus to 0.98 in LIFG; in the older group, from 0.61 in hippocampus to 0.97 in LIFG).Inline Supplementary Table S1Table S1Task specificity (study phase) under Placebo (ridge regression).

Ridge accuracy was better for larger feature sets in PFC, and this did not differ according to age. Therefore the 500 voxel feature sets were selected for memory specificity and drug analyses for these ROIs. In HC, task specificity did not differ according to age and was greatest for the smaller feature sets, so these were used for further analyses. In LSOG, the intermediate feature sets of 150 voxels were selected to balance for the slight (but non-significant) increase in task specificity with # voxels in the older group, and decrease in the young. In FusG, the 150 voxel feature set was selected, in which task specificity was maximal and equivalent across age groups.We also tested for associations between encoding phase task specificity and individual differences in performance in the selected feature sets using ANCOVA with covariates of mean-corrected Pr (see Results: Task performance for definition) and the interaction of Pr x group (one older subject was excluded from these analyses due to an outlier Pr value, > 2.5 SD from the mean). These used Pr on Placebo as the covariate. These showed no associations in IFG or MFG (max F = 1.11). In posterior ROIs, behavioral associations were not reliable. Marginally significant main effects of Pr in HC and FusG (p = .089; p = .063) reflected trends for task specificity to be greater in better performers across both age groups; such trends could not complicate the interpretation of any age-related differences in memory specificity or in dopaminergic drug effects.Memory specificityThe results of the encoding–retrieval memory specificity analysis for the Placebo condition are illustrated in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. For each ROI, ridge regression MVPA measures of memory specificity for the selected feature sets were subjected to ANOVA with the factor of age group. Further analyses with the additional factor of hemisphere tested for lateralization differences where group differences were apparent in one ROI. We then tested for brain–behavior associations using ANCOVA with the additional covariates of Pr (on Placebo) and Pr x group (see Task specificity and Feature selection, Task specificity and Feature selection). Where covariate effects were present, we checked that these remained significant when individual age was also included in the model, to rule out potential confounds between performance- and age-related effects within groups (Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001). Except where noted, this was the case. Following ridge analyses, we conducted replication analyses using the correlation distance metric to assess consistency of results across MVPA metrics. These are reported where there were positive findings from the ridge analysis. In summary, consistent age-related differences in memory specificity were found in left PFC (LIFG and LMFG) and in hippocampus.Fig. 2Age-related differences in memory specificity (Placebo session). ROIs are overlaid on the T1 MNI template from MRIcron (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/; sections at x = 30, y = 18, z = 12). A.

Best fit regression lines of memory specificity to Baseline Pr within each age group and drug condition are also shown (note that although raw Pr values are given here, ANCOVA analyses used within-group mean corrected Pr values; see Results). B. The bar graph shows mean memory specificity for each age group and drug condition. Error bars represent the within-group standard errors.Fig. 3Prefrontal cortexIn LIFG, memory specificity assessed with ridge regression was reduced in the older group relative to the young (F(1,30) = 9.09, p = 0.005; for replication with correlation distance metric (F(1,30) = 15.80; p < 0.001). In the older group, memory specificity was not significantly greater than chance. In RIFG, group differences were not reliable (F < 1), but effects did not vary significantly by hemisphere (for interaction with group, F(1,30) = 1.48, p = 0.233). Direct comparison with encoding phase neural specificity measures also confirmed that the age-related reduction in memory specificity was significantly greater than (non-significant) group differences in task specificity at encoding (for group x task phase, F(1,27) = 5.12, p = 0.032). ANCOVA showed no brain–behavior associations in LIFG. In RIFG, there was an association between memory specificity and memory performance across groups (for ridge, F(1,27) = 4.39, p = 0.049; for correlation, F(1,27) = 6.65, p = 0.017), although significance was reduced with age in the model, for ridge, F(1,26) = 1.92, n.s.; for correlation, F(1,26) = 5.86, p = 0.023). Analysis across task specificity and memory specificity ridge regression measures showed that this association with performance was common to both, as reflected in a significant main effect of Pr (F(1,27) = 5.02, p = 0.017; for task x Pr, F(1,27) = 1.73, n.s.).Ridge analysis for left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG), as in LIFG, revealed a group difference in memory specificity favoring the young (F(1,30) = 7.08, p = 0.012; for replication analysis with correlation, F(1,30) = 8.74, p = 0.006), with ridge accuracy again at chance in the older group. As in LIFG, direct comparison confirmed that the group difference was driven by memory specificity relative to encoding phase task-specificity (for task phase main effect, F(1,30) = 7.94, p = 0.008). In RMFG, as in RIFG, group differences were not significant (F(1,30) = 1.2, n.s.), but laterality analysis did not show reliable age-related differences by hemisphere. Brain–behavior analysis in MFG did not reveal any significant findings.Because the correlation measure of neural distinctiveness is a function of correlations both within and between tasks, age differences in memory specificity could be driven by effects on within-task correlations, between-task correlations, or both (see Carp et al., 2010b). Post hoc tests in PFC showed that both within-task and between-task correlation effects contributed to the group differences in LIFG (main effect of group for within- F(1,30) = 12.8 p = 0.001; for between-, F(1,30) = 13.1, p = 0.001) and in LMFG (for within-, F(1,30) = 9.3 p = 0.005; for between-, F(1,30) = 15.2, p < 0.001).HippocampusIn HC, ridge analysis showed reduced memory specificity in the older group (F(1,30) = 6.50, p = 0.016). There was also a positive association between memory specificity and memory performance (for Pr, F(1,27) = 8.77, p = 0.006) and a marginal age-related difference in this association (for group x Pr, F(1,27) = 3.12, p = 0.089). The presence of robust group differences in the association between memory specificity and memory performance was confirmed by a direct comparison between task specificity at encoding (for which brain–behavior associations were non-significant; see last section) and memory specificity. This revealed a significant interaction between task phase, group and Pr (F(1,27) = 4.59, p = 0.041). Correlation analysis replicated the interaction of group with memory performance (for group x Pr, F(1,26) = 6.17, p = 0.019). In the young only, memory specificity was robust for both measures (F(1,14) = 10.93, p = 0.005 for ridge; F(1,15) = 5.75, for correlation, p = 0.030) and was positively associated with performance (F(1,14) = 10.86, p = 0.005 for ridge; F(1,14) = 9.71, p = 0.008 for correlation).Posterior cortexThere were no reliable age-related differences in memory specificity in the posterior ROIs on Placebo. In FusG, ridge analysis did not show reliable age-related differences in memory specificity (F(1,30) = 2.57, p = 0.119), nor significant brain–behavior associations (for Pr, F(1,27) = 4.01, p = 0.056; for group x Pr, F(1,27) = 3.82, p = 0.062). As in RIFG, analysis across neural specificity measures for both task phases showed a positive overall relation with individual performance across age groups (for Pr main effect, F(1,27) = 6.23, p = 0.019; for interaction with task phase, F = 1.23).In LSOG, memory specificity was age-invariant (for group, F < 1) and robust across age groups (for intercept across age groups F(1,30) = 38.73, p < 0.001 for ridge, F(1,30) = 28.43, p < 0.001 for correlation). It did not vary with individual memory performance (F < 1 for Pr effects).Multi-voxel pattern analysis: dopaminergic drug effectsEncoding phase: task specificityThere was a pronounced age-invariant dopaminergic modulation of the ridge measure of task specificity in all ROIs (see Table 1; for drug, min F = 22.68, max p < 0.001; for group x drug, max F = 1.11, min p = 0.335). In both age groups, task specificity was increased by both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine relative to Placebo (for pairwise contrasts, all p < 0.001). However, no age-dependent dopaminergic effects were observed. The drugs did not modulate brain–behavior relations.Table 1Drug effects on encoding phase task specificity (ridge regression).

The correlation analysis replicated the interaction of group with drug and Pr (F(2.0,50.9) = 4.66, p = 0.014). Critically, as for the baseline age-related effects, direct comparison between the ridge neural specificity measures in the two task phases showed that the age-dependent modulation of memory specificity was distinct from the age-invariant modulation of encoding phase task specificity described above for HC and in the other ROIs (for task phase x drug x group x Pr, F(1.6,42.8) = 5.66, p = 0.010).Post hoc tests in the young revealed dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity regardless of performance (for drug, F(1.6,22.2) = 4.42, p = 0.031), with a quadratic trend reflecting reduction in memory specificity on both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine relative to Placebo (F(1,14) = 8.02, p = 0.013). This group also showed a dopamine-insensitive positive relation between memory specificity and memory performance (for Pr main effect, F(1,14) = 8.16, p = 0.013; for drug x Pr, F = 2.32, p = 0.130). In the older group, drug effects varied according to individual differences in memory performance (for drug x Pr, F(1.7,20.7) = 6.96, p = 0.006 for ridge and F(1.8,21.6) = 6.90, p = 0.006 for replication with correlation metric), with a clear linear trend from the Sulpiride through Placebo to the Bromocriptine condition (F(1,12) = 10.62, p = 0.007 for ridge, F(1,12) = 15.05, p = 0.002 for correlation).Within the older group, this memory specificity effect also differed reliably from any drug effects on encoding phase task specificity (for task phase x drug x Pr, F(1.8,22.0) = 5.01, p = 0.018). The only discrepancy between the ridge and correlation indices of memory specificity was that although both showed a strong linear trend, the ridge measure suggested a predominant Bromocriptine effect (see Fig. 3; for pairwise comparison with Placebo for drug x Pr, F(1,12) = 12.63, p = 0.004 for ridge; F(1,12) = 1.53, p = 0.240 for correlation), while the correlation metric suggested a predominant Sulpiride effect (F(1,12) = 6.62, p = 0.024 for correlation; F < 1 for ridge). While on Placebo memory specificity did not vary with performance in the older group (F < 1 for both measures), Bromocriptine induced a more negative association between memory specificity and performance, with memory specificity increasing in poorer performers and decreasing in better performers within the older group (for Pr effect on Bromocriptine F(1,12) = 7.56, p = 0.018 for ridge; F(1,12) = 1.24, p = 0.288 for correlation). Sulpiride had the opposite effect, inducting a more positive association of memory specificity and Pr (F(1,12) = 3.27, p = 0.096 for ridge, F(1,12) = 11.01, p = 0.006 for correlation).Post hoc tests were also conducted with individual linear drug effects on memory specificity as the dependent measure (on Bromocriptine–Sulpiride). These confirmed reliable interactions of age group and Pr (for ridge, F(1,26) = 11.77, p = .022; for correlation, F(1,26) = 6.55, p = .017). Analyses of the relations between linear performance effects (Pr on Bromocriptine–Sulpiride) and linear drug effects did not reveal any significant effects (F < 1 for all).DiscussionOur results show that contextual reinstatement during episodic memory retrieval is less specific in older adults, as predicted by the dedifferentiation account of cognitive aging (Carp et al., 2010b, Li et al., 2001, Park et al., 2004). The data support the proposal that age-related dedifferentiation impacts on episodic memory and impairs memory specificity (Li et al., 2005, St-Laurent et al., 2014). In both young and older age groups, highly specific distributed patterns of neural activity distinguished the processing of semantic and phonological task contexts during the encoding phase, but reinstatement of these task-related patterns at retrieval – memory specificity – was reduced in the older adults in PFC and hippocampus. This reduction in the distinctiveness of retrieved representations was not accounted for by age-related differences in the specificity with which the original task contexts were represented. Task specificity and memory specificity also showed dissociable dopaminergic sensitivity with age-invariant and age-dependent effects, respectively. In hippocampus, memory specificity varied linearly with dopamine stimulation in the older group and this modulation tracked individual differences in memory performance. The dopaminergic effect in hippocampus was distinct from a generalized age-invariant increase in task specificity on both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine. Our data support the notion that dopaminergic function in old age impacts hippocampal memory processes (Chowdhury et al., 2012, Kaasinen et al., 2000, Morcom et al., 2010, Stemmelin et al., 2000, Wilson et al., 2006).Findings in hippocampus under Placebo were as predicted. The robust reinstatement of task-specific activity during episodic retrieval in the young group is consistent with recent reports that elements of specific memory traces within the hippocampus are reactivated during recollection (Chadwick et al., 2011, Staresina et al., 2012; but see Ritchey et al., 2013), although at the current spatial resolution activity in adjacent cortical regions cannot be excluded. Hippocampal reinstatement was not detectable in the older adults, even though distinctiveness of the original two task contexts was, if anything, slightly greater in this group. This is the first report of an age-related reduction in memory specificity in hippocampus and the first to use trial-unique stimuli, converging with recent findings in cortical regions for reinstatement at the level of individual items (St-Laurent et al., 2014). Models of hippocampal function specify that it is critical for the pattern separation of distinct memory traces for highly similar events and their later reinstatement by pattern completion (Marr, 1982, O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994, Treves and Rolls, 1994), functions which appear to be compromised in aging (Wilson et al., 2006, Yassa et al., 2011).It is important to note that the group difference in neural memory specificity did not reflect a simple absence of recollection in the older adults: recollective experience was just as likely in this group, and received the same boost from semantic as opposed to phonological processing. Instead, the findings indicate a reduction in the distinctiveness of reinstatement assumed to support contextual recollection (Danker and Anderson, 2010, St-Laurent et al., 2014). Recovery of episodic detail is typically impoverished in older adults even when subjective recollection occurs (e.g. Levine et al., 2002). Our findings indicate that the decline in recollection of episodic detail in old age (Schacter et al., 1997, Spencer and Raz, 1995) is accompanied by a reduction in the distinctiveness of contextual representations. The data suggest an age-related reduction in the specificity of hippocampal encoding, storage and/or retrieval of these representations which impacts on their later reinstatement during recollection.Age-related reductions in memory specificity in left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC were prominent while memory specificity was age-invariant in LSOG. However, the data do not necessarily suggest selective anterior changes as predicted by the frontal aging hypothesis (West, 1996): although group differences were not clear cut in fusiform gyrus, memory specificity in that region was numerically greater in the young and non-significant in the older adults, consistent with other studies (Carp et al., 2010a, Carp et al., 2010b, Carp et al., 2011, Goh et al., 2010, Park et al., 2010, Park et al., 2012, St-Laurent et al., 2014). Critically, as in hippocampus, the group differences in cortical memory specificity were task-dependent: representations of task context in the encoding phase were well-differentiated in both age groups, unlike contextual reinstatement. It is fundamental to the neural dedifferentiation hypothesis that less differentiated representations be able to explain the marked age-related declines in higher-order functions, notably fluid intelligence, processing speed and – as examined in the present study – episodic memory (Li et al., 2001). Our results support this proposal, as do recent demonstrations of associations between neural category-specificity in older adults and fluid processing (Park et al., 2010), working memory load (Carp et al., 2010a), and episodic memory rather than perception (St-Laurent et al., 2014). In terms of brain–behavior relations, the present study also shows for the first time an association between an index of representation specificity and task performance which is age-dependent. This is consistent with the assumption of the dedifferentiation account that declines in specificity accounts of age-related cognitive change.The results of our psychopharmacological manipulation provide some support for the theory that a decline in dopamine transmission underpins age-related dedifferentiation (Li et al., 2001). In hippocampus, Sulpiride induced greater memory specificity in older adults whose memory was better at baseline (on Placebo) relative to those whose memory was poorer. The resulting brain–behavior association for the group as a whole on Sulpiride resembled that in the young on Placebo. Conversely, Bromocriptine induced a negative association of memory specificity and memory performance in the older group, boosting memory specificity in poorer relative to better performers (see Fig. 3). This partially supports our first prediction, and our prior findings (Morcom et al., 2010), indicating an association between dopaminergic-sensitivity of memory processing and individual memory ability in older adults only. However this association did not involve just a greater sensitivity in poorer performers, but a varying pattern of response according to baseline level of performance. While consistent with the dopamine hypothesis of aging, this does not fit the simple view that dopaminergic decline both reduces memory performance and increases dopamine sensitivity via a single mechanism. This result is considered in more detail below. The finding of an age- and individual performance-related dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal memory specificity, and the findings of Morcom et al. (2010), are also in line with recent behavioral genetics data which implicate individual differences in dopamine receptor and transporter genotypes in individual differences in episodic memory in later life (Li et al., 2013, Papenberg et al., 2013, Papenberg et al., 2014).As noted in the Introduction, we previously found that encoding phase activity in the older group in MTL predicted later forgetting rather than remembering, and proposed that older adults may encode less distinctive memory representations which may not support specific recollection (Morcom et al., 2010). This is consistent with the current findings under Placebo. However, the dopaminergic effects in the present study suggest a need for modification of our previous account of the subsequent forgetting effects. This predicts that an intervention which enhances the subsequent forgetting effects would also tend to reduce memory specificity. However, Bromocriptine increased memory specificity in older adults with poorer memory at the same time as enhancing subsequent forgetting effects (see Fig. 3). The latter effects may instead reflect a form of “partial compensation”, which may improve subsequent memory specificity when it is engaged but may be engaged only when there has been some underlying loss of memory function (Daselaar and Cabeza, 2005, de Chastelaine et al., 2011, Morcom and Johnson, in press). This would be in keeping with the linear increase in memory performance in the older group with the increase in dopamine signaling, alongside the subsequent forgetting effects in the older group, i.e., association of activity in this region with unsuccessful encoding (although the behavioral effect did not vary reliably with individual differences in performance).The dopaminergic modulation of distributed task-specific activity in the encoding phase was unexpected, with age-invariant increases under both Sulpiride and Bromocriptine. There were no accompanying behavioral effects on the phonological and semantic decisions, although the age-invariant Sulpiride effect on decision criterion in the memory task may reflect neuromodulatory mechanisms also affecting processing during one or both of the two orienting tasks. The task specificity measure was included as a baseline for the memory specificity measure, and likely reflected a range of linguistic, mnemonic and executive processes engaged in the two tasks. In pharmacological neuroimaging, nonspecific effects of drugs such as modulations of cerebral blood flow are a potential concern (Honey and Bullmore, 2004). These seem unlikely to account for highly process-specific effects such as those on memory specificity, but might contribute to the widespread effects on task specificity. Whatever the nature of the latter effect, the critical point for interpretation of the episodic memory findings is that the age-dependent dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus differed clearly from the age-invariant effects on task specificity. The performance-related drug effects in the older group only are consistent with the literature suggesting age-related changes in dopaminergic neuromodulation and reveal a greater general sensitivity to perturbations in dopamine signaling than in the young.Our current and earlier investigations converge to support the possibility that age-related memory impairment is associated with an imbalance in hippocampal dopaminergic regulation. Older adults were more sensitive to dopaminergic perturbation than the young: D2-like blockade was associated with improved memory function (greater hippocampal memory specificity) in better older performers and D2-like stimulation with improved function in poorer performers. A hippocampal locus of this effect is consistent with associations of aging and age-related memory decline with loss of dopamine neurons and D2-like receptors in this region (Kaasinen et al., 2000) (Stemmelin et al., 2000). Dopamine regulates hippocampal function by modulation of its cortical inputs, directly via CA1 (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1998) and indirectly via entorhinal cortex (Pralong and Jones, 1993, Caruana, 2006). Thus the direction of effects may depend on cortical inputs as well as baseline function (Fujishiro et al., 2005, Umegaki et al., 2001). Behavioral and neuroimaging investigations in humans have found that D2-like modulation can enhance or impair cognitive function according to baseline function (e.g., Mehta et al., 2005, Mehta et al., 2008, Reeves et al., 2010), consistent with the literature on inverted U functions in PFC (see Cools and D'Esposito, 2011) and their alteration in aging (Mattay et al., 2006), as well as with the present data.Given the systemic dopaminergic manipulation, however, it is also possible that upstream effects – for example in striatum – can explain the MTL responses (Honey and Bullmore, 2004, Morcom et al., 2010). We found no evidence that the age-related differences in memory specificity in PFC were mediated by changes in dopaminergic transmission (Braver et al., 2001, Li et al., 2001). However, this null finding requires cautious interpretation. Future studies should investigate the possibility that the critical age changes mediating memory dedifferentiation in lateral PFC involve D1-like receptors which are numerous in this region (Bäckman et al., 2011). Whether or not cortical dopaminergic decline impacts on episodic memory, our findings in MTL are at least a marker of dopaminergic dysregulation, and hint that it may be possible to improve this regulation by adjusting dopamine signaling. Future studies are needed to establish the behavioral as well as the neural impact of such adjustments.ReferencesAlvarezP.SquireL.R.Memory consolidation and the medial temporal-lobe — a simple network modelProc.

Genome-wide differential gene expression analysis (18,863 probes) resulted in a p value for each gene in each study. A Bayesian method identified the largest p-value threshold (q = .025) associated with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance.ResultsA total of 165 genes were differentially expressed in both studies with concordant direction of fold change. The 90 genes overexpressed (or UP genes) in MDD were significantly enriched for immune response to infection, were concentrated in a module of the gene coexpression network associated with innate immunity, and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In contrast, the 75 genes underexpressed (or DOWN genes) in MDD were associated with the adaptive immune response and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in T cells, natural killer cells, and erythroblasts. Consistently, the MDD patients with overexpression of UP genes also had underexpression of DOWN genes (correlation > .70 in both studies).ConclusionsMDD was replicably associated with proinflammatory activation of the peripheral innate immune system, coupled with relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system, indicating the potential of transcriptional biomarkers for immunological stratification of patients with depression.KeywordsAffymetrixBayesianBiomarkerInflammationSystemsTranscriptomeDepression and inflammation are often associated with one another. Depressive symptoms in a large population sample were significantly related to blood concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP; odds ratio ∼1.8 for depressive symptoms in people with CRP > 3 mg/L vs. CRP < 1 mg/L) (1). Multiple case-control studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported increased peripheral blood concentrations of CRP (Cohen’s d ∼0.50) and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (d ∼0.50) and tumor necrosis factor (d ∼0.40) in MDD 2, 3. The prevalence of comorbid depression is increased in many nonpsychiatric inflammatory disorders (4).There is growing evidence for a causal effect of inflammation on depression. Peripheral inflammation precedes the emergence of depressive symptoms in longitudinal epidemiological studies (5) and in about 30% of patients receiving proinflammatory interferon-α treatment for hepatitis C 6, 7. Experimental challenge with peripheral proinflammatory stimuli in animals robustly induces a syndrome of illness behavior and anhedonia that approximates depressive symptoms (8). Peripheral immune cells and cytokines are known to mediate signals across the blood-brain barrier by several mechanisms (9). Activation of microglia can locally amplify the effects of even a weak peripheral proinflammatory signal on neuronal function and behavior (10).These observations suggest that pharmacological disruption of peripheral proinflammatory signals could be therapeutically effective, at least for a subgroup of patients with depression. However, it is most unlikely that any single anti-inflammatory drug will prove to be superior to all existing treatments for all patients (11). Only about a third of patients with depression have biological evidence for peripheral inflammation [e.g., CRP > 3 mg/L (12)], and an anti-inflammatory drug seems likely a priori to be most effective for an inflamed subgroup of patients with depression. There are many markers of the peripheral immune system that can be conveniently measured in venous blood samples from patients with depression, including cytokines, CRP, and other proteins; cell counts from flow cytometry; and gene transcription (13).Transcriptional (messenger RNA [mRNA]) biomarkers have the potential advantages of assay stability (compared with cytokines) and target specificity (compared with cell counts). However, previous case-control studies of peripheral blood gene expression and MDD have been inconsistent 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (Supplemental Table S1). To date, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (14) is the largest single case-control study of the peripheral blood transcriptome in MDD (882 current patients with MDD, 635 remitted patients with MDD, and 331 control subjects). The NESDA reported statistically significant (false discovery rate [FDR] = 10%) differential expression of 129 genes enriched for interleukin 6 and natural killer (NK) cell signaling pathways (19).We were primarily motivated by the hypothesis that MDD is associated with peripheral blood transcriptional markers of innate immune system activation 8, 20. We were also concerned to focus on results that were more likely to replicate across case-control studies of gene expression in MDD. We report Affymetrix microarray data on 18,863 probes from two independently designed and conducted case-control studies of MDD. We used a Bayesian method to identify genes that were differentially expressed in both studies. Focusing on a consensus set of 165 genes, we investigated the functional significance of the genes that were differentially (over- or under-) expressed in cases compared with controls. We also explored the secondary hypothesis that innate immune system activation is coupled to relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system in patients with MDD 21, 22, 23.Methods and MaterialsSamplesWe analyzed data from two case-control studies of depression: the GlaxoSmithKline–High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program (GSK–HiTDiP) study and the Janssen–Brain Resource Company (Janssen–BRC) study. Other aspects of these studies have been previously reported 24, 25, 26, 27, 28; demographic and clinical details on the samples are provided in Supplemental Table S2.GSK–HiTDiPThis study was designed primarily to test for an association between genetic (DNA) variation and diagnosis of depression. Minimal sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, but microarray data were available for analysis (after quality control) from whole-blood samples stored for less than 6 years on a sample comprising 113 patients with MDD prospectively balanced for comorbid anxiety disorder [57 with generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (29) and 56 without anxiety disorder] and 57 healthy control subjects. All participants provided informed consent in writing. The study was approved by an independent ethics review board.Janssen–BRCThis study was designed primarily for biomarker discovery. Microarray data were available for analysis (after quality control) from whole-blood samples stored for less than 1 year on a sample comprising 94 patients with MDD (40 with generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed post hoc by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and 54 without anxiety disorder) and 100 healthy control subjects. Additional data on melancholic symptom severity, anxiety, substance use, and body mass index (BMI) were available for patients with MDD. All participants provided informed consent in writing. The study was approved by an independent ethics review board.Whole-blood samples from both studies were analyzed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array. We applied identical quality control, normalizing, and annotation algorithms to the two datasets, resulting in the estimation of mRNA expression at each of 18,863 unique probes for each participant.Differential Expression AnalysisTo determine differential gene expression between cases and controls, we adopted the same strategy for both studies; see Supplemental Figure S1 for a schematic overview of the data analysis strategy. For each gene i = 1, …, 18,863, we fitted a linear regression model that included group (coded Gr; two-level factor, case/control), batch (B; two-level factor, 1/2), gender (Ge; two-level factor, male/female), age (Ag; continuous), and presence/absence of anxiety (An; two-level factor, 0/1) as covariates. Denoting samples by j = 1, …, n and the design matrix by X, the model is(1)yij=βi0+∑k=12βikGrxjkGr+∑l=12βilBxjlB+∑m=12βimGexjmGe+βiAgxjAg+∑r=12βirAnxjrAn+εi,where εi ∼ N(0, σi2). For identifiability, we imposed the contrasts βi1Gr=βi1B=βi1Ge=βi1An=0 on model parameters. The model was fitted using the R package limma (30). Subsequently, we tested the null hypothesis Hi0: βi2Gr = 0; that is, there is no difference in expression of the ith gene between the two groups using the moderated t statistic (31). For each of the 18,863 probes in each study, the p value was generated using the asymptotic approximate distribution (and also nonparametrically by a permutation algorithm; see Supplemental Tables S3 and S4).Combining p Values for Differential Gene Expression From Two StudiesTo identify MDD-related genes that were replicated in both the GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC datasets, we set the p-value threshold for significance of differential expression of each gene in each study to optimize in some sense the number of genes that were differentially expressed in both studies compared with the number of coincidental differences expected by chance. To do this, we used the method of Blangiardo and Richardson (32), implemented in the R package sdef (33), and specified the p-value threshold as q2, which represents the largest (most lenient) p value < .05 for which there are at least twice as many significant case-control differences in common between the two studies as expected by chance.Gene Coexpression Network AnalysisWe used weighted gene correlation network analysis (34) to construct a normative coexpression network in which nodes represent genes and weighted edges represent correlations between the expression of pairs of genes in healthy control subjects (34). To maximize the amount of data available for this estimation, and to ensure that the resulting network was representative of both studies, we included the healthy control data from both the GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC studies (N = 157 in total). We used the consensus weighted gene correlation network analysis method to construct a weighted undirected graph that could be decomposed into a set of modules of strongly coexpressed genes (34). Eigengenes were used to test for case-control differences in the gene expression profile on average within each module of the normative weighted gene correlation network analysis transcriptome (Supplemental Table S11).Gene Ontology Enrichment AnalysisWe performed enrichment analysis for various gene lists such as the list of genes differentially expressed in both studies and the list of genes comprising each module of the coexpression network. We used the R package topGO (35) to determine whether these lists were significantly enriched for specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms (36) using a stringent Bonferroni correction (q < .05) for multiple comparisons across all 10,124 terms, resulting in a p-value threshold of 4.94 × 10−6.Protein–Protein Interaction MappingWe used the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins [http://string-db.org
(37)] to determine the network of known protein–protein interactions among the genes differentially expressed in both studies (38).Cell Type–Specific Gene Expression AnalysisWe investigated the genes differentially expressed in both studies in relation to a third independent microarray (Affymetrix) dataset designed to examine cell type–specific expression patterns (39). In particular, we focused on the expression of MDD-related genes across 37 sorted cell samples of the following immune cell types: erythroblasts (8 samples), monocytes (6 samples), monocyte-derived dendritic cells (5 samples), neutrophils (3 samples), B cells (4 samples), CD4+ T cells (5 samples), CD8+ T cells (5 samples), and NK cells (6 samples). We used the BioLayout Express3D software 40, 41 to visualize clusters or subgroups of genes that shared similar patterns of expression across different cell types.ResultsCombining Differential Expression Across Two Case-Control Studies of MDDSeparate differential expression analyses of the GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC datasets yielded two lists of p values for the same set of 18,863 gene expression probes (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4). The Bayesian method identified q2 = .0246 as the largest p value threshold associated with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance. At this threshold, 173 genes were differentially expressed in both studies. We further refined this gene list by restricting attention to the 165 consensus genes (95%) that showed the same direction of overexpression (UP) or underexpression (DOWN) in the two case-control studies (Supplemental Table S5).These findings were corroborated by Fisher’s chi-square test for combining p values, which identified 393 genes that were differentially expressed in both studies with FDR = 10%, of which 146 were included in the list of replicably, concordantly, differentially expressed genes defined by Bayesian analysis (Supplemental Table S6).Furthermore, the set of 165 replicably concordant genes (henceforth the MDD-165 consensus set) was partially corroborated by the prior results of the NESDA case-control study (14). Considering the 15,830 genes that were measured by the microarrays used in all three studies (NESDA, Janssen–BRC, and GSK–HiTDiP), 150 of the MDD-165 consensus set were included, of which 7 genes (CD247, PRKCH, PGLYRP1, NFATC2, ST6GAL1, MAPK14, and MTSS1) were also differentially expressed, with the same sign of fold change, in the NESDA study at FDR = 5%. When the FDR threshold for the NESDA study was relaxed to 10% and 20%, 18 and 45 of the 150 genes differentially expressed in both the GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC studies, respectively, were also differentially expressed in the NESDA study (Supplemental Table S5). By comparison, we expect by chance to find 1.95, 8.30, and 30.40 genes in common with the NESDA study at FDR thresholds of 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. In contrast, there was less overlap between the MDD-165 consensus set and the top 29 most significantly differentially expressed genes reported in another large case-control study of MDD (16); only SRSF5 was underexpressed in both of these lists.To assess the robustness of our results to key modeling assumptions, we conducted two sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the analysis using a model for differential expression that did not include comorbid anxiety as an explanatory factor. Only 24 genes were identified by Bayesian analysis as significantly coexpressed; of these 24 genes, 21 were concordant for sign of fold change, and 15 of these 21 genes were also included in the MDD-165 consensus set (Supplement). The reduced sensitivity when not adjusting for anxiety likely reflects the importance of refining or homogenizing the clinical phenotype in the search for biomarkers. Second, we repeated the analysis using a model for differential expression that included BMI as a covariate. BMI was not measured in the GSK–HiTDiP study, so this analysis was restricted to 74 patients and 80 control subjects from the Janssen–BRC dataset. Inclusion of BMI in the model tended to increase the p values for MDD-related differences, and only 73 genes in the MDD-165 consensus set were differentially expressed at the probability threshold q2 = .0246 (Supplemental Figure S3). The reduced sensitivity of the analysis including BMI as a covariate likely reflects the known proinflammatory effect of obesity and the reduced sample size available.Gene Set Enrichment Analyses Across GO TermsWe conducted a series of enrichment analyses to functionally characterize the MDD-165 consensus set. The top 10 most significantly enriched GO terms all were related to the immune response to infection (Bonferroni q < .05 for the top 9 terms) (Supplemental Table S7). Among the MDD-165 consensus set, 90 genes were overexpressed in cases compared with controls. The UP gene list was significantly enriched for GO terms related to the innate immune system and response to infection (Bonferroni q < .05 for the top 17 terms) (Table 1). In addition, 75 genes were significantly underexpressed in cases compared with controls. As we hypothesized based on prior literature (19), this gene list was enriched for GO terms related to the adaptive immune system (p ≤ 10−3 for top 20 GO terms; Table 1), but there was no significant enrichment of the DOWN genes at the more stringent Bonferroni threshold.Table 1Enrichment Analysis of the MDD-165 Consensus Set of Genes That Were Differentially Overexpressed (UP) or Underexpressed (DOWN) in Patients With MDD Compared With Healthy Control Subjects in Both GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC StudiesRankGO:IDTermAnnotatedFoundExpectedFisher’s TestOverexpressed UP (Innate Immunity)1GO:0009617Response to bacterium405192.297.7e-132GO:0042742Defense response to bacterium164130.937.0e-123GO:0043207Response to external biotic stimulus651203.693.7e-104GO:0051707Response to other organism651203.693.7e-105GO:0009607Response to biotic stimulus680203.858.0e-106GO:0002376Immune system process21493512.179.8e-107GO:0006955Immune response1310267.426.3e-098GO:0098542Defense response to other organism351141.999.1e-099GO:0051704Multi-organism process21763212.329.2e-0810GO:0050832Defense response to fungus2150.129.7e-0811GO:0032496Response to lipopolysaccharide253111.431.7e-0712GO:0002237Response to molecule of bacterial origin265111.52.8e-0713GO:0006952Defense response1372247.773.2e-0714GO:0009605Response to external stimulus19472911.023.8e-0715GO:0045087Innate immune response820184.645.5e-0716GO:0009620Response to fungus3450.191.3e-0617GO:0019731Antibacterial humoral response2340.137.8e-0618GO:0031640Killing of cells of other organism2540.141.1e-0519GO:0044364Disruption of cells of other organism2540.141.1e-0520GO:0019730Antimicrobial humoral response2740.151.5e-05Underexpressed DOWN (Adaptive Immunity)1GO:0050851Antigen receptor-mediated signaling path13350.590.000292GO:0046649Lymphocyte activation53292.340.00053GO:0009059Macromolecule biosynthetic process43363219.090.000524GO:0034645Cellular macromolecule biosynthetic proc41833118.420.000645GO:0010557Positive regulation of macromolecule bio1361155.990.000666GO:0032774RNA biosynthetic process32752614.420.000867GO:0046631Alpha-beta T cell activation9940.440.000948GO:0016070RNA metabolic process38732917.060.000959GO:0050776Regulation of immune response721103.180.0011210GO:0006351Transcription, DNA-templated31612513.920.0012211GO:0097659Nucleic acid-templated transcription31772513.990.0013112GO:0042110T cell activation38271.680.001413GO:0070489T cell aggregation38271.680.001414GO:0071593Lymphocyte aggregation38471.690.0014415GO:0031328Positive regulation of cellular biosyn1470156.470.0014716GO:0002562Somatic diversification of immune recept5230.230.0015417GO:0016444Somatic cell DNA recombination5230.230.0015418GO:0070486Leukocyte aggregation39071.720.0015819GO:0045893Positive regulation of transcription, DN1178135.190.0016120GO:1903508Positive regulation of nucleic acid-temp1178135.190.00161The top 20 GO terms for biological processes are ranked according to their p values by Fisher’s exact test for significant enrichment. Bonferroni correction specifies a p-value threshold of p = 4.94 × 10−6 to achieve significance at q < 0.05. Such a correction is well known to be too stringent given that many of the GO terms are correlated; however, the top 17 terms were significantly enriched in the overexpressed UP gene set after Bonferroni correction.GO, Gene Ontology; GSK–HiTDiP, GlaxoSmithKline–High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program; Janssen–BRC, Janssen–Brain Resource Company; MDD, major depressive disorder; MDD-165 consensus set, set of 165 replicably concordant genes.Protein Interaction and Whole-Genome Transcriptional Network AnalysesWe used Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins analysis (37) to visualize the network of protein–protein interactions between the proteins coded by the MDD-165 consensus set. These genes were significantly enriched for protein–protein interactions (permutation test, p = 7 × 10−4) that were concentrated around mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which thus can be regarded as the most highly interactive hubs of this immune signaling network (Figure 1). Many of the proteins in this network are coded by genes that were independently identified by the NESDA study as differentially expressed in MDD; see Figure 1.Figure 1Protein–protein interaction network for proteins coded by the set of 165 replicably concordant genes differentially expressed in both case-control studies of major depressive disorder. The network is represented by an undirected graph where links correspond to known protein–protein interactions and weights are proportional to the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins confidence score (38). Only high-confidence (>0.7) links are retained, and disconnected genes are not shown. Red (blue) nodes correspond to genes over- (under-) expressed in major depressive disorder in both the GlaxoSmithKline–High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program and Janssen–Brain Resource Company datasets. Smaller inner circles highlight proteins that are coded by genes also differentially expressed and with the same sign of fold change in a third large independent case-control study of major depressive disorder (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety [NESDA]) (14) thresholded to control false discovery rate (FDR) at 20% (white circles), 10% (gray circles), and 5% (black circles).We constructed a graph representing significant coexpression of a pair of genes (nodes) as an edge drawn between them. As previously reported (42), this whole-genome transcriptional network or transcriptome had complex topological properties, including a community structure comprising modules of coexpressed genes enriched for specific GO terms (Figure 2). The UP genes were concentrated in the normative module (red) significantly enriched for innate immune response GO terms (e.g., myeloid cell activation involved in immune response, q = 5 × 10−5, Bonferroni corrected), whereas the DOWN genes were concentrated in a normative module (pink) specialized for translation-based terms (Figure 2). We confirmed in a hypothesis-driven analysis that the module associated with DOWN gene expression was also significantly enriched for adaptive immune response terms (e.g., T-cell differentiation, p = .0002). There were significant case-control differences in eigengene scores summarizing expression of all genes within modules enriched for innate immune response (red, p = .031; yellow, p = .015), translation (pink, p = .002), and one additional module with no significant enrichment terms (tan, p = .025); see Supplemental Table S11.Figure 2Major depressive disorder (MDD)-related genes in the context of the normative whole-genome transcriptome. Overexpressed genes (or UP genes) in patients with MDD are concentrated in a module of the normative gene coexpression network specialized for innate immune response, whereas underexpressed genes (or DOWN genes) are concentrated in a module partially specialized for adaptive immune response. (A) The modules of the normative transcriptome are highlighted in different colors. (B) The MDD-related genes are colored according to their normative module affiliation, and representative genes are text-labeled. (C) The MDD-related genes are colored green for overexpressed (or UP) genes and are colored red for underexpressed (or DOWN) genes.

Remarkably, 89 of the 90 UP genes formed four clusters of gene coexpression, three of which represented strong overexpression of a subset of UP genes in one or two myeloid cell classes (Figure 3). Likewise, 71 of the 75 DOWN genes formed two clusters of gene coexpression, each representing cell-specific overexpression of a subset of DOWN genes in one or two lymphoid or erythroblast classes (Figure 3).Figure 3Cell class–specific expression patterns for the set of 165 replicably concordant genes. We estimated the correlation between each possible pair of the 165 major depressive disorder (MDD)-related genes and identified clusters of genes with similar expression patterns in an independent microarray dataset on specific cell types. The set of 165 replicably concordant genes formed six clusters, with each cluster comprising a subset of genes that had strong mutual coexpression across a range of eight distinct cell classes: erythroblasts, monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), neutrophils, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. (A) The six clusters of genes with strongly correlated expression profiles. Clusters 1 to 4 (left) comprised genes that were overexpressed in MDD (or UP genes), and clusters 5 and 6 (right) comprised genes that were underexpressed in MDD (or DOWN genes).

In both studies, UP and DOWN expression scores were strongly negatively correlated (Figure 4), indicating that these case-control differences were coupled at the level of individual patients (Janssen–BRC: r = −.82, p < 10−4; GSK–HiTDiP: r = −.74, p < 10−4).Figure 4Opposing and coordinated expression of innate and adaptive immune transcripts in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). (A, B) Scatter plots for the mean expression across the 75 underexpressed (DOWN) genes plotted against the mean expression of 90 overexpressed (UP) genes in the Janssen–Brain Resource Company (Janssen–BRC) (A) and GlaxoSmithKline–High-Throughput Disease-specific target Identification Program (GSK–HiTDiP) (B) datasets. Each point corresponds to a patient. Blue indicates case, and gray indicates control (CTL). Regression lines are shown in blue and gray, respectively. In (A), an individual patient’s data point (red outline) is projected onto the regression line (red circle). The distance from the origin to the point on the regression line is the bioscalar value for that patient. Inset illustrates the projection (black) of all individual patient data points (blue) onto the sample regression line. (C, D) Left panels: Box plot of MDD-165 bioscalar values in controls and cases. Green line indicates the threshold identifying the top third (tertile) of the MDD-165 bioscalar distribution as a subgroup of inflamed patients with MDD (designated immune-MDD).

(E) Correlation of each depressed patient’s MDD-165 bioscalar with body mass index (BMI). (F, G) Box plots of MDD-165 bioscalar for subgroups defined by a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety disorder. AUC, area under the curve.Given the strong linear relationship between UP and DOWN gene expression in patients with MDD, we mapped each patient’s data to a point on the fitted regression line, thereby characterizing each patient by a bioscalar that locates it on a single axis or dimension of coupled UP/DOWN gene expression; see Figure 4A (inset). As expected, there were significant case-control differences in the MDD-165 bioscalar in both studies (Cohen’s d = 0.68 for GSK–HiTDiP and 0.58 for Janssen–BRC, corresponding to a medium effect size; Figure 4C, D), with patients on average having more positive values, indicating a greater shift in the direction of coupled innate activation and adaptive inactivation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that cases and controls were classified with an area under the curve of 0.71 for the GSK–HiTDiP study and an area under the curve of 0.67 for the Janssen–BRC study (Figure 4C, D). This moderately accurate classification performance reflects the fact that the bioscalar distributions of cases and controls are overlapping. We also assessed the performance of the bioscalar not to discriminate cases from controls (which is ultimately a clinical diagnostic decision) but rather to identify the top third “most inflamed” patients with MDD. To do this, we defined a cutoff value for the bioscalar corresponding to the top tertile critical value of its distribution in each study (0.57). Participants with MDD-165 > 0.57 were classified correctly as belonging to such an inflamed MDD subgroup (sensitivity = 100% by definition) with a high specificity (93% and 88% in GSK–HiTDiP and Janssen–BRC studies, respectively).We provisionally explored correlations between the MDD-165 bioscalar and sociodemographic or clinical differences among the patients with MDD in the Janssen–BRC study. BMI (r72 = .20, p = .099), the CORE total score for melancholic symptom severity (r88 = .18, p = .097), and the presence or absence of comorbid substance abuse disorder (two-tailed t63 = 1.9, p = .07) were not significantly associated with bioscalar scores. There was a significant difference in bioscalar scores between subgroups of patients with MDD with or without comorbid anxiety disorder (t83 = −2.4, p = .02).DiscussionWe have reported the differential expression analysis of whole-genome microarray data from two independent case-control studies of patients with MDD compared with healthy control subjects. Using Bayesian methods, we identified a set of 165 consensus genes that were replicably associated with MDD, sharing the same direction of fold change in the cases compared with controls in both studies. The robustness of these results was further supported by comparison with the results of the largest prior case-control microarray study of depression, the NESDA study (14); several genes differentially expressed in the NESDA study were likewise differentially expressed in these data, for example, MAPK14 and MMP9. Both of these genes were consistently overexpressed in patients with MDD and both code proteins (MAPK14 and matrix metallopeptidase 9) that were hubs of a network of interactions between immune signaling proteins coded by many of the other differentially expressed genes. A MAPK14 inhibitor has been tried for treatment of major depression but did not demonstrate consistently significant effects on symptom rating scales compared with placebo at the single dose tested (43).The consensus set of 165 genes associated with MDD was divided into two approximately equal-sized subsets; here, 90 so-called UP genes were overexpressed in patients and 75 so-called DOWN genes were underexpressed in patients. The overexpressed UP genes were significantly enriched for GO terms related to the response to infection and the innate immune system. These gene transcripts were not functionally unrelated to or independent of each other. Most UP genes were affiliated with the module of the normative gene transcriptional network specialized for innate immune response. Smaller clusters of highly correlated UP genes were typically enriched in neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These results are compatible with prior data implicating activation of the innate immune system and increased proinflammatory cytokine signaling in (some people with) depression 8, 20.In contrast, we found that the underexpressed DOWN genes were enriched for GO terms related to T-cell function and adaptive immunity. The DOWN genes were affiliated with modules of the transcriptome partially specialized for adaptive immune function, and smaller clusters of strongly coexpressed DOWN genes were enriched in T cells, B cells, and NK cells. These results are compatible with prior data implicating relative suppression of the cellular immune system in (some people with) depression, including evidence for decreased NK cell cytotoxicity and decreased proliferation of lymphocytes challenged with mitogens in vitro (44), and with recent data suggesting that deficiencies of NK and T cells co-occur with inflammatory monocyte activation as related phenomena in the same patients with MDD 21, 22, 45, 46.In both studies, we also observed a strong statistical association between mean UP gene overexpression and mean DOWN gene underexpression in each patient. This provided robust evidence that these complementary immunophenotypes are indeed coupled at the level of an individual patient. It also motivated the concept that each individual patient may be located by a single number (bioscalar) on a spectrum of coupled change in innate and adaptive immune system function. Patients with MDD had significantly higher scores on this bioscalar, indicating a mean shift to relatively increased UP gene expression and decreased DOWN gene expression. The subgroup of most-inflamed patients with MDD, defined as the top tertile of the MDD-165 bioscalar distribution, were identified with high sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that this may in the future prove to be a useful biomarker for defining an abnormally inflamed subgroup of patients with MDD.So far, we have used the terms overexpression and underexpression simply to describe higher and lower levels of measured mRNA in cases compared with controls. At least three (mutually nonexclusive) explanatory factors are plausible: cellular, genetic, and environmental. First, case-control differences in expression could reflect differences in cell counts. For example, increased monocyte counts have been reported in MDD (47) and could cause apparent overexpression of innate immune system genes measured in whole-blood samples (and relative underexpression of adaptive immune genes). It will be important in the future to combine cytometry and transcriptional measurements in the same patients and to measure case-control expression differences in sorted cell samples. Second, mRNA changes could be quantitative traits determined by DNA variation at expression quantitative trait loci. This genetic explanation would require that (at least some) patients with MDD had a consistent profile of allelic variation in inflammation-related genes (48), but large genome-wide association studies have so far failed to identify genetic variants robustly linked to risk for major depression (49). The absence of significant genome-wide association study findings in MDD could be regarded as problematic for an expression quantitative trait locus interpretation of expression changes, or it could be discounted on the grounds that classically designed association studies were underpowered to detect DNA variations occurring in only a subgroup of immunologically dysfunctional patients. Third, gene expression changes could have been induced in patients by exposure to some shared environmental stimulus. The risk for depression is associated with adverse events in the biological and social environments such as infection, childhood abuse, and bereavement (50). In addition, psychosocial stress has been linked to peripheral immune state changes, such as increased proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte activation (51), that are compatible with overexpression of innate immune system genes.It is a methodological limitation that the GSK–HiTDiP study, designed primarily to identify risk genes for MDD, did not provide data on severity of depressive symptoms or BMI. The case-control comparisons are not controlled for potentially confounding effects of cigarette smoking, race, comorbid medical disease, or socioeconomic status on peripheral immune status. Future studies of transcriptional biomarkers in MDD, with more detailed clinical and immunological phenotyping and more complete control of potential confounds, will be required to evaluate the generalizability of these results.In short, we have reported replicable new evidence in support of peripheral immune gene expression markers for MDD. It may be fruitful in the future to investigate coupled overexpression of innate immune genes and underexpression of adaptive immune genes as a predictor of antidepressant response to novel immunotherapeutics.References1Wium-AndersenM.K.ØrstedD.D.NielsenS.F.NordestgaardB.G.Elevated C-reactive protein levels, psychological distress, and depression in 73,131 individualsJAMA Psychiatry702013176184232665382ValkanovaV.EbmeierK.P.AllanC.L.CRP, IL-6 and depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studiesJ Affect Disord1502013736744238704253HaapakoskiR.MathieuJ.EbmeierK.P.AleniusH.KivimakiM.Cumulative meta-analysis of interleukins 6 and 1β, tumour necrosis factor α and C-reactive protein in patients with major depressive disorderBrain Behav Immun492015206215260658254MatchamF.RaynerL.SteerS.HotopfM.The prevalence of depression in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysisRheumatology52201321362148240032495KhandakerG.M.PearsonR.M.ZammitS.LewisG.JonesP.B.Association of serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein in childhood with depression and psychosis in young adult life: A population-based longitudinal studyJAMA Psychiatry71201411211128251338716BullS.J.Huezo-DiazP.BinderE.B.CubellsJ.F.RanjithG.MaddockC.Functional polymorphisms in the interleukin-6 and serotonin transporter genes, and depression and fatigue induced by interferon-α and ribavirin treatmentMol Psychiatry14200910951104184586777HepgulN.CattaneoA.AgarwalK.BaraldiS.BorsiniA.BufalinoC.Transcriptomics in interferon-α-treated patients identifies inflammation-, neuroplasticity- and oxidative stress-related signatures as predictors and correlates of depressionNeuropsychopharmacology41201625022511270671288DantzerR.O’ConnorJ.FreundG.JohnsonR.KelleyK.From inflammation to sickness and depression: When the immune system subjugates the brainNat Rev Neurosci920084656180737759BanksW.A.KastinA.J.GutierrezE.G.Penetration of interleukin-6 across the murine blood-brain barrierNeurosci Lett17919945356784562410PerryV.H.CunninghamC.HolmesC.Systemic infections and inflammation affect chronic neurodegenerationNat Rev Immunol720071611671722091511MillerA.H.RaisonC.L.Are anti-inflammatory therapies viable treatments for psychiatric disorders?

We introduce a new technique for cortical network mapping based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional coexpression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ.

A common, functional variant in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala; rs2228145 A > C) is known to dampen down inflammation by impairing IL6R signaling. We have examined the association of Asp358Ala with diagnosis of depression and psychosis, serum IL-6, CRP levels, and a number of risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis. We predicted that if IL-6 were related to depression/psychosis risk causally, rather than due to confounding, Asp358Ala would be associated with risk of these disorders, serum IL-6, CRP levels, but not with any of the confounders.MethodWe used data from the population-based ALSPAC birth cohort. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were measured at age 9 years. Psychotic disorder, ICD-10 diagnosis of severe depressive episode, and total depression score were assessed at age 18 years. IL6R Asp358Ala was genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform. Risk factors assessed include sex, body mass index, social class, ethnicity, maternal education, birth weight, gestational age, maternal post-natal depression, childhood psychological and behavioral problems, and total IQ score.ResultsAsp358Ala was associated with decreased risk of severe depression and/or psychosis; adjusted odds ratio for those with CC, compared with AA, genotype was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15–0.94). The variant was associated with increased serum IL-6 levels (P = 5.5 × 10−22) but decreased serum CRP levels (P = 3.5 × 10−5), consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect downstream of IL-6. Asp358Ala was not associated with total depression score. Asp358Ala was not associated with any of the other risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis (all P > 0.20).ConclusionsThe findings provide further evidence that the IL-6/IL6R pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and psychosis, and may be novel therapeutic targets. Previously reported associations between IL-6, depression and psychosis are unlikely to be fully explained by confounding. Based on a small number of cases, findings from the current study need replication in other samples.AbbreviationsALSPAC, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Birth CohortCHD, Coronary Heart DiseaseCIS-R, Clinical Interview Schedule RevisedCRP, C-Reactive ProteinELISA, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent AssayEPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression ScaleGWAS, Genome Wide Association StudyICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, 10th revisionIL-6, Interleukin 6IL6R, Interleukin 6 ReceptorIL6R, Interleukin 6 Receptor GeneIQ, Intelligence QuotientPLIKSi, Psychosis-Like Symptom InterviewRCT, Randomised Controlled TrialSCAN, Schedules for Clinical Assessment in NeuropsychiatrySDQ, Strengths and Difficulties QuestionnaireSNP, Single Nucleotide PolymorphismWISC III, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd editionKeywordsInterleukin 6IL-6Interleukin 6 receptorIL6RInterleukin 6 receptor geneIL6RAsp358Alars2228145InflammationDepressionPsychosisMendelian randomizationImmunopsychiatryALSPAC birth cohort1IntroductionExperimental, clinical and epidemiological studies indicate that inflammatory cytokines may contribute to pathogenesis of depression and psychosis, of which interleukin 6 (IL-6) is one of the leading candidates. Injecting mice with IL-6, which controls serotonin transporter levels and consequently serotonin reuptake (Kong et al., 2015), leads to depression-like behaviour (Sukoff Rizzo et al., 2012). Inhibiting circulating IL-6 with a monoclonal antibody prevents depression-like behaviour in mice following exposure to stress (Hodes et al., 2014). In healthy volunteers, inflammation-induced mood deterioration and associated changes in the subgenual cingulate activity and mesolimbic connectivity are mediated by circulating IL-6 levels (Harrison et al., 2009). In patients with depression (Dowlati et al., 2010, Goldsmith et al., 2016, Haapakoski et al., 2015, Howren et al., 2009) and psychosis (Miller et al., 2011, Miller et al., 2013, Potvin et al., 2008, Upthegrove et al., 2014) who are acutely unwell, concentrations of IL-6 and other inflammatory markers are elevated compared with controls, which tend to normalize after recovery but continue to be elevated in treatment resistant patients (Goldsmith et al., 2016, Maes et al., 1997, O'Brien et al., 2007). Treatment with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor (IL6R) may improve symptoms of depression (Kappelmann et al., 2016) and schizophrenia (Miller et al., 2016).Epidemiological studies based on prospective cohorts suggest, higher IL-6 levels are associated with cognitive symptoms of depression (Gimeno et al., 2009) and depression severity subsequently (Khandaker et al., 2014). Our work based on a population-based prospective birth cohort indicates that higher levels of IL-6 in childhood at age 9 years are associated with increased risks of developing depressive and psychotic symptoms subsequently in early-adulthood at age 18 years in a linear, dose-response fashion (Khandaker et al., 2014). Elevated IL-6 levels in childhood are also associated with persistent depressive symptoms subsequently during the second decade of life (Khandaker et al., 2017). Confounding is an important alternative explanation for epidemiological observations. Although evidence for associations between IL-6, depression and psychosis remained after controlling for a number of potential confounders, residual confounding from unmeasured factors still might account for these associations.We have carried out a targeted genetic association analysis to examine whether association between serum IL-6 levels, depression and psychosis are consistent with a causal role of inflammation in these disorders or whether these associations could be explained by confounding (see below). To this end, we have focused on a common, functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala; rs2228145 A > C; formerly known as rs8192284), which is known to regulate IL-6 bioactivity. Cell-based experiments have previously shown that the minor 358Ala allele decreases inflammatory activity by reducing surface expression of IL6R on CD4 + T lymphocytes and monocytes, which results in decreased responsiveness of cells to IL-6 (Ferreira et al., 2013, Reich et al., 2007). The variant is associated with higher levels of IL-6 but lower levels of CRP, and is protective for a number of physical illnesses associated with inflammation such as coronary heart disease (CHD) (Collaboration et al., 2012, Swerdlow et al., 2012) and type-1 diabetes (Ferreira et al., 2013). The variant is also associated with decreased risk of schizophrenia (Kapelski et al., 2015). However, to our knowledge no study has examined the association between Asp358Ala and depression. Furthermore, associations between Asp358Ala and circulating IL-6 and CRP levels have been observed in adults (Collaboration et al., 2012), but we are not aware of any studies examining these associations in childhood.Based on findings from previous studies, we hypothesized that Asp358Ala would be associated with elevated serum IL-6 but decreased serum CRP levels at age 9 years, and with decreased risks of depression and psychosis at age 18 years in the ALSPAC birth cohort. We also examined the relationship between Asp358Ala and a number of risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis (e.g., age, sex, social class, ethnicity, body mass index, IQ). If the variant were associated with IL-6, CRP, depression, and psychosis, but not with the confounders, this would indicate that the variant affects psychiatric risk by altering levels of inflammation. This would also indicate that previously reported associations between IL-6, depression and psychosis are unlikely to be fully explained by confounding (see discussion). In addition to using depression as continuous measure, we examined risk of severe depression defined according to ICD-10 criteria (WHO, 1992). This is because focusing on severe illness can increase the likelihood of detecting genetic associations for depression by reducing phenotypic heterogeneity (Converge Consortium, 2015). We also calculated risk of severe depression and/or psychosis; we considered severe depression and psychosis together due to their phenotypic and aetiological overlap (see discussion), and to increase statistical power.2Materials and methods2.1Description of cohort and sampleThe ALSPAC birth cohort comprises 14,062 live births from pregnant women resident in county Avon, a geographically defined region in southwest of England, with expected dates of delivery between April 1991 and December 1992 (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/). Parents completed regular postal questionnaires about all aspects of their child’s health and development from birth. Since age 7, the children attended an annual assessment clinic during which they participated in various face-to-face interviews and physical tests. Samples sizes for the associations examined vary because assessments for IL6R genotype, serum IL-6 concentration at 9 years, serum CRP concentration at 9 years, depression at 18 years, and psychosis at 18 years were completed on different numbers of participants. We used the maximum available data to test each association (see Tables).2.2Assessments of depression at age 18 yearsThe computerised version of the Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (CIS-R) was self-administered by cohort participants in assessment clinics at average age 17.8 years (SD = 0.38). The CIS-R is a widely used, standardized tool for measuring common mental disorders in large community samples (Lewis et al., 1992). In the UK, CIS-R has been used in National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a household survey on 10,000 individuals representative of the UK population, in 1993 and 2007 (Jenkins et al., 1997, Spiers et al., 2011). The CIS-R is a fully structured assessment, suitable for trained social survey interviewers and does not require any expert knowledge on the part of the interviewers. As such, it can also be administered using personal computers in which the subjects self-complete the questionnaire (Lewis, 1994).The CIS-R elicits responses to 14 symptoms of depression experienced in past week, and provides a diagnosis of depression according to ICD-10 criteria. We used severe depressive episode defined according to ICD-10 criteria as the main outcome. In addition, we used CIS-R total depression score as a continuous outcome measure. Total depression score ranged from zero to 21, which was calculated by summing symptom scores for depression, depressive thoughts, fatigue, concentration, and sleep problems.2.3Assessments of psychotic disorder at age 18 yearsPsychotic symptoms were identified through the face-to-face, semi-structured Psychosis-Like Symptom Interview (PLIKSi) conducted by trained psychology graduates in assessment clinics, and were coded according to the definitions and rating rules for the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) (WHO, 1994). The PLIKSi has good inter-rater and test-retest reliability (both kappa = 0.8) (Zammit et al., 2013). Psychotic symptoms covering the three main domains of ‘positive’ psychotic symptoms occurring since age 12 were elicited: hallucinations (visual, auditory); delusions (spied on, persecution, thoughts read, reference, control, grandiosity, other); thought interference (insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting). After cross-questioning, interviewers rated symptoms as not present, suspected, or definitely psychotic. For suspected or definite symptoms, interviewers also recorded frequency; impact on affect, social function, educational/ occupational function; help seeking; and attributions, such as fever, hypnopompic/ hypnogogic state, or drugs. Based on these data, an operational definition of psychotic disorder was created as the presence of definite psychotic symptoms not attributable to the effects of sleep/fever, and where the symptom: (1) occurred at least once per month over the past six months, and, (2) caused severe distress, or had a very negative impact on social/occupational function, or led to help-seeking from a professional source (Zammit et al., 2013).2.4Measurement of serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations at age 9 yearsBlood samples were collected at non-fasting state at average age 9.9 years (SD = 0.32), immediately spun and frozen at −80 °C. Inflammatory markers were assayed in 2008 after a median of 7.5 years in storage with no previous freeze-thaw cycles during this period. IL-6 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D systems, UK), and high sensitivity CRP by automated particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche UK). All inter-assay coefficients of variation were <5%. The minimum detection limit for IL-6 was 0.007 pg/mL, and that for CRP was 0.01 mg/L. This represents the lowest measureable analytic level that can be distinguished from zero. In the total sample with valid inflammatory marker data at age 9 years, IL-6 values ranged from 0.007 to 20.051 pg/mL (N = 5076), and CRP values ranged from 0.01 to 67.44 mg/L (N = 5086).2.5IL6R SNP selection and genotypingThe study focused on a specific functional genetic variant (Asp358Ala; rs2228145) because it is well characterised with regards to its effect on IL6R signaling. Asp358Ala impairs classic IL6R signaling, and hence, dampen inflammation by reducing membrane bound IL6R levels (Ferreira et al., 2013). Previous studies have reported associations between Asp358Ala (or variants closely linked with it) and circulating inflammatory markers (Collaboration et al., 2012, Reich et al., 2007), CHD (Collaboration et al., 2012, Swerdlow et al., 2012), and auto-immune diseases such as type-1 diabetes (Ferreira et al., 2013). In total, 9912 unselected participants from the ALSPAC birth cohort were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform by 23 and Me subcontracting the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK and the Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, USA. After extensive quality control, high quality genotype data were available from 8355 participants (84% of those genotyped); rs2228145 was directly genotyped on the array. The variant was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (observed frequencies for the common homozygotes (AA), heterozygotes (AC), and rare homozygotes (CC) genotypes were 2892, 4000 and 1463, respectively; Chi-squared = 1.55; df = 1; P = 0.213). We re-examined the association of rs2228145 with severe depression and psychosis by excluding participants who were related (identity-by-descent/ IBD cut off = 0.05).2.6Assessment of potential confoundersFor each variable, age of assessment and available sample size used to examine association with Asp358Ala have been presented in the results section. Briefly, birth weight, gestational age and sex were recorded at birth. Body mass index (weight in kg divided by height in meter squared) was assessed around blood collection for IL-6 assay. Age at psychiatric assessment for depression and psychosis at 18 years was recorded in months. As per the UK Office of National Statistics classification system, father’s social class was recorded in six categories: I, II, III non-manual, III manual, IV, V (in descending order with professionals and higher managerial workers representing social class I). Mother’s highest educational achievement was recorded in four groups (secondary school, vocational qualification, O level, A level, degree). Ethnicity was coded as a categorical variable with the British White group comprising 97.4% of the sample. Mother’s postnatal depression was measured by the self-report Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale administered at 8 weeks postpartum (Cox et al., 1987). IQ was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC III, 3rd UK edition) at age 8 years (Wechsler et al., 1992). Mothers completed the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the study child was 7 years old. The SDQ is an age appropriate, valid and reliable tool for measuring psychological and behavioural problems in young children (Goodman, 1997).2.7Statistical analysisWe used logistic regression to examine the relationship between IL6R genotype and the outcomes of severe depression, psychosis, and severe depression and/or psychosis, coded as binary variable. Odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome were calculated for participants with AC and CC genotype, compared with AA genotype. The regression models were adjusted for sex, body mass index, ethnicity, father’s social class, and mother’s highest educational qualification. We used linear regression to examine the relationship between CIS-R total depression score (continuous variable) and IL6R genotype. In addition, we used one-way analysis of variance to compare mean total depression score among three groups defined according to IL6R genotype. We used independent sample Kruskal Wallis test to compare distributions of total depression scores among these groups.The association between IL6R genotype and serum IL-6, CRP concentrations (natural log-transformed values) was examined using linear regression. For the associations between IL6R genotype and psychiatric risk factors: one-way analysis of variance and linear regression were was used for continuous variable (age, birth weight, gestational age, body mass index, mother’s Edinburgh postnatal depression score at 8 weeks postpartum, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total difficulties score at 7 years, child’s total Wechsler IQ score at 8 years). Chi-squared test was used for categorical variable (sex, ethnicity, father’s social class, mother’s education).3Results3.1Association between IL6R genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A>C), severe depression and psychosisThe minor allele frequency of Asp358Ala was 41% based on 8355 participants from the ALSPAC birth cohort. Analysis for the association between Asp358Ala and severe depression and/or psychosis at age 18 years were based on 3251 participants. The sample included 79 cases of severe depression and/or psychosis (see below for further information). Risk of severe depression and/or psychosis decreased in a linear fashion for each copy of the minor allele 358Ala; rs2228145 [C] (Fig. 1). The OR for severe depression and/or psychosis in those with the CC genotype compared with those with the AA genotype was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.13–0.76); P-value = 0.010, which remained statistically significant after adjusting for sex, body mass index, ethnicity, father’s social class, and mother’s highest educational level (Table 1). The OR for linear trend for association between IL6R genotype and severe depression and/or psychosis also remained statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounders; adjusted OR = 0.65 (95% CI, 0.44–0.95); P-value = 0.026. Analyses for the association of Asp358Ala with severe depression and psychosis as separate outcomes were based on 3406 and 3521 participants respectively. These analyses revealed similar results indicating a protective effect of the CC genotype although confidence intervals for the ORs became wider and included the null.Fig. 1Cases of Severe Depression and Psychosis at Age 18 Years Grouped by IL6R Genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A > C).Table 1The Odds Ratios for Severe Depression and/or Psychosis at Age 18 Years in the ALSPAC Birth Cohort for the IL6R Genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A > C).GenotypeSampleCase, No. (%)Odds Ratio (95% CI)UnadjustedAdjusted1Severe Depression and/or PsychosisA/A112736 (3.2)1 [reference]1 [reference]A/C154837 (2.4)0.74 (0.47–1.18)0.70 (0.41–1.20)C/C5766 (1.0)0.32 (0.13–0.76)0.38 (0.15–0.94)Linear trend325179 (2.4)0.63 (0.45–0.88)0.65 (0.44–0.95)  Severe DepressionA/A117619 (1.6)1 [reference]1 [reference]A/C162114 (0.9)0.53 (0.26–1.06)0.57 (0.26–1.24)C/C6015 (0.8)0.50 (0.18–1.35)0.59 (0.21–1.66)Linear trend340638 (1.1)0.64 (0.40–1.05)0.71 (0.43–1.19)  PsychosisA/A122020 (1.6)1 [reference]1 [reference]A/C166929 (1.7)1.06 (0.59–1.88)1.09 (0.55–2.17)C/C6325 (0.8)0.47 (0.18–1.28)0.38 (0.11–1.35)Linear trend352154 (1.5)0.79 (0.53–1.17)0.75 (0.47–1.20)1ORs have been adjusted for sex, body mass index, ethnicity, father’s social class, and mother’s highest education.Out of 3251 participants with data on IL6R genotype and diagnosis of severe depression and/or psychosis, 173 were related (IBD cut off = 0.05). Sensitivity analysis after removing these participants showed results similar to the main analysis. The OR for severe depression and/or psychosis in those with the CC genotype compared with those with the AA genotype was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14–0.82); P-value = 0.016. Evidence for this association attenuated after adjusting for sex, body mass index, ethnicity, father’s social class, and mother’s highest educational level quite possibly due to missing data for some these confounders; adjusted OR = 0.42 (95% CI, 0.17–1.04); P-value = 0.062 (Online Supplementary Table 1). However, the adjusted OR for linear trend for association between IL6R genotype and severe depression and/or psychosis remained statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounders; adjusted OR = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.45–0.99); P-value = 0.046. Additional sensitivity analyses using severe depression and psychosis as separate outcomes also showed similar results as the main analysis (Online Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).In our dataset, out of 79 cases of severe depression and/or psychosis, 43 participants met criteria for psychosis only (i.e., no co-morbid severe depression) and 30 met criteria for severe depression only (i.e. no co-morbid psychosis), and 6 met criteria for both severe depression and psychosis. We explored the relationship of IL6R genotype with diagnosis of severe depression only and psychotic disorder only. Cross-tabulation of rs2228145 genotype by diagnosis showed that the CC genotype was protective for both diagnoses (Online Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). This is in line with our main analysis presented in Table 1 that examined severe depression and psychosis as separate outcomes but ignored comorbidity. In the group with both severe depression and psychosis (N = 6), the percentage of participants with AA, AC and CC genotype was the same (Online Supplementary Table 6).3.2Association between Asp358Ala and CIS-R depression total scoreData on CIS-R depression total score at age 18 years and IL6R genotype were available for 3400 participants. Mean depression score tended to decrease for each copy of the minor 358Ala [C] allele (Table 2); however, difference in mean depression scores among groups with AA, AC and CC genotype was not statistically significant. Similarly, distributions of depression scores among these groups were not significantly different. Linear regression did not find evidence for an association between Asp358Ala and total depression score at age 18 years (coefficient −0.114; SE = 0.097; P = .243).Table 2CIS-R Depression Total Score at Age 18 Years for the IL6R Genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A > C).IL6R GenotypeSampleDepression Score, Mean (SD)Test Statistic; P-value1Depression Score, Median (IQR)Test Statistic; P-value2A/A11743.33 (4.15)F = 0.748; df = 2; P = 0.4732 (0–5)F = 0.672; df = 2; P = 0.715A/C16193.26 (3.95)2 (0–5)C/C6073.09 (3.82)2 (0–5)1One-way analysis of variance was used to compare mean depression score among three groups.2Independent Sample Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare distributions of depression scores among three groups.3.3Association between Asp358Ala, serum IL-6 and CRP levels and other risk factorsAsp358Ala was strongly associated with serum IL-6 (β = 0.182; SE = 0.019; P = 5.5 × 10−22) and CRP concentrations at age 9 years (β = –0.110; SE = 0.027; P = 3.5 × 10−5). For each copy of the minor 358Ala allele serum IL-6 concentration increased by about 15% (Fig. 2; Table 3). Carriers of the homozygous minor CC genotype had lower CRP compared with carriers of the homozygous AA genotype, although this was not statistically significant. Asp358Ala was not associated with any of the other risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis; all P > 0.20 (Table 4). We carried out additional analysis using linear regression to test the association of Asp358Ala with risk factors that were recorded as continuous variables; no evidence for association was found; all P > 0.10 (Online Supplementary Table 7).Fig. 2Change in Serum IL-6 and CRP Concentrations at Age 9 Years per Copy of the Minor 358Ala Allele.Table 3Concentrations of Serum IL-6 and CRP at Age 9 years by the IL6R genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A > C).Inflammatory MarkerIL6RGenotypeSampleMean (SD)F-statistic; P-value1IL-6 (pg/ml)A/A14371.13 (1.42)F = 11.53; P = 1.1 × 10−5A/C20321.32 (1.69)2C/C7481.46 (1.62)2Total42171.28 (1.60)  CRP (mg/L)A/A14420.83 (2.95)F = 1.83; P = 0.15A/C20370.84 (2.70)C/C7480.62 (2.55)3Total42270.80 (2.76)1One-way Analysis of Variance was used to compare mean concentrations of IL-6 and CRP among groups with the AA, AC and CC genotype.2Calculation of increase in serum IL-6 mean concentration for one copy of C allele: compared with the AA group, mean IL-6 in the AC group was 0.19 pg/ml higher (i.e., 16.8% increase from 1.13 pg/ml for one copy of the C allele). Compared with the AA group, mean IL-6 in the CC group was 0.33 pg/ml higher (i.e., 29.2% increase from 1.13 pg/ml for two copy of the C allele). Therefore, average increase in mean IL-6 concentration for one copy of C allele is (16.8 + 29.2) ÷ 3 = 15.33%.3Calculation of decrease in mean CRP concentration in the group with CC, compared with AA, genotype: 0.83–0.62 = 0.21; (0.21 ÷ 0.83) × 100 = 25.3%.Table 4Association between IL6R Genotype Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A > C), Serum IL-6 and CRP Concentrations, and Other Risk Factors.Risk Factor1Age of AssessmentAvailable SampleStatistic for Association2P-value for AssociationInflammatory MarkersSerum IL-6 LevelMean 9.9y (SD = 0.32)42170.182 (0.019)5.5 × 10−22Serum CRP LevelMean 9.9y (SD = 0.32)4227−0.110 (0.027)3.5 × 10−5  Other Risk FactorsAge at Diagnosis of Depression and PsychosisMean 17.8y (SD = 0.38)35351.5570.211SexAt birth82281.11320.573EthnicityAt birth73721.14620.564Father’s Social ClassAt birth67469.56820.654Mother’s Highest EducationAt birth73986.14420.631Birth WeightAt birth77670.8920.410Gestational AgeAt birth78640.6790.507Mother’s Postnatal Depression8-week post-partum71560.0570.944Childhood Behavioural ProblemsMean 6.8y (SD = 0.11)57180.5550.574Childhood IntelligenceMean 8.7y (SD = 0.32)55090.3530.702Body Mass IndexMean 9.9y (SD = 0.32)58131.520.2181Linear regression was used for IL-6 and CRP (natural logarithm transformed values); One Way Analysis of Variance was used for Age, birth weight, gestational age, Body Mass Index, mother’s Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score at 8 weeks postpartum, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total difficulties score at 7 years, child’s total Wechsler IQ score at 8 years.2Chi-squared test was used for sex, ethnicity, father’s social class, mother’s highest education.4DiscussionUsing data from a population-based birth cohort, we report that a common, functional variant in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala; rs2228145 A > C) that is known to dampen down inflammation is associated with decreased risk of severe depression and/or psychosis. The variant is associated with increased serum IL-6 levels but decreased serum CRP levels, which is consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect of the minor 358Ala allele downstream of IL-6 previously reported by others (Ferreira et al., 2013). Asp358Ala was not associated with any of the risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis, such as age, sex, body mass, social class, ethnicity, maternal post-natal depression, and IQ. Taken together, these findings indicate that the variant affects risk of major psychiatric disorder (severe depression and/or psychosis) by altering levels of inflammation. Previously reported associations between IL-6, depression and psychosis are unlikely to be fully explained by confounders commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis. The variant was not associated with total depression score, which indicates that the IL6R pathway may be relevant for severe rather than mild depression. Based on a small number of cases the findings need replication in other samples, but provide further evidence that the IL-6/IL6R pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and psychosis.We have focused on a specific genetic variant (Asp358Ala; rs2228145) because it is well characterised with regards to its effect on IL6R signaling (Ferreira et al., 2013, Reich et al., 2007). The findings are consistent with biological actions of this genetic variant and with previous epidemiological studies reporting a protective effect of this variant for a number of physical illnesses including CHD (Collaboration et al., 2012), atrial fibrillation (Schnabel et al., 2011), abdominal aortic aneurysm (Harrison et al., 2013), and type-1 diabetes (Ferreira et al., 2013). Asp358Ala is known to dampen down inflammation by reducing membrane bound IL-6 signaling. Although 358Ala increases transcription of the soluble IL6R isoform and not the membrane-bound isoform, 358Ala reduces surface expression of IL-6R on CD4 + T lymphocytes and monocytes (up to 28% reduction per allele). Importantly, reduced expression of membrane-bound IL-6R results in impaired IL-6 responsiveness, as measured by decreased phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT1 following stimulation with IL-6 (Ferreira et al., 2013). A large collaborative meta-analysis of 82 studies has previously reported that Asp358Ala is associated with increased levels of circulating IL-6 and sIL6R, but decreased levels of CRP in adults (Collaboration et al., 2012). We report that the variant is associated with increased IL-6 but decreased CRP levels assessed in childhood, and is protective for severe depression and/or psychosis assessed in early adulthood.The analytic approach is informed by Mendelian randomization, which posits that if a biomarker is causally related to a disease, genetic variant(s) controlling activity of that biomarker should also be associated with the disease (Burgess et al., 2015, Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003). Using genetic variants as proxy for exposure overcomes confounding because genetic variants are inherited at random during meiosis, so are unrelated to potential confounders (measured or unmeasured). Previous research has provided observational evidence for an association between IL-6, depression and psychosis using population-based longitudinal (Gimeno et al., 2009, Khandaker et al., 2014) and cross-sectional studies (Dowlati et al., 2010, Goldsmith et al., 2016, Haapakoski et al., 2015, Howren et al., 2009, Miller et al., 2011, Potvin et al., 2008, Upthegrove et al., 2014). We show that Asp358Ala is strongly associated with serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP, but not with any of the risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis. These findings indicate confounding is not a complete explanation for previously observed associations between IL-6, depression and psychosis.The selection of a specific well-characterized genetic variant is useful because it can serve as a proxy for drug actions. Epidemiological genetic findings can be checked against a drug, so can directly inform development of new treatments. Previous studies of cardiovascular disease have used a similar genetic variant specific approach comparing effects of Asp358Ala with tocilizumab (Collaboration et al., 2012, Swerdlow et al., 2012), and SNPs in IL-1R locus with anakinra (IL-1R antagonist) (Interleukin 1 Genetics Consortium, 2015). Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL6R which inhibits both IL-6 classic and trans signaling (Calabrese and Rose-John, 2014). Improvement in depressive symptoms after treatment with tocilizumab in clinical trials (Gossec et al., 2015, Kappelmann et al., 2016, Traki et al., 2014) is consistent with the observed protective effect of Asp358Ala for severe depression in our epidemiological sample.The variant was not associated with total depression score, which indicates that the IL6R pathway may be relevant for severe rather than mild depression. An alternative explanation might be age of assessment for depression and psychosis. Our sample was relatively young (average age at assessment of outcomes 18 years). A recent GAWS has reported that earlier-onset major depressive disorder is genetically more similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than adult-onset major depression (Power et al., 2017). Although results for severe depression and psychosis were similar, indicating a protective effect of CC genotype, the ORs were not statistically significant. We observed a significant association with Asp358Ala when severe depression and/or psychosis was used as outcome. We combined severe depression and psychosis to increase statistical power, and due to considerable overlap between depression and psychosis in clinical presentation (APA, 2013), environmental and genetic risk factors (Green et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2016).To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine the association of Asp358Ala with depression, circulating inflammatory markers and other psychiatric risk factors using the same sample. Published literature on association between Asp358Ala and schizophrenia is mixed. It has been reported that the CC, compared with AA genotype, may decrease (Kapelski et al., 2015) or increase (Hudson and Miller, 2016) risk of schizophrenia, while one study did not find an association (Sun et al., 2008). A search of existing GWAS results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium revealed that Asp358Ala is associated with risks of schizophrenia (P = 0.019) (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics, 2014), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (P = 0.008) (Neale et al., 2010), but not with major depressive disorder (P = 0.954) (Major Depressive Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric et al., 2013). The relatively young age of the sample and choice of outcome (severe depression and/or psychosis), might explain difference with findings from previous studies.Limitations of the work include a relatively small number of cases of severe depression and psychosis in the ALSPAC cohort. However, the cases were phenotypically well defined and were of similar age, which might have aided detection of an association with the genetic variant. Relatively young age of the sample precludes generalizability of findings to older adults. In future, studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are required. Due to the small number of cases, we have not examined associations between Asp358Ala, depression and psychosis in male and female participants separately. However, the association between Asp358Ala and severe depression and/or psychosis remained significant after controlling for sex. We have not carried out cell-based functional experiments to examine the effects of Asp358Ala on IL6R signaling in our participants. However, association of the genetic variant (minor 358Ala allele) with decreased serum CRP levels are consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect of this genotype downstream of IL-6 as demonstrated by others previously (Ferreira et al., 2013). We have not carried out a two-stage least squared regression analysis to obtain a Mendelian randomization causal estimate for serum IL-6. Although Asp358Ala is associated with serum IL-6 and soluble IL6R levels, it is not clear whether the effect of Asp358Ala on risks of severe depression and/or psychosis is mediated by specifically serum IL-6, soluble IL6R or membrane-bound IL6R.A potential role for IL-6 in pathogenesis of depression, psychosis and other major mental disorders is supported by experimental and clinical studies (Dantzer, 2004, Dantzer et al., 2008, Khandaker and Dantzer, 2016, Miller et al., 2009, Raison et al., 2006). Depression-like behaviour is observed in mice following experimental immune-activation with injection of lipopolysaccharide in peripheral circulation (O'Connor et al., 2009) or direct intracerebroventricular injection of IL-6 (Sukoff Rizzo et al., 2012). IL-6 influences serotonin transporter levels and consequently serotonin reuptake (Kong et al., 2015). Peripheral IL-6 plays a key role in mediating the effect of stress on brain as demonstrated by experiments in mice (Hodes et al., 2014) and in human volunteers (Harrison et al., 2009). In mice, inhibiting IL-6 with a monoclonal antibody prevents depression-like behaviour following exposures to stress (Hodes et al., 2014). Non-specific peripheral immune activation caused by injection of lipopolysaccharide in healthy volunteers increases serum IL-6 levels as well as inducing low mood, anxiety and reduced cognitive performance (Reichenberg et al., 2001). Inflammation-induced mood deterioration and associated changes in the subgenual cingulate activity and mesolimbic connectivity are mediated by circulating IL-6 (Harrison et al., 2009).Low-grade inflammation might be a common mechanism underlying the high comorbidity between depression, schizophrenia, CHD and diabetes. Longitudinal studies have shown that higher serum concentrations of IL-6 increase future risks of heart disease (Danesh et al., 2008), diabetes mellitus (Pradhan et al., 2001), depression and psychosis (Khandaker et al., 2014). Previous studies have reported that Asp358Ala has a protective effect on heart disease (Collaboration et al., 2012, Swerdlow et al., 2012) and type-1 diabetes (Ferreira et al., 2013), which is consistent with our findings, and indicates a potentially causal role for inflammation in these illnesses.Demonstrating a causal role for low-grade inflammation in depression and psychosis may lead to new treatments. Elevated serum inflammatory marker concentrations predict poor response to antidepressants (Yoshimura et al., 2009) and antipsychotics (Mondelli et al., 2015), while treatment resistant patients continue to show elevated cytokine levels (Goldsmith et al., 2016, Maes et al., 1997, O'Brien et al., 2007). Therefore, stratification of patients according to their immune phenotype might aid prediction of treatment response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (Kohler et al., 2014) and cytokine modulators (Kappelmann et al., 2016) may be helpful for some patients with depression and schizophrenia (Muller et al., 2002, Sommer et al., 2014). Recently, a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial (RCT) of infliximab, an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, has reported improvements in patients with treatment resistant depression characterized by high inflammation at baseline (Raison et al., 2013). Based on human population-based data our findings provide further evidence that the IL-6/IL6R pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and psychosis. The field now needs RCTs of cytokine modulators targeting IL-6/IL6R for patients with depression and psychosis, specifically those with evidence of inflammation, to translate these results into benefits for patients.ReferencesAPADiagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders5th ed.2013American Psychiatric PublishingArlington, VABurgessS.TimpsonN.J.EbrahimS.Davey SmithG.Mendelian randomization: where are we now and where are we going?Int.

It is associated with poor response to antidepressant and antipsychotics, and could potentially be a treatment target. However, there is limited data on the prevalence of low-grade inflammation in major psychiatric disorders, and on the characteristics of patients who show evidence of inflammation. We examined the prevalence of low-grade inflammation and associated socio-demographic and clinical factors in acute psychiatric inpatients.An anonymised search of the electronic patient records of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust was used to identify patients aged 18–65 years who were hospitalised between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive). We excluded patients on antibiotics or oral steroids, or with missing data. Inflammation was defined using serum C-reactive protein (>3 mg/L) or total white cell count (>9.4 × 109/L) as measured within 14 days of admission.Out of all 599 admissions, the prevalence of inflammation (serum CRP >3 mg/L) in the ICD-10 diagnostic groups of psychotic disorders (F20–29), mood disorders (F30–39), neurotic disorders (F40–48) and personality disorders (F60–69) was 32%, 21%, 22% and 42%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, low-grade inflammation was associated with older age, black ethnicity, being single, self-harm, diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, current treatments with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and with current treatment for medical comorbidities.A notable proportion of acutely unwell psychiatric patients from all ICD-10 major diagnostic groups show evidence of low-grade inflammation, suggesting inflammation may be relevant for all psychiatric disorders.KeywordsPsychosisDepressionCRPInflammationWhite cell countImmunopsychiatry1IntroductionMajor psychiatric disorders such as depression, psychosis and anxiety are associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, as reflected by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. interleukin-6, and acute phase proteins, e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), in peripheral blood during acute illness (Dickerson et al., 2016; Goldsmith et al., 2016; Howren et al., 2009; Maes, 1999; Upthegrove et al., 2014; Vogelzangs et al., 2013). Population-based longitudinal studies have shown that elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers during pregnancy or in childhood are associated with higher risk of developing symptoms of depression, psychosis and mania subsequently in adulthood (Canetta et al., 2014; Dalman et al., 2008; Hayes et al., 2017; Khandaker et al., 2014; Khandaker et al., 2012; Khandaker et al., 2013; Liang and Chikritzhs, 2012; Metcalf et al., 2017), suggesting that low-grade systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of major psychiatric disorders. Further evidence for a role of inflammation in psychiatric disorders comes from treatment studies. Meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate that anti-inflammatory drugs may have antidepressant effects. Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors given as adjuncts to antidepressants improve depressive symptoms in patients with depression (Köhler et al., 2014). Anti-cytokine drugs, which target inflammation more specifically, reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic inflammatory illness independently of improvements in physical illness (Kappelmann et al., 2016). However, evidence for the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment for psychotic disorders is less clear-cut. While some studies did not find an effect (Girgis et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2016; Nitta et al., 2013), adjunctive treatment with aspirin may be beneficial for psychosis (Sommer et al., 2013). Minocycline, a tetracyclic antibiotic, may improve negative symptoms and cognition in the early stages of schizophrenia (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Solmi et al., 2017).It is likely that low-grade inflammation or anti-inflammatory drugs will be relevant for a subset of patients, because not all individuals with a major psychiatric disorder show evidence of inflammation. However, the prevalence of low-grade inflammation in patients with psychiatric disorders and clinical characteristics of patients who show evidence of inflammation is poorly understood. Previous studies have often compared concentrations of inflammatory markers between cases and non-cases, but there is limited data from clinical samples as to what proportion of patients with different psychiatric disorders show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation. The proportion of depressed patients with elevated CRP ranges from 19 to 47% according to previous studies, but studies based on acutely unwell inpatients are scarce (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Rethorst et al., 2014; Uher et al., 2014; Wysokiński et al., 2015). A large, population-based study from Denmark reported that about one third of patients with a history of hospitalisation for depression show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation, defined as a serum CRP level >3 mg/L (Wium-Andersen et al., 2013). However, data on the prevalence of inflammation in other patient groups is limited.A better understanding of psychiatric patients who present with evidence of inflammation is necessary because inflammation is thought to contribute to treatment resistance. Higher pre-treatment levels of IL-6 predict a poorer response to antidepressants (Lanquillon et al., 2000; Maes et al., 1997) and antipsychotics (Lin et al., 1998; Mondelli et al., 2015) in patients with depression and schizophrenia, respectively. Higher baseline CRP levels are associated with improvements in depressive symptoms in treatment resistant depression treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody (Raison et al., 2013).The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of low-grade systemic inflammation in acutely unwell psychiatric inpatients from all major ICD-10 diagnostic groups, and to elucidate the demographic and clinical factors associated with inflammation in this population. We compared psychiatric patients with and without low-grade systemic inflammation on a number of characteristics, including socio-demographic factors, primary diagnosis, prescribed medication, medical comorbidity, self-harm, alcohol misuse and length of admission. We repeated the analyses by defining inflammation using total white cell count (WBC) to check the robustness of associations observed using CRP.2Material and methods2.1SettingWe carried out an anonymised search of the electronic patient records of the UK National Health Service (NHS) Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) to identify patients hospitalised between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive). All patients had been hospitalised to this mental health hospital for the treatment of a psychiatric disorder. Patient records were de-identified using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) for secondary research (Fernandes et al., 2013), and transferred into a research database with NHS and institutional approvals (UK NHS National Research Ethics Service reference 12/EE/0407). All patients who are admitted to CPFT acute hospitals are offered blood testing for CRP and WBC as per hospital protocol.2.2Sample selection and electronic search procedureWe searched the CRIS database for records meeting the following inclusion criteria: a) patients admitted to inpatient beds between 2013 and 2016, inclusive; b) aged 18–65; c) had a recorded ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis (F01–F99); d) a blood test result for CRP or for WBC had been recorded on the electronic medical notes system within 14 days of admission. Exclusion criteria were: a) patients taking antibiotics (proxy for a current acute infection), b) patients on oral steroids. Patients on NSAIDs were not excluded as the presence of a chronic inflammatory condition is a key confounder and we wanted to be able to correct for it.2.3Extraction and coding of categorical informationFor each patient, we extracted the following categorical information directly from the database: date of birth/age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, admission date, current ICD-10 diagnoses, and length of index admission. When a patient was admitted more than once in a six-month period, the first admission was used to avoid over-representation of patients with recurrent admissions (see also Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Data extracted from CRIS included diagnostic codes which could have been assigned to that patient at any time in the past according to the 10th Revision of the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Treating clinicians assigned the diagnoses, which were recorded by clinicians or administrative staff.2.4Extraction and coding of CRP and WBC data, and definition of low-grade inflammationA custom-built natural language processing software was used to extract numerical data relating to blood inflammatory markers. We extracted all available data relating to CRP and WBC. Only entries where CRP or WBC were recorded were kept for further analysis. The method for data extraction was accurate and reliable as measured by recall (probability of retrieving a record given it was relevant) and precision (probability of a record being relevant, given it was retrieved) statistics (see Supplementary Methods for procedure of calculating these statistics). Blood samples from patients admitted in Cambridge or Peterborough were tested in different labs, using assays with different sensitivity. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Heart Association guidelines CRP levels over 3 mg/L is considered to be high (Pearson et al., 2003; Ridker, 2003); such levels are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease (Koenig et al., 1999) and psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia (Metcalf et al., 2017) in population-based studies. For the purpose of this study, we have defined low-grade inflammation as a serum CRP level >3 mg/L. This is because the hospital laboratory only reported an exact value for CRP if it was equal or over 4 mg/L; levels below this threshold were reported as ≤3 mg/L (see Supplementary Methods for further details). Inflammation was coded as a binary variable: not inflamed (CRP ≤3 mg/L) or inflamed ( 3 mg/L). For analyses using total WBC, we selected a cut-off value of 9.4 × 109/L to define inflammation. This cut-off represents the third quartile of the distribution of WBC in our sample. This threshold is lower than the most common UK upper reference value for total WBC (11 × 109/L). Therefore, our approach captured subjects with low-grade inflammation rather than those with very high inflammation.2.5Data on prescribed medications including medical comorbidityA list of medications prescribed within +/−3 months of current admission was extracted using the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) software (Cunningham et al., 2013). Medications were manually classified in drug classes (antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and sleep inducers, mood stabilisers, medication for medical comorbidities, NSAIDs and pain control medication, antibiotics – exclusion criterium, oral steroids – exclusion criterium). Antipsychotic medications were further divided into sub-classes (typical and atypical). Current prescriptions for an anti-hypertensive, diuretic, anti-diabetic, statin, anti-aggregant, anti-coagulant or medication for the management of dyslipidaemias were used as proxy for the presence of common, chronic medical illness. See the Supplementary Methods for further details about medication data coding.2.6Main psychiatric diagnosisMany patients had more than one recorded diagnosis. We used a hierarchical method to assign one “main diagnosis” per patient as follows: organic mental disorder > psychotic disorder > mood disorder > anxiety disorder > personality disorder > other psychiatric diagnosis. Presence of a diagnosis in an earlier category trumped diagnosis in subsequent categories, i.e., if a patient had recorded diagnoses of both a psychotic disorder and an anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder was chosen as main diagnosis.2.7Statistical analysisWe calculated the prevalence of inflammation, defined as CRP >3 mg/L, for each major ICD-10 diagnostic group. We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) for the following factors: age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, main diagnosis, self-harm, alcohol abuse, medical comorbidities, current medications, length of admission. All predictors were coded as categorical variables. Age was converted to a categorical variable using the 25th, 50th and 75th centiles as cut-offs, which correspond to age 28, 39 and 49 years respectively. Length of admission was converted to binary as above or below median (13 days). The ORs were calculated using the following groups as reference: female sex, white British ethnicity, single status, age <28, “other” diagnosis, “short” admission (<13 days). The same procedure was followed for analyses where inflammation was defined as total WBC >9.4 × 109/L.In addition, an independent sample t test was used to compare mean values for continuous variables between groups with and without inflammation (e.g. age, length of admission); a Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables (e.g. sex, marital status and ethnicity). We tested the association between CRP (binary variable) and total WBC (continuous variable) using logistic regression; high CRP (>3 mg/L) was the dependent variable, and WBC was the independent variable. All statistical analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2017). Plots were made using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009), using the Cairo R graphics device (Urbanek and Horner, 2005).3Results3.1SamplesThe electronic search yielded data on 6731 admissions for patients of any age to CPFT inpatient facilities between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, our analytic sample comprised 599 admissions with data on CRP (546 unique patients). Admissions with data on WBC were 1072 (978 unique patients). There were no differences in sex, ethnicity, or age distribution between patients who had available blood results (analytic sample), and those who didn’t, however the analytic sample was relatively impoverished in married patients (see Supplementary Table 1). For CRP data, recall was 1.0 and precision was 0.96 indicating that the method for data extraction was accurate and reliable. For WBC data, recall was 0.76 and precision was 1.0. See Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for sample selection methods for analysis of CRP and WBC respectively.3.2Prevalence of low-grade inflammation (Serum CRP level >3 mg/L)This analysis included 599 admissions; 48% men, mean age 39 years (SD 13). The prevalence of low-grade inflammation, as defined by serum CRP >3 mg/L, in this sample of acutely unwell, psychiatric inpatients was 28% (see Table 1). The prevalence of inflammation in the major ICD-10 diagnostic groups of psychotic disorders (F20–29), mood disorders (F30–39), neurotic disorders (F40–48) and personality disorders (F60–69) was 32%, 21%, 22% and 42%, respectively (see Fig. 1 and Table 3). In multivariable analyses, a diagnosis of unipolar depression was associated with a decreased risk of inflammation after adjusting for sex, age, marital status, ethnicity, main diagnosis, comorbidities, current medication, and length of admission (adjusted OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11–0.57; p = 0.001). The other diagnoses did not show any significant association with inflammation (see Fig. 2 and Table 2).Fig. 1Prevalence of Inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L or WBC >9.4 × 109/L) by Diagnosis.Legend: CRP: proportion of inflamed patients as measured by CRP >3mg/L; WBC: proportion of inflamed patients as measured by WBC >9.4 × 109/L.Fig. 1Fig. 2Adjusted Odds Ratios for Inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L or WBC >9.4 × 109/L) for Demographic and Clinical Factors.Legend: BAD: bipolar affective disorder; PD: personality disorder; SH: self-harm.NOTE: Reference categories are: female for sex, white for ethnicity, single for marital status, 18–27 for age, other for diagnosis, the absence of the condition for each comorbidity, and ≤13 days for length of stay.

Sex was not associated with inflammation (see Fig. 2 and Table 1, Table 2).3.2.2Association with prescribed medicationLow-grade inflammation was associated with current treatments with antidepressants (adjusted OR = 1.85; 95% CI:1.03–3.33; p = 0.038), benzodiazepines and/or hypnotics (adjusted OR = 1.81; 95% CI:1.01–3.22; p = 0.045). Mood stabilisers were associated with a decreased risk of inflammation (adjusted OR = 0.35; 95% CI:0.17–0.73; p = 0.005). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers were not associated with inflammation (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). There was no association between the number of prescribed psychotropic medications and the risk of inflammation. Inflammation was not associated with antipsychotic medications after controlling for potential confounders.3.2.3Association with medical comorbidityPatients with medical comorbidities were more likely to be inflamed (adjusted OR = 2.48; 95% CI:1.20–5.13; p = 0.01), after correcting for sex, age, marital status, ethnicity, main diagnosis, other comorbidities, current medication, and length of admission (see Table 2 and Fig. 2).3.2.4Association with self-harm, drug and alcohol usePatients with a current or historical diagnosis of self-harm or poisoning were more likely to be inflamed compared with those without such history (adjusted OR = 1.91; 95% CI:1.12–3.25; p = 0.02). History of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependency were not associated with inflammation (See Table 2 and Fig. 2).3.2.5Association with length of admissionLow-grade inflammation was not associated with total length of admission in analyses using length of admission as a binary variable (See Fig. 2).3.2.6Sensitivity analyses excluding admissions with CRP >20 mg/LIn sensitivity analyses we excluded admissions of patients who presented CRP levels >20 mg/L. The results remained mostly unchanged (see Supplementary Fig. 3), except that the associations between inflammation and marital status and black ethnicity were no longer statistically significant.3.3Results for additional analyses using high white cell count (>9.4 × 109/L) to define inflammation3.3.1Relationship between CRP and WBCData on both CRP and WBC were available for 325 participants. Logistic regression using CRP as a binary dependent variable (CRP >3 mg/L vs ≤3 mg/L) and WBC as a continuous predictor variable showed that CRP was associated with WBC (beta = 0.13, SE = 0.04, z = 3.068, p = 0.002). The OR for high CRP (>3 mg/L) for those with high WBC (>9.4 × 109/L) was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.32–3.90, p = 0.003).3.3.2Prevalence of inflammation using WBC (>9.4 × 109/L)This analysis included 1072 admissions; 56% men, mean age 39 years (SD 13). The prevalence of low-grade inflammation, defined as WBC >9.4 × 109/L, in this sample was 25% (see Supplementary Table 2). Table 4 provides a summary of the significant findings, comparing them to those obtained using CRP.Table 4Summary of significant findings.Table 4OR for inflammation defined as CRP >3 mg/LOR for inflammation defined as WBC >9.4*109/LConcordance between CRP and WBC analysesBlack ethnicity↑⇣NMarried status↓↓↓Older age↑↑↑Diagnosis of schizophrenia⇡↑⇡Diagnosis of bipolar disorder⇡↑⇡Diagnosis of unipolar depression↓⇡NCurrent or past self-harm↑↔NCurrent treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotics⇣↓⇣Current treatment with antidepressants↑↑↑Current treatment with benzodiazepines↑↑↑Current treatment with mood stabilisers↓⇡NCurrent treatment for medical comorbidity↑↔NLegend: ↑ = OR >1 and statistically significant suggesting these factors increase inflammation; ↓ = OR <1 and statistically significant suggesting these factors decrease inflammation; ⇡ = OR >1 but not statistically significant suggesting these factors may decrease inflammation; ⇣ = OR <1 but not statistically significant suggesting these factors may decrease inflammation; ↔ = OR not statistically different from 1; N = results are not concordant between CRP and WBC.3.3.3Association of high WBC (>9.4 × 109/L) with demographic factorsHigh WBC (>9.4 × 109/L) was associated with married status (adjusted OR = 0.62; 95% CI:0.4–0.97; p = 0.04), older age (adjusted OR for age 40–49, compared with age <28 = 1.75; 95% CI:1.1–2.7; p = 0.01), but not with ethnicity (see Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and Fig. 2).3.3.4Association of high WBC (>9.4 × 109/L) with clinical factorsHigh WBC (>9.4 × 109/L) was associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (adjusted OR = 2.41; 95% CI:1.3–4.5; p < 0.01), other psychotic disorders (adjusted OR = 1.99; CI:1.04–3.8; p = 0.04), and bipolar affective disorder (adjusted OR = 2.26; 95% CI:1.2–4.4; p = 0.01), after adjusting the model for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, main diagnosis, self-harm, alcohol abuse, medical comorbidities, current medications, length of admission. Current treatments with typical antipsychotics (adjusted OR = 0.39; 95% CI:0.2–0.7; p = 0.002), and typical plus atypical antipsychotics (adjusted OR = 0.35; 95% CI:0.2–0.7; p = 0.006) were associated with lower WBC. On the other hand, current treatment with antidepressants (adjusted OR = 1.60; 95% CI:1.04–2.4; p = 0.03) and benzodiazepines (adjusted OR = 1.68; 95% CI:1.04–2.7; p = 0.04) were associated with high WBC (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3).4DiscussionWe studied low-grade inflammation in acute psychiatric inpatients on admission across different diagnostic groups. Overall, over a quarter of all patients in our sample showed evidence of inflammation. Evidence of low-grade inflammation was present in all major diagnostic groups, with prevalences ranging from 12 to 40% depending on the measure. A number of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with inflammation. Older age and current treatment with antidepressants and benzodiazepines were associated with an increased risk of inflammation after controlling for potential confounders. These findings were consistent across analyses using CRP and WBC as markers of inflammation. Being married appeared to be protective against inflammation, but evidence for this association did not persist after excluding patients with CRP >20 mg/L. There was some evidence that inflammation was associated with current/past self-harm and with being on treatment for medical comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Diagnoses of schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder were associated with an increased risk of inflammation, while treatments with mood stabilisers or antipsychotics were associated decreased risk of inflammation.There could be many reasons for a high prevalence of low-grade inflammation in acutely unwell psychiatric patients. Psychological stress can activate the immune system (Padgett and Glaser, 2003). Exposure to early-life adversity, common in psychiatric patients, can increase levels of inflammation in adulthood (Baumeister et al., 2016). Inflammation could be a marker of co-morbid inflammatory physical illness. However, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation could be an intrinsic part of psychiatric illnesses. Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies show increased levels of inflammatory markers in acutely unwell patients with depression and psychosis (Howren et al., 2009; Potvin et al., 2008). Population-based longitudinal studies have reported that higher levels of IL-6 and CRP are associated with symptoms/diagnosis of depression, mania and psychosis subsequently in life (Gimeno et al., 2009; Hayes et al., 2017; Khandaker et al., 2014; Khandaker et al., 2017; Metcalf et al., 2017; Zalli et al., 2016), suggesting low-grade inflammation could be a cause for these illnesses, rather than simply being a consequence.Our results are in line with previous studies reporting prevalence of low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) in depression (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Wium-Andersen et al., 2013). These studies have investigated inflammation in depression in specific contexts such as in premenopausal women, in depressed outpatients, or in the general population. Our study adds to previous findings by reporting the prevalence of inflammation a) in a psychiatric inpatient population, and b) in other patient groups.A previous study examined the prevalence of inflammation in the general population, and found that, using reference limits set at the time of the analysis, for WBC 21.4% of the population had an above-reference value, and for CRP 22.2% of the population had above-reference results (Andersen et al., 2014). However, it should be noted that cut-offs for WBC/CRP levels used to define low-grade inflammation in our study were different, as we were interested in low-grade inflammation.Associations of inflammation with older age, marital status and ethnic minority status are consistent with previous studies (Khera et al., 2005; Sbarra, 2009; Wener et al., 2000; Woloshin and Schwartz, 2005), although we have not seen any association with sex. In our sample, current treatments with antidepressants, anxiolytics/hypnotics were robustly associated with inflammation. This is consistent with previous studies reporting elevated levels of inflammatory markers in patients with depression (Dowlati et al., 2010; Goldsmith et al., 2016; Haapakoski et al., 2015; Howren et al., 2009). Furthermore, raised levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression and psychosis in young adulthood (Khandaker et al., 2014), and persistent depressive symptoms during the second decade of life (Khandaker et al., 2017). However, a diagnosis of depression was associated with lower risk of inflammation, which is surprising. It is possible that antidepressant prescription is a better proxy for current depression in our sample; data on diagnoses obtained from electronic health records were historical, while prescription data refers to the current admission. Nevertheless, there was some evidence that high WBC was associated with a diagnosis of depression although this was not statistically significant. We did not have repeat measures of CRP/WBC at the end of the admission, so it was not possible to examine the association of inflammation with treatment response.Association of inflammation with self-harm and medical comorbidities are consistent with previous studies. Previous studies have reported an association between inflammation and suicidal ideation/behaviour (Gibbs et al., 2016; Park and Kim, 2017). Self-harm and suicidal ideas are markers of psychiatric multi-morbidity (Hui et al., 2013), so reflect patients with greater psychological distress. Previous studies have reported that inflammatory markers are associated with the severity of depressive symptoms (Köhler-Forsberg et al., 2017) and with persistent depressive symptoms (Khandaker et al., 2017; Zalli et al., 2016). Both cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are associated with low-grade inflammation (Koenig et al., 1999; Pearson et al., 2003). There is evidence of insufficient glucocorticoid signalling and elevated inflammation in coronary heart disease patients with comorbid depression (Nikkheslat et al., 2015). However, data on medical comorbidities were often missing in the electronic health record, so prescribed medications were used as a proxy.A decreased risk of inflammation in patients taking mood stabilisers is consistent with known anti-inflammatory effects of lithium (Kucharz et al., 1993; Sluzewska et al., 1997) and valproate (Yuen et al., 2010). CRP levels increase during a manic phase, which is at least partially reversed by treatment with mood stabilisers (Fernandes et al., 2016). Our finding is also consistent with a previous longitudinal study reporting an association between childhood IL-6 levels and lifetime hypomanic symptoms assessed in adulthood (Hayes et al., 2017). Interestingly, inflammation was not associated with the prescription of NSAIDs, which was used as a proxy for chronic inflammatory illness. This suggests that the inflammation seen in psychiatric patients in our sample might not be driven solely by co-morbid inflammatory medical conditions, but it could rather be inherent to their psychiatric illness.The diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder were also associated with an increased risk of inflammation measured through WBC, while antipsychotic treatment was associated with a protective effect. The results are consistent with recent evidence showing there is an increase in peripheral inflammatory markers in schizophrenia, which normalised with antipsychotic treatment. IL-1β, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are schizophrenia state markers, as they increase in acute relapses and first episode psychosis and normalize with antipsychotic treatment (Miller et al., 2011). In contrast, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and soluble IL-2 receptor are trait markers, as levels remain elevated in acute exacerbations and following antipsychotic treatment. Furthermore, IL-6 levels correlate positively with symptom severity (Miller et al., 2011). There is evidence that elevated CRP in adolescence is associated with increased risk of psychosis later on in life (Metcalf et al., 2017).The limitations of this study need to be considered carefully. This study is based on retrospective analysis of data from an electronic health record that was not created for the purpose of research. Although the work demonstrates that routine clinical databases can be used to address important research questions, there are limitations to using routine clinical data. Missing data is a key issue. Although all patients admitted to CPFT inpatient hospitals are offered a physical examination including a blood test (which includes WBC and CRP routinely), only a subset of all potentially eligible patients had data on inflammatory markers. Approximately 41% of the admissions that we considered (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) had recorded blood results within 14 days of admission. The remaining 59% who did not have blood results recorded within 2 weeks of admission were not included in our study; these patients might have refused venepuncture at the time of admission or had bloods taken after 14 days of coming into hospital, which we excluded from our study to minimize potential effects of hospital treatment. CRP and WBC data recall and precision also affected the probability of inclusion into the analytic sample, as described in the methods. While the possibility of selection bias due to missing data cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely that blood tests were offered primarily because of a suspected physical illness. Therefore, the increased prevalence of inflammation in psychiatric patients is unlikely to be due to a physical illness. Data on diagnosis were also missing for many patients. We included only patients with a clinician-coded ICD-10 diagnosis to increase accuracy. Therefore, diagnosis data are more specific than sensitive. However, patients often more than one psychiatric diagnosis, so we used a hierarchical approach to assign a single main diagnosis to each patient. This hierarchical approach has been used previously in psychiatric research (Foulds and Bedford, 1975). It is possible that for some patients the reason for admission was different from their main diagnosis, leading to misclassification of diagnosis. However, this is unlikely to be an issue for a majority of patients.To explore potential selection bias due to missing data, we compared demographic factors between the analytic sample and missing sample (all unique patients meeting all selection criteria but with no recorded CRP on admission). These samples were similar in terms of sociodemographic factors except for marital status, suggesting that, while the possibility of selection bias cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely to be a major issue (see Supplementary Table 1). However, the prevalence of inflammation in patients with depression observed in our sample is comparable to previous studies of depression (Cizza et al., 2009; Raison et al., 2013; Wium-Andersen et al., 2013): this is reassuring. The database would not differentiate between first and subsequent admissions for a specific patient for a given diagnosis, therefore we were unable to compare recent onset cases with those with chronic illness.A recent clinical study found associations between WBC and greater bipolar severity (Köhler et al., 2017). We did not have data on severity of illness. However, the fact that patients were admitted to hospital is an indication that they were severely unwell.Our study is limited to patients who were admitted to hospital. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine the prevalence of inflammation in psychiatric inpatients from all major ICD-10 diagnostic groups. However, the decision to admit is often guided by clinical risk perceived by clinicians, so the findings may not be generalizable to all patients. We did not have readily available data on BMI, smoking or recreational drug use. Therefore, the association between inflammation and diagnosis of psychosis might reflect antipsychotic induced obesity/metabolic disturbance. Due to the lack of an electronic prescribing system, we used a natural language processing software to extract names of prescribed drugs from medical notes. This system has been previously validated in a similar study (Cardinal et al., 2015). However, while we were able to ascertain whether a particular drug was prescribed or not, we could not ascertain specific indication for that prescription. The same psychotropic drugs can be prescribed for many disorders. Therefore, the relationship between prescribed antidepressant and inflammation might reflect that inflammation is associated with a range of disorders for which these drugs are prescribed, rather than depression specifically.5ConclusionsIn summary, our findings indicate that a large minority of acutely unwell psychiatric patients show evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation, regardless of their diagnosis. Low-grade inflammation is associated with a number of socio-demographic and clinical factors, which may help to characterise an inflammatory sub-type of the major psychiatric disorders. For conditions such as depression, it is known that an inflammatory phenotype is associated with treatment resistance. This is not known for all other psychiatric disorders. Characterising the inflammatory sub-type of psychiatric disorders could therefore allow to predict which patients might be treatment resistant, and incentivises work into elucidating the clinical phenotype of inflamed patients presenting with other psychiatric conditions.However, before our work can be generalised further work based on other settings (e.g., outpatients) and samples (e.g., general population) is required.Conflicts of interestThe authors have no conflict of interests to declare.ReferencesAndersenC.L.SiersmaV.D.KarlslundW.HasselbalchH.C.FeldingP.BjerrumO.W.de Fine OlivariusN.The Copenhagen primary care differential count (CopDiff) databaseClin.

IFN treatment is associated with depressive symptoms, whereas anti‐TNFα therapies elicit positive mood. This study describes the actions of 2 monoaminergic antidepressants (escitalopram, nortriptyline) and 3 anti‐inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, prednisolone, and anti‐TNFα antibody) on the response of human monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDMs) from 6 individuals to LPS or IFN‐α. Expression profiling revealed robust changes in the MDM transcriptome (3294 genes at P < 0.001) following LPS challenge, whereas a more limited subset of genes (499) responded to IFNα. Contrary to published reports, administered at nontoxic doses, neither monoaminergic antidepressant significantly modulated the transcriptional response to either inflammatory challenge. Each anti‐inflammatory drug had a distinct impact on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and on the profile of inducible gene expression—notably on the regulation of enzymes involved in metabolism of tryptophan. Inter alia, the effect of anti‐TNFα antibody confirmed a predicted autocrine stimulatory loop in human macrophages. The transcriptional changes were predictive of tryptophan availability and kynurenine synthesis, as analyzed by targeted metabolomic studies on cellular supernatants. We suggest that inflammatory processes in the brain or periphery could impact on depression by altering the availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis and/or by increasing production of neurotoxic kynurenine.anti‐inflammatorydepressioninflammatory signalingkynureninemacrophagemonoaminergictranscriptomicstryptophanMedical Research CouncilGlaxoSmithKlinesource-schema-version-number2.0component-idjlb10037cover-dateApril 2018details-of-publishers-convertorConverter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:version=5.3.7.2 mode:remove_FC converted:30.04.2018ReganT, GillAC, ClohiseySM, et al.

One plausible sequence of events is that peripheral proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6, induced the expression of enzymes involved in tryptophan catabolism, for example, indoleamine dioxygenase, kynurenine hydroxylase, and kynureninase,10 thereby reducing the availability of synaptic serotonin11, 12, 13; which is a proximal cause of depressive symptoms.14 Inflammation‐induced changes in tryptophan metabolism can also lead to increased synthesis of kynurenine and its metabolites, many of which are known to be glutamatergic agonists and/or neurotoxic.15 Thus, inflammation could produce the “double hit” both reducing the availability of serotonin and increasing production of kynurenine.The same mechanisms may explain the clinical observation that patients with depressive symptoms in the context of peripheral inflammation (“inflamed depression”) are less responsive to monoaminergic antidepressant drugs, so called “treatment‐resistant depression.”16 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for example, are thought to increase the synaptic availability of serotonin (by blocking active uptake by presynaptic neurons expressing the serotonin transporter protein (SERT/SLC6A4)).17 If synaptic serotonin is reduced by an inflammatory response, and SSRIs are not anti‐inflammatory,18 SSRIs are likely to be less effective in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus. Additionally, the neurotoxic effects of kynurenine and its metabolites, which are exacerbated by inflammation, are mediated by glutamatergic‐related mechanisms that are not modulated by monoaminergic antidepressants. Treatment‐resistant depression—due to reduced serotonin availability and increased neurotoxicity by non‐serotonergic mechanisms—is thus predictable in the context of peripheral inflammation.12, 13, 19, 20
Here we report on a series of experiments designed to test the mechanistic connections between inflammatory and monoaminergic systems in a human primary cell model, monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDMs). Macrophages are both initiators and mediators of inflammation‐associated pathology21 and have long been implicated in inflammation induced depression,20 largely based on the inflammatory induced activation of tryptophan depletion pathways.10, 19, 20 Microglia, the macrophages of the brain,22 play a crucial role in neuronal homeostasis, and the impairments in neuronal function associated with many clinical disorders, including major depression.23 Unlike human macrophages, mouse macrophages do not induce tryptophan uptake or enzymes associated with tryptophan metabolism in response to proinflammatory signals,24 making them a poor model for such studies. In the current study, we have used human MDMs, differentiated by CSF1, to study the impacts of 2 antidepressant drugs and 3 anti‐inflammatory drugs on the transcriptional response to 2 proinflammatory challenges: LPS and IFNα. In addition to acting as a primary human cell model for microglia, these cells are also used to examine tryptophan depletion mechanisms during peripheral inflammation, and how drugs may influence this effect.LPS is a well‐studied Gram‐negative bacterial cell wall endotoxin that acts through activation of the TLR4 receptor, an archetypal pattern recognition receptor that signals through two well‐defined complementary signaling pathways to induce proinflammatory cytokines and IFN target genes.25, 26 As part of the FANTOM5 consortium, we have recently generated extensive promotor‐level data on the time‐course of the response of MDM.27 IFNα is a type‐1 IFN and was chosen as a stimulus because of the clinical data indicating that this agent can cause a depressive syndrome in patients.6, 7 We have previously compared and contrasted the transcriptional response of mouse macrophages to type‐1 IFN and LPS treatment.28
Three classes of anti‐inflammatory drugs were selected to examine their effects on both inflammatory stimuli: a neutralizing antibody for the inflammatory cytokine TNFα; a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (indomethacin); and a steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (prednisolone). Neutralizing anti‐TNFα antibodies act by binding to TNFα in circulation, thus blocking its proinflammatory effects mediated by action at TNF receptors.29 TNFα acts in an autocrine manner on stimulated macrophages to induce downstream targets and amplify the initial induction of proinflammatory target genes.27, 30 Indomethacin acts by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) or prostaglandin synthase enzymes (COX1/COX2; PTGS1/PTGS2).31 The anti‐inflammatory activity of COX inhibitors is thought to depend on preventing inducible prostaglandin production, which can also act in an autocrine manner in macrophages through inducible prostaglandin receptors.25 Both COX‐inhibiting and TNFα‐inhibiting drugs have been shown to have some antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in patients with psychologic symptoms in the context of medical inflammatory disorders.32 Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone, are amongst the most commonly prescribed anti‐inflammatory agents, and act by inducing multiple feedback repressors of inflammation, including IκB and DUSP1.33 The responses to glucocorticoids also differ radically between humans and mice, due to the gain and loss of glucocorticoid response elements in enhancers,33 so there is a clear need to study their effects in humans systems. The glucocorticoid ligand/receptor complex may also directly repress signaling by interfering with the activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NF‐κB34 leading to a genome wide blockade of NF‐κB interactions with chromatin.35
We also studied the action of two monoaminergic antidepressant drugs on MDMs, a SSRI (escitalopram) and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA; nortriptyline). SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed drugs for treating depression and their efficacy depends at least partly on increasing synaptic availability of serotonin (5‐HT). However, 5‐HT also plays an important role in immune signaling,36 and SSRIs have been shown to enhance the cytolytic function of NK cells, to enhance B cell numbers, and to inhibit 5‐HT uptake and immune signaling by dendritic cells,37 suggesting that immune mechanisms might also contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. The TCAs are less selectively serotonergic, and also block multiple classes of receptors for acetylcholine, histamine and noradrenaline. The use of TCAs in the treatment of the residual symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease,38 suggests they may have some efficacy as anti‐inflammatory agents.39 Supplemental Fig. S1 illustrates the known mode of action of each drug examined here.We analyzed the gene expression profiles of MDM in response to inflammatory challenge in the presence and absence of anti‐inflammatory or monoaminergic antidepressant drug treatment. Network‐based methods were deployed to represent the expression changes induced by inflammatory challenges, and the modulation of response by each of the 5 drugs tested. We tested the specific prior hypotheses (i) that proinflammatory challenges will cause changes in expression of genes related to tryptophan metabolism; (ii) that monoaminergic antidepressants (nortriptyline, escitalopram) will attenuate inflammation‐induced changes in tryptophan‐related genes; or (iii) that anti‐inflammatory drugs (prednisolone, indomethacin, anti‐TNFα antibody) will attenuate the regulation of tryptophan‐related genes; (iv) that inflammatory activation of human macrophages results in decreased production of tryptophan and increased production of kynurenine; and (v) that anti‐inflammatory drugs can attenuate changes in tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine production.2MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1Study design overviewMDM cultures from each of 6 different individuals were treated with 1 of the 3 anti‐inflammatory drugs, 2 antidepressant drugs, or a vehicle control. They were then stimulated with either IFNα or LPS for either 7 or 24 h prior to sample collection, or incubated for 24 h with no inflammatory stimulus. Cell culture supernatants were then analyzed by ELISA for cytokine production, and RNA samples extracted from cells and subjected to microarray analysis (Fig. 1). Analysis of these data revealed changes induced by inflammatory challenge in tryptophan/kynurenine gene expression that were moderated by anti‐inflammatory drugs and predictive of altered tryptophan/kynurenine metabolism. We tested this prediction in a secondary metabolomics study of the effects of inflammatory challenge and drug treatment on the levels of tryptophan and kynurenine, measured in the cell supernatant using HPLC/MS. A linear mixed effects model was employed with each donor/subject as a random effect to account for interdonor variations, which could potentially lead to false results with a sample size of only n = 6 (see below).Figure 1Study design and differential gene expression in response to inflammatory challenge. (A) Schematic representation of experimental design. Fully differentiated human MDMs (day 8) were generated from 6 individuals aged 20–30 years, 3 male and 3 female. Cells were then pretreated with either escitalopram, nortriptyline, an anti‐TNFα antibody, indomethacin, prednisolone, or controls (a nonspecific IgG antibody with DMSO vector), or untreated. Cells were then exposed to LPS or IFNα challenge and harvested at either 7 or 24 h, or cultured for 24 h with no inflammatory stimulus.

They were then cultured at 5 × 105 cells/well in 1 mL on a 12‐well plate in RPMI supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, glutamax (Invitrogen, Loughborough, UK), and 10% fetal calf serum for 7 d in the presence of rhCSF‐1 (a gift from Chiron, Emeryville, CA) at 104 U/mL to produce MDM. All donors were medically healthy and between 20 and 50 years old (3 male, 3 female).IFNα (SRP4594; Sigma–Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) was used at 50 U/mL, within the range reported to be present in blood serum following IFNα‐2b/Ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C patients.40 LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype minnesota (Re 595, L9764; Sigma–Aldrich) was used at 10 ng/mL, which is just maximal for inducible proinflammatory gene expression.28 MDM cultures from each of the 6 individuals were stimulated with IFNα or LPS for 7 or 24 h, or incubated for 24 h with no inflammatory stimulus as a control. Parallel cultures included 100 μM indomethacin (Sigma–Aldrich), 1 μM prednisolone (Sigma–Aldrich), 5 μg IgG1 anti‐TNFα antibody (MAB610; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany), 100 nM escitalopram (Sigma–Aldrich), 1 μM nortriptyline (Sigma–Aldrich), or IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) in DMSO at the times indicated (7 or 24 h). Data supporting the rationale and optimization of inflammatory challenge and drug doses on cell viability assays are provided in Supplemental Materials and Methods. We noted that the dose of both monoaminergic drugs (escitalopram and nortriptyline) was limited by their cytotoxic effects on MDMs in vitro (Supplemental Fig. S2).2.4Optimization of inflammatory stimulation and drug concentrationsCell viability was measured to optimize the concentrations of drugs used (other than anti‐TNFα). This was performed using CellTiter‐Glo (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96‐well, flat‐bottomed white‐walled plates (Corning Ltd., Wiesbaden, Germany) and cultured in 100 μL media. Following maturation and consequent drug treatment, 100 μL CellTiter‐Glo was added to each well (1:1 ratio) and the plate was placed on a shaker for 10 min. Luminescence was measured in technical triplicates using a GloMax®96‐ Microplate Luminometer (Promega) and percentage of viable cells after each treatment was calculated relative to the untreated control culture. Six biologic replicates were used to test escitalopram (SSRI) and nortriptyline (TCA), 3 for indomethacin and prednisolone. Supplemental Figs. S2A and B display the cell viability in the presence of escitalopram or nortriptyline at 24 h post‐treatment. To ensure maximal drug contact with the cells without affecting viability, concentrations of 100 nM for nortriptyline and 1 μM for escitalopram were selected for the transcriptomics studies. These concentrations are higher than peak whole blood concentrations of escitalopram (∼0.1 nM41) or nortriptyline (50 nM42) in patients. Supplemental Figs. S2C and D show cell viability was not significantly affected by any of the tested concentrations of indomethacin or prednisolone. We therefore selected concentrations of 100 μM indomethacin and 1 μM prednisolone, as used in previous in vitro studies of macrophages.43, 44 The amount of anti‐TNFα antibody used was calculated to be 5 μg/mL. This was based on the suppliers ND50 value of 0.01–0.04 μg/mL in the presence of 0.75 ng/mL TNFα and our own measurements of maximum TNFα production from stimulated macrophages (<30 ng/mL). We then used the following equation to calculate the amount of antibody required: 
KD=[ mAb ][ Target ][ Complex ].IFNα (SRP4594, Sigma–Aldrich) was supplemented at 50 U/mL as this concentration yields a robust inflammatory response in macrophages and is within the range reported to be present in blood serum following IFNα‐2b/Ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C patients.40 Although many in vitro studies typically use 100 ng/mL of LPS, we used 10 ng/mL in order to consistently stimulate the cells for 24 h without obscuring any of the subtler downstream signaling effects (LPS from S. enterica serotype minnesota Re 595, L9764; Sigma–Aldrich).The final parameters for the experiment involving MDM, inflammatory stimuli and drug treatments are outlined in Supplemental Fig. 1A. Each of the MDM cultures from 6 different individuals were treated separately with each of the 3 anti‐inflammatory drugs, 2 antidepressants, vehicle control, or left untreated. Samples were then stimulated with either IFNα or LPS for either 7 or 24 h, or incubated for 24 h with no inflammatory stimulus as a control. RNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed by expression microarray2.5RNA extraction and processingRNA was prepared using RNeasy column‐based extraction (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). 350 μL of RNeasy buffer RLT was used per sample to extract RNA, which was eluted from the column in water following on‐column DNase treatment. RNA quality was subsequently analyzed using a 2200 Tapestation (Agilent, Edinburgh, UK). For expression microarrays, 500 ng of RNA was prepared using standard Affymetrix protocols and applied to the Human Gene 2.1 ST array by Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh, UK).2.6Expression data analysisAnalysis was performed using R/Bioconductor packages “arrayQualityMetrics,”45 “oligo,”46 and “nlme.”47 Normalization was performed using RMA.48 Probesets were collapsed down to a single gene. These data are available on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE85333).Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at each of the post‐inflammatory challenge time points (LPS or IFN at 7 or 24 h) were first estimated by a linear mixed effects model with inflammatory challenge as a fixed effect and donor (participant) as a random effect. To test the hypothesis that drug treatment significantly modulated the genomic response to inflammatory challenge, we extended the linear mixed effects model to include both inflammatory challenge and drug treatment as fixed effects, the interaction between challenge and drug as a fixed effect, and donor as a random effect. This model was fit to data from the second (24 h) post‐inflammatory time point. Tests for significance of all linear model coefficients are reported at uncorrected false‐positive rates of P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001 as indicated.Network analysis was performed using Graphia Professional software (Kajeka Ltd., Edinburgh, UK) to explore inflammation‐ and drug‐related transcriptional changes in the context of the transcriptome. Reactome software was used49 for enrichment analysis of DEGs previously implicated in neuronal signaling or depression.2.7Quantitation of selected neurotransmitter metabolitesTo confirm the predicted metabolic effects of these treatments on the expression of genes related to tryptophan metabolism, tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations were measured by HPLC/MS in the supernatant of cells after 24 h incubation (Supplemental Materials).2.8Quantitation of cytokine production in sample supernatantsTo compare protein production to transcript levels, cytokine production was measured in the supernatant of cells by use of TNF‐α (#KAC1751) and IL‐6 (#KHC0061C) ELISA kits (ThermoFisher, Runcorn, UK). Precoated plates were used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plates were blocked for nonspecific binding. Supernatants, or standard controls, were then allowed to bind to the precoated antibodies before washing and addition of a secondary HRP‐conjugated antibody. Absorbance was read at 450 nm by a plate reader and cytokine concentration was calculated from the standard curve.3RESULTS3.1Transcriptional regulation in MDM by LPS and IFNαLPS significantly modulated the expression of 3294 genes and IFNα challenge 743 genes in human MDM, consistent with previous observations.24, 27, 50 Both challenges showed the greatest effect at 7 h (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table S1). As previously observed in mouse macrophages,28 IFNα responsive genes were largely a subset of the LPS response: approximately 2 out of 3 of the IFNα responsive genes were also differentially expressed following LPS treatment. A sample‐to‐sample correlation network (Fig. 2) demonstrated that samples grouped together according to stimulus. Notably, the 7 h LPS samples were most distant (least correlated with) from the control samples. In keeping with evidence that LPS‐inducible genes in monocytes can be treated as quantitative traits with extensive variation between individuals,51 samples from the same donor tended to be in the same neighborhood.Figure 2Network analysis of the effects of inflammatory challenge and drug treatment on the transcriptome. Sample‐sample correlation network constructed from the normalized microarray dataset colored according to (A) inflammatory stimulus or (B) by donor. Nodes represent samples within the dataset and edges represent correlations between samples greater than the threshold (r > 0.96). Samples closer to each other are more similar (highly correlated). Separation of the samples is observed by inflammatory stimulus and by donor. (C) A gene–gene correlation network constructed from DEGs from the microarray dataset (r > 0.93). Nodes represent genes which cluster together based on their pattern of expression. (D) Mean signal intensity of the genes in 9 of the largest clusters are displayed on the right with GO functional enrichment terms (numbered in order of size)A network model of the transcriptional network was constructed in which each of 3034 nodes represent a DEG and the edges connecting nodes represented a strong positive correlation (r > 0.93) between gene expression profiles across all the samples in the dataset (Fig. 2C). Genes with a similar expression profile tended to group closely together. Regulated genes grouped into 9 major clusters of strongly co‐expressed genes: 4 clusters of genes that were up‐regulated and 5 clusters of down‐regulated genes (Fig. 2D).3.2Effects of monoaminergic antidepressant drugs on whole transcriptomeAt the nontoxic doses used in this study, neither antidepressant drug had a significant effect on the macrophage response to either LPS or IFNα (Supplemental Fig. S3).3.3Effects of anti‐inflammatory drugs on whole transcriptomeConsistent with their different modes of action, each of the anti‐inflammatory drugs influenced the response to LPS or IFNα in a distinct manner. For example, each drug had a specific effect on the transcription profile of 3 classical inflammatory genes (IL1B, IL6, and TNF) induced by LPS or IFNα challenge (Figs. 3A–F). These data were confirmed at the protein level as measurement of the corresponding cytokine in the supernatants of these same samples (Supplemental Fig. S4) reflected patterns observed at the gene level. A complete list of the DEGs associated with the responses to the two inflammatory stimuli, and the effect of each drug treatment is provided in Supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 3G, respectively. The Venn diagrams (Figs. 3H and I) further illustrate how each drug affected the inflammatory response in a unique manner. Drug modulated genes were visualized in the context of the gene network as a whole (Figs. 3J–L), demonstrating prednisolone and the anti‐TNF antibody act predominantly by reducing the expression of genes that were up‐regulated, or increasing the expression of genes that were down‐regulated by the proinflammatory stimuli. Enrichment analysis confirmed that the genes regulated by LPS or IFNα, and modulated by drug treatment, were functionally important for immune signaling and related to the mechanisms of drug action; see Supplemental Table S1 for a summary and Supplemental Table S3 for details. The effect of indomethacin was more complex than simply inhibiting the responses to LPS and IFNα, consistent with the known ability to prevent expression of prostaglandins, which act as feedback inhibitors of gene expression.52 In many cases, it appeared to further elevate the expression of genes already up‐ or down‐regulated, particularly those associated with lipid metabolism.Figure 3Anti‐inflammatory drug effects on inflammation‐induced gene expression. The expression intensity of IL1β (A, D), IL6 (B, E), and TNF (C, F) are displayed following treatment with anti‐inflammatory drugs or vehicle control and LPS (A–C) or IFNα (D–F) challenge. The numbers of genes differentially expressed by the interaction of anti‐inflammatory drug treatment and proinflammatory challenge, and their direction of change when compared with control‐treated samples, are displayed in a table (G) and as Venn diagrams for each drug (H, I). These DEGs were overlaid on the gene–gene correlation network from Fig. 2: red = genes overexpressed by drug treatment, blue = genes underexpressed by drug treatment. Genes significantly modulated by anti‐TNFα treatment (J), indomethacin treatment (K), and prednisolone treatment (L) are displayed separately.3.4Regulated expression of genes involved in tryptophan metabolismAmongst the many genes that demonstrated a significant interaction between the two inflammatory stimuli and drug treatment, we focused on pathways for tryptophan catabolism and transport. This pathway relates to the prior hypothesis that tryptophan metabolism could be a key mechanism linking peripheral inflammation to depression.10, 20, 53 A schematic representation of this metabolic pathway is illustrated in Fig. 4.Figure 4Effects of proinflammatory challenge and anti‐inflammatory drugs on expression of genes related to tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism. The pathway model summarizes the metabolic role of 8 proteins involved in tryptophan transport or catabolism as illustrated. The profile of expression changes for each gene following proinflammatory challenge is shown by the line graphs during each drug treatment. Significance is depicted for every significant interaction of anti‐inflammatory drug treatment with proinflammatory challenge, and color coded for each drug treatment. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01Both LPS and IFNα caused significant changes in the expression of genes encoding enzyme or transporter proteins that play crucial roles in the metabolism of tryptophan. LPS caused a pronounced up‐regulation of genes encoding 2 tryptophan transporters (SLC16A10 and SLC7A5), and up‐regulation of genes coding enzymes on the pathway to kynurenine and its metabolites (IDO1, KYNU, and KMO). LPS also caused significant down‐regulation of genes coding kynurenine metabolic enzymes (AFMID and CCBL7). Other tryptophan transporters in human macrophages, the heavy chain Y+L SLC3A2 (CD98) and SLC7A7 are expressed constitutively at high levels.27 IFNα challenge resulted in a similar profile of effects on the expression of genes encoding the kynurenine metabolic enzymes, but did not produce significant elevation of the tryptophan transporter genes (Fig. 4).Anti‐inflammatory drugs significantly modulated the on the inducible expression of genes encoding serotonin transporters and kynurenine metabolic enzymes. Interestingly, the direction of change in gene expression caused by anti‐inflammatory drug treatment was always opposite in sign to the change caused by activating stimulus. In other words, 4 of the 5 genes that were up‐regulated in response to challenge (SLC16A10, SLC7A5, IDO1, and KYNU), were less strongly induced after drug treatments; and all 3 genes that were down‐regulated in response to challenge (SLC7A8, AFMID, and CCBL7) were less strongly repressed (Fig. 4).Thus, all anti‐inflammatory drugs tested were found to impact tryptophan‐ or kynurenine‐related gene expression. Indomethacin had effects mainly on tryptophan transporter genes; prednisolone on kynurenine metabolism genes; and anti‐TNFα on both class of genes.3.5Effects of macrophage activators (LPS, IFNα) and drugs on tryptophan‐related metabolite concentrationsIn keeping with the gene expression data, LPS treatment led to 70–80% depletion of tryptophan in the medium and accumulation of kynurenine. IFNα exerted a similar effect, but the magnitude of change in these metabolites was less. Of the three anti‐inflammatory drugs tested, only indomethacin significantly attenuated LPS‐induced reduction in tryptophan availability (Fig. 5). Both anti‐TNFα and indomethacin significantly reduced kynurenine production to ∼70% and ∼50% following IFNα stimulation but did not reduce kynurenine following LPS treatment (Fig. 5). The kynurenine to tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratio was used as a measure of tryptophan catabolism overall (Fig. 5). Anti‐TNFα treatment significantly moderated IFNα‐induced increases in Kyn/Trp (P = 0.018); and indomethacin treatment likewise significantly moderated LPS‐induced increases in the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (P = 0.026).Figure 5Metabolomic analysis of effects of inflammatory challenge and anti‐inflammatory drug treatment on tryptophan concentration and tryptophan/kynurenine concentration ratio.

Significance was calculated using a ratio paired t test. *P < 0.05 **P < 0.0014DISCUSSIONEvidence for a link between systemic inflammatory disease and depression (or depressive behavior in animals3, 5) is now overwhelming.2 We investigated the effects of LPS or IFNα challenge on gene expression by CSF1‐cultured MDMs. The scale of the transcriptional response to LPS and IFNα in these data was comparable to previous studies. LPS is itself known to induce type 1 IFNs (mainly IFNβ) in MDM, which act in an autocrine manner via IFNAR1, itself induced by LPS.27 Accordingly, the response to exogenous type 1 IFN (IFNα) was largely a subset of the LPS response, as reported in previous studies.24, 28, 50, 51, 54 None of the anti‐inflammatory agents we examined completely prevented the response to either challenge and, although prednisolone and anti‐TNFα both reduced expression of many genes that were up‐ or down‐regulated by the inflammatory challenges, each had a distinctive transcriptional effect. This diversity likely reflects the complex feed‐forward and negative feedback loops that characterize the response to LPS27, 55 and the different mode of action of each drug.Both stimuli greatly increased expression (∼3000 fold following LPS) of the gene encoding the enzyme indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO1). IDO1 catalyzes the primary reaction in conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine; thereby reducing its availability as a precursor for serotonin metabolism. While this process has been associated with immunosuppression through Treg activation and effector T cell suppression,56 inflammation‐induced expression of this enzyme leads to tryptophan depletion both locally and systemically in chronic inflammatory states and has also been linked to alterations in mood.5, 53, 57 Similarly, the ability of host microbiota to control tryptophan metabolism has been functionally linked to influencing mood.58 Furthermore, polymorphisms in IDO1 have been associated with susceptibility to IFNα‐induced depression in hepatitis patients.59 This may arise both from the depletion of tryptophan, and the generation of neurotoxic metabolites such as kynurenine.5, 60 However, tryptophan depletion in depressed patients was reportedly independent of kynurenine pathway activation.61
Anti‐TNFα reduced transcription of tryptophan catabolism enzymes, IDO1 and KYNU, following IFNα stimulation but no significant effect of the drug was observed on these elements following LPS treatment. This is likely due to the transient induction of feed‐forward and negative feedback loops of TNFα transcription following inflammatory stimulus. Like IFNα, TNFα was predicted to be involved in an autocrine loop in MDM elicited by LPS, since the TNFα receptor is also induced.27 Our data (Supplemental Table S2) confirm and extend evidence of autocrine TNFα signaling as a feed‐forward activator of macrophage gene expression30, 62, 63 and identify the subset of inducible genes dependent upon that stimulus. The lack of impact of anti‐TNFα on LPS‐inducible IDO1 may reflect the magnitude of the response. Alternatively, activation of IDO1 by IFN‐γ requires co‐stimulation by TNFα, which increases the occupancy of IFN‐response elements.64, 65 It may be that LPS provides this second signal independently of TNFα.30, 62, 63
A study examining the treatment of primary murine hippocampal cells with ibuprofen, a nonselective COX inhibitor like indomethacin, identified TDO2 as the most significantly affected gene.66 TDO2, which is not expressed in macrophages, acts like IDO1 to metabolize tryptophan to kynurenic metabolites. However, although anti‐TNFα and prednisolone each significantly reduced IDO1 activity at 24 h post‐IFNα stimulation, indomethacin treatment did not. Indomethacin did, however, significantly reduce transcription of tryptophan transporters induced by both inflammatory challenges, potentially reducing the availability of intracellular tryptophan as a substrate for IDO1. In contrast, anti‐TNFα treatment reduced transcription of one tryptophan transporter while increasing transcription of another during LPS challenge, and prednisolone did not affect the mRNA levels of any transporter.To directly assess tryptophan uptake and catabolism following each treatment, we measured the concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenine in the supernatant. Indomethacin was the only inhibitor that impacted tryptophan levels during LPS challenge, likely due to a transcription repression of the tryptophan transporter. Prednisolone, while modulating expression of numerous inducible genes, did not produce any alteration in overall tryptophan catabolism (Supplemental Fig. S5), despite reducing expression of tryptophan catabolism‐related genes such as IDO1, KYNU, and CCBL1.A recent review examined the anti‐inflammatory effects of antidepressant drugs.67 We found no evidence that either of the monoaminergic antidepressant drugs tested (TCA or SSRI) exerted any effect on the response in MDMs to LPS or IFNα. This is in contrast to reports that TCAs reduce proinflammatory signaling in phagocytes,68 and SSRIs have been reported to alter macrophage differentiation and inflammatory signaling.67, 69 SSRIs have also been reported to modulate glucocorticoid actions on monocytes.70 Although we found no direct effect of SSRIs or TCAs on macrophage responses to either LPS or IFNα, we did observe significant cytotoxicity at concentrations that were <20‐fold lower than circulating blood concentrations in treated patients. In support of this, nortriptyline has previously been shown to induce autophagy in macrophages.39 Indeed, many antidepressants are cationic amphipaths, and are therefore lysosomotropic71 likely accumulating selectively in phagocytic cells. Selective toxicity to macrophages may therefore contribute to the results reported in other studies, which used far higher concentrations of SSRIs than used here.69
There is already some evidence that anti‐inflammatory drugs can have antidepressant efficacy.32 Our results are compatible with the mechanistic interpretation that this may be at least partly attributable to the effects of anti‐inflammatory drugs on “normalization” of an inflammation‐induced bias in tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism. However, the results also indicate that this is unlikely to be the sole mechanism, and each agent may produce distinct patterns of regulation of genes that can impact indirectly on neuronal function expression. If each anti‐inflammatory agent is distinct in its actions, it may be that combinations would have novel potential efficacy.Supporting informationThe antidepressants (top) act through blocking receptors for neuroactive agents. Escitalopram blocks the 5‐HT transporter preventing uptake and subsequent degradation of 5‐HT. Nortriptyline acts by blocking the histamine, cholinergic, muscarinic and β2‐adrenergic receptors and is believed to primarily block noradrenaline signaling, which results in less 5HT uptake. This results in a relative increase of 5‐HT available in the brain, thus improving mood. Inflammatory stimuli used in the assay, LPS and IFNα, are depicted at the bottom of the diagram. IFNα is recognised by its receptor inducing an inflammatory response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. LPS is detected through the TLR4 complex and induces a powerful inflammatory response, which also involves production of TNFα and IFNβ which contribute to the overall response to LPS. Prednisolone (upper right) forms a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor and translocates to the nucleus. From here, the receptor ligand complex is known to up‐regulate anti‐inflammatory gene expression. In addition, it prevents inflammatory gene transcription via the NF‐κB transcription factor, RelA, in response to inflammatory stimuli such LPS or IFNα. TNFα is a powerful inflammatory cytokine, which is involved in autocrine signaling during inflammation, further driving the response. Anti‐TNFα antibodies (lower left) neutralise TNFα, preventing autocrine signaling and reducing further transcription of inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory response also up‐regulates prostaglandin synthases which further increase inflammation. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin synthases preventing inflammation from prostaglandin autocrine loops (right).Click here for additional data file.Fully differentiated hMDMs (day 8) were incubated for 24 h in various concentrations of the drugs indicated; nortriptyline (A), escitalopram (B), indomethacin (C) or prednisolone (D).

A high prevalence (25–40%) of SSD has been found in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), which is known for T-cell deficits due to thymus hypoplasia. This study is the first to explore the association between the T-cell subsets and psychotic symptoms in adults with 22q11.2DS.Methods:34 individuals (aged 19–38 yrs.) with 22q11.2DS and 34 healthy age- and gender matched control individuals were included. FACS analysis of the blood samples was performed to define T-cell subsets. Ultra-high risk for psychosis or diagnosis of SSD was determined based on CAARMS interviews and DSM-5 criteria for SSD. Positive psychotic symptom severity was measured based on the PANSS positive symptoms subscale.Results:A partial T-cell immune deficiency in 22q11.2DS patients was confirmed by significantly reduced percentages of circulating T and T-helper cells. Significantly higher percentages of inflammatory Th1, Th17, and memory T-helper cells were found in adults with 22q11.2DS. Most importantly an increased Th17 percentage was found in adults with psychotic symptoms as compared to non-psychotic adults with 22q11.2DS, and Th17 percentage were related to the presence of positive psychotic symptoms.Conclusions:Given the literature on the role of T cells and in particular of Th17 cells and IL-17 in hippocampus development, cognition and behavior, these results support the hypothesis for a role of Th17 cells in the development and/or regulation of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS. This pilot study underlines the importance to further study the role of T-cell defects and of Th17 cells in the development of psychiatric symptoms. It also supports the possibility to use 22q11.2DS as a model to study T-cell involvement in the development of SSD.22q11.2 deletion syndromeSchizophrenia spectrum disorderTh17 cellsT-cell immune deficiencyPsychosisNeuro-inflammation"

The common marmoset is an ideal model as it has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort (n = 41; aged 3–27 months; scanned 2–7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact.myelinationspline trajectorytensor-based morphometryWellcome Trust10.13039/100010269108089/Z/15/ZMedical Research Council10.13039/501100000265MR/M023990/1Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience InstituteIntroductionDisorders of mental health affect up to half the population during their lifetime, but half of adult patients will already be diagnosed by age 14, rising to 75% by age 24. This is strongly suggestive of developmental factors in the pathogenesis of mental health disorders (Kessler et al. 2005; Keshavan et al. 2014). For example, disruption of the development of cortical and subcortical brain circuits underlying attention, decision making, mood and emotion likely contributes to early life incidence of psychiatric symptoms. Our current knowledge of the developmental trajectories of these circuits is, however, limited.Advances in pediatric MRI have enabled studies of human brain growth over time (Giedd et al. 1996; Gogtay et al. 2004; Shaw et al. 2008; Raznahan et al. 2011; Khundrakpam et al. 2017) with a particular focus on adolescence where mental health disorders have their greatest incidence (Paus et al. 2008). These studies reveal distinct trajectories of growth, often emphasizing the progressive then regressive periods of grey matter volume and cortical thickness that mirror the cytoarchitecture and evolutionary development of the cerebral cortex (Shaw et al. 2008) (but, see Walhovd et al. (2017), for discussion of contradictions regarding the existence of a progressive period in studies of cortical thickness). In all studies, higher-order association regions of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal lobes show later maturation compared with somatomotor regions of cortex. In contrast, white matter growth shows a steady increase well into adulthood. Given the long developmental window in humans spanning from birth to 21 years, the value of performing similar imaging studies in nonhuman primates with a more concentrated period of development is becoming recognized. Some progress has already been made in characterizing rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) brain development (Knickmeyer et al. 2010), with the most comprehensive study to date in 45 animals (Scott et al. 2016) which looked at developmental trajectories from 1 to 52 weeks across large subdivisions of the cerebrum (e.g., frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes) and subcortical regions including the brain stem. This study did not distinguish grey matter from white matter, but nevertheless identified the protracted growth of frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with human studies.More recently, the suitability of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, a small New World primate with a compact lifespan (10–15 years), has been recognized for studying all stages of development (Fig. 1) (Abbott et al. 2003; Schultz-Darken et al. 2016). Marmosets live in family groups, similar to humans, and exhibit human-like social behavior (Miller et al. 2016). They are an excellent primate species for neurobiological (Oikonomidis et al. 2017) and genetic studies (Kishi et al. 2014). Accordingly there have been a number of recent neuroimaging studies focusing on both prenatal and postnatal marmoset brain development (Hikishima et al. 2013; Seki et al. 2017) and histological studies of postnatal developmental changes (Bourne and Rosa 2006; Burman et al. 2007; Oga et al. 2013; Sasaki et al. 2015). Cortical grey matter volume in the marmoset brain demonstrates a similar inverted-U sequence of increase, plateau and decrease over developmental time as previously described for macaque and human brains.Figure 1.Developmental epochs in the life of the marmoset with broadly homologous periods in the human lifespan for comparison.Here we aimed to measure developmental changes in grey matter volume of the marmoset brain more comprehensively. We used spline models to quantify the nonlinear path of grey matter development at each of 53 neocortical areas defined by an anatomical template, and 16 major allocortical and subcortical structures, in each of 41 animals aged between 3 and 27 months. Each animal was scanned at least twice in an accelerated longitudinal design allowing us to model developmental changes from before puberty to early adulthood. We predicted that association cortex and subcortical nuclei would show a protracted time course of grey matter development compared with that of primary and secondary sensory and motor areas. Further, given that varied changes in prefrontal function and structure are associated with nearly all neuropsychiatric conditions, we hypothesized that prefrontal cortex may comprise a particularly heterogeneous collection of growth curves with distinctive developmental profiles.Materials and MethodsAnimalsAll procedures were in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under licence PPL70/7618 and approved by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board.The design adopted was a compromise between a pure longitudinal design and a cross-sectional design. In designing a study of this type, there must be a trade off between focussing heavily on particular individuals or scanning widely across a population. The longitudinal assessment of individuals is crucial for unmasking details of the developmental trajectories. However, by including data from many individuals we have been able to additionally capture the variability in the population more widely. In this way, our design captures trajectory details that are more likely to generalize to the population. Images were obtained from 3 to 27 months at quarterly intervals. Cohorts of a minimum of 15 animals were obtained between 3 and 21 months.Marmosets were all born and reared in the University of Cambridge marmoset colony. Animals were housed in family groups in rooms with controlled humidity (50%) and temperature (21 °C), with water available ad libitum. They were fed peanuts or Farley’s rusk in the morning and sandwiches (wholemeal bread, marmoset jelly [Special Diet Services, Essex, UK] hardboiled egg), and 2 pieces of fruit in the evening. Besides MRI scans as detailed below, marmosets in this study did not undergo any other experimental procedures while part of this study.On the day of scanning, animals were fasted. Marmosets were sedated with ketamine (20 mg/kg; Vetalar solution 100 mg/mL Pfizer, Kent, UK) and intubated for isoflurane anesthesia (2.5% in 0.25–0.40 L/min O2). Throughout scanning, respiration rates were monitored with a pressure sensor over the upper abdomen (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY) and the isoflurane dose was adjusted between 1% and 3% to maintain respiratory rates in the normal range. A rectal thermometer was used to monitor temperature and a flowing-water heating system was adjusted as necessary. Marmosets were returned to their home cages once recovered.Marmosets were regularly assessed for health, including monthly weighing, as part of the normal colony procedures. No adverse health events were recorded for any of the animals in this study.We scanned 41 animals a total of 147 times with an average of 3.7 scans per animal (range 1–7 scans; n = 38, 33, 19, 10, 45, 1 having ≥2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 scans, respectively).Image Acquisition and ProcessingAnimals were scanned using a Bruker PharmaScan 47/16 MRI system (Bruker, Inc., Ettlingen, Germany) at a field strength of 4.7 T. A custom 6 cm birdcage coil was used for signal transmission and reception. Structural images were acquired using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence (parameters: TR/TEeff 11 750/23.5 ms, 125 slices of 250 μm thickness, echo train length 4 and 3 averages) in 21 m 44 s. The field of view was 64 mm × 50 mm yielding an isotropic resolution of 250 μm.Images were processed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, UCL, UK) with the SPMMouse toolbox for animal data (Sawiak et al. 2013). Brains were aligned with tissue probability maps derived from marmosets from the same colony (Mikheenko et al. 2015) and segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (GM, WM, and CSF). DARTEL (Ashburner 2007) was used for image registration and to create population templates. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) was used to find volume differences at 3 stages: “prepubertal” (changes from 3 to 6 months), “pubertal” (between 6 and 12 months), and “postpubertal” (between 12–21 months). Jacobian determinant maps for each scan were produced from the DARTEL flow fields and smoothed with an 800 μm isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel. A general linear model was used with a block design for ages at 3-month intervals, including covariates for sex, subjects (i.e., a random effect for each marmoset), and total intracranial volume (TIV) so as to remove changes that can be explained by overall brain volume. Additionally, to assess sex differences, a block design was used to compare male and female animals within each age block.Mean warped images were calculated from all subjects and time points, in addition to separate average images made from brain scans in 3-month intervals from 3 to 21 months. These quarterly maps were segmented and registered with DARTEL to create deformation fields between them so that a movie could be made to simulate a continuous transition of brain structures from infancy to adulthood (Supplementary Movie 1).With DARTEL, linear elastic regularization was used with the default parameters. Smoothing parameters were adjusted for the marmoset brain (for the 6 iterations: 0.034, 0.017, 0.008, 0.004, 0.002, and 0.001).An adjusted P-value was used to control the type I error rate expected due to multiple comparisons, calculated for a false-discovery rate (Genovese et al. 2002) of q < 0.05. Two-tailed tests were calculated in each case.Cortical Parcellation of Brain RegionsCortical brain regions were defined by adapting a digital reference template based on histological sections of the marmoset brain (Majka et al. 2016), itself based on a comprehensive atlas (Paxinos et al. 2012). The unilateral labels of this dataset were flipped symmetrically about the midline to produce a symmetric atlas of the entire cortex. The cortex of the structural (DARTEL) MRI template derived from all the scanned brains in this study was manually delineated as a whole and image registration was used to find the best affine mapping to a mask corresponding to the histologically labeled data. Each voxel of the MRI cortex mask was then assigned to the nearest corresponding labeled voxel from the histological dataset.The original histological atlas comprised 116 regions, many of which were distinguished on the basis of detailed cytoarchitecture or functional differences that are not evident in the MRI data. Particularly for small, ill-defined (in terms of MRI contrast) areas, including this level of detail would be unwarranted. For this reason, the original histological atlas was simplified such that subdivisions of Brodmann areas were not considered separately. A complete list of regions is given in Supplementary Table S1.The cerebellum, subcortical and allocortical structures including the head (ventromedial and dorsolateral nuclei) and body of the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala (basolateral and central nuclei), medial thalamic nucleus, septum, hypothalamus, and the anterior aspects of the hippocampus were delineated using Analyze 8 (Mayo Clinic) by an expert reviewer (ACR) with reference to a histological atlas (Paxinos et al. 2012). Additional structures segmented included the habenula and raphe nuclei (dorsal and medial).Regional Growth Trajectory AnalysisThe volumes of 69 symmetric cortical, subcortical, and allocortical regions and 3 regions across the midline were estimated by integrating Jacobian determinants from the DARTEL transformations over each region mask. No filtering based on tissue segmentation was used in this process. An additive mixed model was used to model these volumes using cubic splines (Alexander-Bloch et al. 2014) with all computations performed in Matlab 2016b (Mathworks, Inc.). The volume of the ith structure in the jth subject, Vi,j at age t is modeled as follows:
(1)Vi,j(t)=βsSi+fi(t)+ui,jwhere Si=1 for female subjects and 0 for male subjects and fi(t) is the same function of age for all subjects, giving the fitted spline for each structure. ui,j is the random effect of subject (here an additive constant: varying by structure and subject but not with time).The process of fitting this model is illustrated in Figure 2. The spline fits are based on the sum of cubic b-splines, a set of smooth local basis functions each of which is adjusted to best fit the data. Each adjusted function only affects the fit in the vicinity of its time point, or “knot.” The functions used here were penalized splines with a constant smoothing factor (Shaw et al. 2008). Following (Alexander-Bloch et al. 2014) we used 10 knots over the age range of interest (3–24 months). Further knots with the same spacing were included outside of this range to avoid spurious edge effects.Figure 2.Growth trajectory modeling using total intracranial volume (TIV) for illustrative purposes. The effect of subject is modeled as an additive constant to the growth trajectory which is fitted with B splines. Raw data (A) is shown with subject effects (i.e., the mean of each subject trajectory) removed (B) and the fitted spline in (C). The basis functions for this curve are shown in (D), each is adjusted to best fit the data. As each adjustment is local, it only has an effect in its vicinity or “knot.” The spline derivative is shown in (E), highlighting the rate of change of TIV. Vertical lines shown in (C) and (E) indicate how a zero in the derivative corresponds to a maximum volume (6 months) and how the minimum of the derivative curve (at 15 months) coincides with the greatest rate of volume loss in (C). The functions used here were based on a penalized spline calculated with a constant smoothing factor. Gradient descent with linear least squares minimization was used to fit the additive model, iteratively updating subject offsets and spline coefficients to minimize the squared errors.Based on the inverted-U shape of these trajectories, we defined 3 key milestones. All of the regions show growth from infancy, reaching a peak as either a sharp, well-defined maximum or a longer plateau, before the volume starts to decrease. The 3 milestones capturing this feature were defined as follows: 1) the age at peak volume, 2) the age at onset of volume decline, and 3) the age at maximum rate of volume decline. Milestones were estimated using the first derivative of the spline grey matter volume change in each region. At the peak, the first derivative is zero. By bootstrap resampling, 95% confidence intervals were obtained for the age at which the derivative was not zero. The age of onset of decline was defined as the upper limit of that interval. Finally, the age at maximum rate of decline coincides with the time of the minimum of the first derivative curve for each structure. To maintain the nested structure of the data, bootstrap resampling was performed over scans, preserving identity information to allow individual subject offsets to be taken into account for the analysis.Trajectory ClusteringWe used cluster analysis to subdivide the marmoset cortex into a few large systems or families of cortical areas sharing a distinctively similar developmental profile. At each of the first few levels of this neurodevelopmental hierarchy we found corresponding k-means clustering solutions with k in the range 2–10. These could be compared with each other in terms of the cluster-wise mean volume trajectory and also in terms of the 3 milestones of cortical volume change.Briefly, the k-means method randomly allocates feature vectors from each region (in this case, the vector of spline coefficients defining each areal trajectory) to one of k distinct clusters, which are subsequently updated as the mean of all their allocated regions. Each region is then reassigned to its nearest cluster and the process repeated until it converges. All computations were performed using the algorithms of the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox with Matlab 2016b (Mathworks, Inc.).There is no consensus on how to determine an “optimal” number of clusters to describe complex datasets and we therefore explored results over a range of values of k. We focused on k = 6 because this was the largest number of clusters for which each cluster was significantly different from all other clusters in terms of at least 1 developmental milestone (see Supplementary Fig. S2).Cerebral AsymmetryTo assess cerebral asymmetry, trajectories were computed for left and right hemisphere ROIs independently, using equation 1 as before.Further, for a voxel-based analysis, the population templates produced by DARTEL were processed by reflecting the data in the left–right direction, using a rigid registration (computed by SPM8) to align the original and reflected templates, and averaging them together resulting in a symmetric template. Each scan was then warped to match the symmetric target with DARTEL to produce Jacobian determinants (i.e., volume change) maps. Left–right differences were computed by subtracting a reflected copy from each map such that positive values would indicate larger volumes compared with the corresponding contralateral region. These asymmetry maps were tested with a 2-tailed t-test (P < 0.05 FDR-corrected, as for the tensor-based morphometry analysis) at 3, 12, and 21 months.ResultsThe body mass of animals measured at each scan is shown in Figure 3, approximately doubling (+122%, P = 1 × 10−21; 95% CI: 108–136%) pre-to-post puberty (3–12 months), approaching a plateau (a further increase of 11% is seen from 12 to 15 months, P = 0.005, 95% CI: 4–19%) before stabilizing from 12 to 24 months. Brain volumes do not share the same trajectory (Fig. 3C–E). TIV (here calculated as the sum of segmented GM, WM, and CSF portions) increases by 7% in the prepubertal stage (3–6 months, P = 3.8 × 10−4, 95% CI: 3.4–10.6%), with total GM volume increasing by 3.7% (P = 0.05, 95% CI 0.1–7%) and total WM volume increasing by 28% (P = 1 × 10−9, 95% CI: 21–35%). During puberty (6–12 months), GM volume falls by 5% (P = 0.001, 95% CI: 2–8%) but WM volume increases by 11% (P = 7 × 10−5, 95 CI% 6–16%). Postpuberty (12–21 months), WM volume appears to plateau (increasing 4%, P = 0.2, 95% CI: −2% to 10%), whereas GM volume falls by a further 9% (P = 7 × 10−8, 95% CI: 6–11%). TIV in the same period decreases by 6% (P = 6 × 10−4, 95% CI: 3–9%). Further age-related changes in GM/WM volumes were evident by inspection of the average image at each of the seven 3-month epochs from 3–6 to 21–24 months (Figs 4 and 5 and Supplementary Movie 1). WM grows and its signal becomes more distinct over time, with complementary attenuation or shrinkage of anatomically adjacent GM signals in cortex and subcortical nuclei.Figure 3(A) Ages of each marmoset scanned. (B) Total body mass. (C) Intracranial volume. (D) Total grey matter volume. (E) Total white matter volume. The solid vertical line marks the mean age of puberty in the animals for reference.Figure 4.Sections from mean templates of animals produced at regular intervals from 3 to 21 months, from prepuberty, through puberty and postpubertal stages from left to right. With the imaging parameters chosen, WM yields the darkest intensity, followed by GM and then CSF yields the brightest. Changes in WM are apparent at each age point: not only does it appear markedly thicker, but darker with time. Visually it appears to increase in volume at the expense of surrounding GM. Marked increases in white matter include that within the prefrontal cortex (coronal sections: top row), internal capsule (middle row 2) and corpus callosum (bottom row) and the anterior commissure (horizontal sessions: top row) and visual cortices (bottom row). Changes with age are readily appreciated visually with the simulated development movie (Supplementary Movie 1). Coronal sections are taken at 14, 6, and -2 mm from the intra-aural line, horizontal sections at 0 and 3.5 mm from the AC–PC line, indicated at the 12 m template. Scale bar is 5 mm.Figure 5.Tensor-based morphometry results showing regions where volume increases or decreases between different stages are not explained by TIV changes. The color bar shows Student’s T-score and all changes shown are significant at an adjusted threshold for P < 0.05 (false-discovery rate; 2-tailed). The scale bar shows 5 mm. The top row of each timepoint shows coronal sections (slices progressing anterior to posterior) and the second row shows axial sections (superior to inferior).We used tensor based morphometry (TBM) to assess the statistical significance of age-related changes in grey and white matter between the 3 major phases of prepuberty (3–6 months), puberty (6–12 months), and postpuberty (12–21 months) (Fig. 5). Areas of volume growth and reduction are shown with different color scales. In each map, relative volume reductions are virtually all in grey matter regions, with corresponding increases in white matter regions. Prepuberty, GM changes are particularly striking in the frontal cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, and medial aspects of primary visual cortex. During this stage of development, major white matter tracts change substantially, most clearly in the anterior commissure, at the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Except for the corpus callosum, it is generally WM in more inferior parts of the forebrain that shows significant change during this time period.Later, during puberty, the differences are much more significant throughout the brain. Now, prefrontal cortex shows less change, but sensory and motor cortices show significant reductions in GM. Occipital GM has the most substantial volume loss, with the entirety of primary visual cortex V1 and V2 showing marked changes in this period (these differences are also clear from visual inspection of Fig. 4). In terms of WM, tracts thickening in the prepubertal period continue to do so but are joined by the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the external capsule. The corticospinal tracts and midbrain WM also increase in size.Postpuberty, the trend of decreasing GM in favor of increasing WM continues. Subcortical GM is seen to change prominently for the first time, most clearly in the putamen. Anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, particularly in the inferior aspects, continue to undergo significant GM loss but more lateral regions of the parietal and occipital cortices show fewer differences in this period. As during puberty, medial regions of visual cortex continue to change but at this point it is more focussed within the inferior aspects.No significant sex differences were detected at any age point in total body mass, GM, WM, or TIV; nor using TBM within each age block. This is consistent with previous studies in marmosets (Sakai T et al. 2017), but diverges from differences reported in humans (Giedd et al. 1996). It may be that more subtle findings could exist and be detected with a larger cohort at all age points. It is not straightforward to sex marmosets at 3 months and unfortunately we had only 4 of 17 female marmosets at this age. Looking specifically at 12 months, however, in a comparison of 12 female versus 19 male animals there were no significant volume differences seen with TBM. These are reasonable group sizes for comparison, implying that any sexual dimorphism in brain volume that does exist is relatively minor. We therefore only report results for pooled (male and female) data.Bootstrap confidence intervals for left and right hemispheres overlapped at every time point for every ROI tested, indicating no significant asymmetry in the brain visible at an ROI level. In the voxel-based analysis, a small yet consistently significant region of the posterior inferior aspects of hippocampus showed a greater volume on the right at 3, 12, and 21 months (Supplementary Fig. S1) as did the left Sylvian fissure. A longer left Sylvian fissure, compared with the right, was found in the brains of 4 of 5 species of New World monkey (including marmosets) studied at post mortem by (Heilbroner and Holloway 1988). However, this finding was not reproduced in an MRI study of 2 of these species by (Pilcher et al. 2001), which incidentally does provide a useful survey of laterality studies and their conflicting results in nonhuman primates. The only other areas of asymmetry were found in the dorsolateral putamen at 12 and 21 months and the ventrolateral and ventroposterior thalamus at 21 months only.Trajectory AnalysisInspection of the growth trajectories revealed a number of features that differentiate cortical regions during development (Fig. 6). For illustrative purposes, the fitted curves of the splines and their derivatives are shown for a primary sensory area, V1, and a higher association area, 13, in prefrontal cortex. A complete set of trajectories for every brain region is provided in Supplementary Material. Brain maps of these key developmental milestones highlight marked differences within cortical lobes as well as between cortical and subcortical regions (Fig. 6). The initial peak volume (I) for all cortical structures is just prior to, or during the early stages of puberty (5–7 months). This feature discriminates between primary and association cortex, particularly within visual cortex, with V1 peaking first (month 5), and a trend to later peaks for V3, V4, and V5 (month 6), but not so for V6 (month 5.4), consistent with the view that this area is distinct from V3 (Angelucci and Rosa 2015). Primary motor and somatosensory cortices peak shortly after V1, months 6.0 and 5.9, respectively, whilst primary auditory cortex is somewhat delayed: reaching its peak along with the auditory belt and parabelt regions at month 6.4. Later still are those regions within the lateral and inferior temporal lobe and the temporal and frontal poles, not reaching their peak until 7 months.Figure 6.Growth trajectories from fitted splines for primary visual cortex and orbitofrontal area 13 to illustrate milestones of development. The shaded region shows the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the curve. The initial growth peak I) is the first maximum seen and the plateau end II) occurs when the 95% confidence interval for the rate of change no longer includes zero. The maximum rate of change following the growth peak defines stage III). These features can be seen most clearly in the first derivative curves, which display the rate of change of volume as a function of age. The first difference of note in the growth trajectories is the time at which each region reaches its greatest volume (milestone I); 4.98 months for V1 and 6 months for area 13. In V1, there is only a short period of approximately 1 month, before the onset of volume decline at 6 months (milestone II). In contrast, the peak volume of area 13 remains unchanged for approximately 6 months before starting to decline at 12 months. 3D reconstructions show the age at which these features occur for each cortical and subcortical region.An even greater difference is seen between cortical brain regions with respect to the age of onset of the decline in cortical volume (II). Much of the posterior sensory regions and primary motor and premotor (A6) regions begin declining between 6 and 8 months during puberty. In contrast, the majority of the prefrontal cortex, including orbitofrontal and perigenual cingulate cortex (area 32), and much of the anterior temporal lobes, start to decline much later, around 12–14 months, after puberty has finished. There are noticeable exceptions though. Cingulate association regions including subgenual area 25, dorsal anterior area 24 and posterior area 23 have an onset of volume decline much earlier (months 6–6.5), closer to that seen in posterior sensory cortices and motor cortex.The division between cortical brain regions in the age at which they display the maximum rate of decline in volume (III) varies considerably from the divisions seen in the age of the onset of decline (II). Consistent with the latter is the relatively early age, before or at the beginning of puberty (7.9–8.5 months), that parietal and occipital regions display their fastest rate of decline compared with that of prefronto-temporal areas at the end of puberty and sexual maturity (14–20.7 months). However, other brain regions that exhibited a relatively early age of onset of volume decline including primary and secondary somatosensory (S2) and premotor (area 6)/motor (area 4) regions (6.6–7.4 months) showed their fastest rate of decline much later (15.9–22 months) like that of prefronto-temporal areas. This was also the case for area 25 which showed one of the earliest onsets of decline at 6.0 months but one of the latest time-points for maximum decline (19.8 months), alongside area 32 (19.4 months), secondary somatosensory (22 months), and the ventral temporal lobes (20.8 months). This suggests that the period of volume decline is particularly prolonged in area 25.Many of the subcortical regions studied here (nucleus accumbens [Acb], putamen [Put], dorsolateral and ventromedical caudate [DLCaud/VMCaud], anterior hippocampus [antHIPP], lateral septum [Lseptum], and mediodorsal thalamus [MD Thal]) reach peak volume before puberty (5.8–6.9 months), similar to cortical regions. However, this is not the case for the anterior hypothalamus, basolateral and central amygdala, basal nucleus of the stria terminalis, habenula, dorsal and medial raphe nucleus that peak much later, between 10 and 16 months. Of those that peak early, only Acb, DLCaud, VLCaud, Lseptum, and MD Thal also show an early onset of decline (6.5–8.0 months). The rest, along with those subcortical regions that peaked much later, showed an onset of decline between 13.4 and 21 months. Of note was the marked difference in the onset of decline between striatal regions, with Acb, DLCaud and VLCaud declining at 6.5–7.8 months compared with the Put and Caud declining between 12.8 and 13.4 months. The age of maximum rate of decline for all subcortical structures is postpubertal (in general 15–17 months), but as late as 22–23 months, in early adulthood, for AmygCE and cerebellum.Clustering of Neocortical RegionsClustering provided a more data-driven technique to identify k > 2 families of cortical areas that shared a distinctive developmental profile. This provided an alternative approach to describing the data. The clustering was based on the whole trajectory in order to reveal those cortical regions with overall similar profiles. In addition, we assessed how well the 3 milestones that we had calculated from each trajectory were representative of the whole. Moreover, comparison of pairs of milestones at the level of clusters emphasized distinctions between groups of cortical regions sharing distinct developmental features.We focused on k = 6 as the solution representing the largest number of developmental families that were significantly distinct from each other (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 7 illustrates the differences in the profiles of the average trajectories of each of the 6 clusters. When taking into account all 3 milestones (3D plot in Fig. 7B) it can be seen that the clusters represented by the 6 distinct colors do form relatively separate groupings and ultimately these 3 milestones do capture the key elements of the trajectories representing the 6 clusters shown in Figure 7C. By comparing pairs of milestones in relation to these clusters (2D plots in Fig. 7B) a bimodal split in the age of onset and maximum rate of decline can be clearly seen. For the visual and cingulate cluster (1), somatomotor cluster (2), and auditory–visual cluster (3) onset of decline occurs at, or before the onset of puberty, soon after the point of peak volume. In contrast, onset of decline occurs at a much later timepoint after the point of peak volume, post puberty, for the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventromedial prefrontal cluster (4), ventrolateral PFC, polar, operculum, and insula cluster (5) and the lateral and inferior temporal lobe cluster (6). In addition, in the 2 clusters (4 and 5) involving prefrontal cortex, there appear to be 2 phases to the decline, an early shallow volume decline followed by a later more pronounced volume decline (maximum rate of volume decline).Figure 7.Cortical clustering by trajectory. (A) shows 6 clusters found by k-means clustering. (B) The clusters are well-differentiated when considered in a 3D space formed by the milestone markers of Figure 6: the age of peak grey matter volume, the age at onset of grey matter volume decline, and the age at which the volume loss is a maximum. (C) the mean trajectory for each cluster is shown, with the shaded region indicating a 95% bootstrap confidence interval.Since there is no consensus for a definitive choice of k we also show the hierarchical relationship of k = 6 to those of k = 2 and k = 10 in Figure 8. Of particular note is that clusters from k = 7–10 involved further fractionation of the prefrontal cortex, which showed the greatest heterogeneity of growth curves compared with all other association regions.Figure 8.Alluvial plot showing how clusters evolve from k = 2 to k = 6 and k = 10. At k = 2, the cortex is subdivided into one large predominantly prefronto-temporal family of areas (cluster 1: areas which have relatively delayed onset of peak growth, a more prolonged plateau period before the onset of volume decline, and a later age at maximum volume loss), and one large predominantly occipito-sensorimotor-parietal family of areas (cluster 2). Greatest heterogeneity in terms of distribution across clusters is seen among the prefrontal cortical structures (marked with *). Coloring depicts the k = 6 cluster solution. Pale blue (6): lateral and inferior temporal lobe. Green (5): ventrolateral PFC, polar, operculum, and insula cortices. Purple (4): orbitofrontal, dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Yellow (3): auditory‐visual. Orange (2): somatomotor. Dark blue (1): visual and cingulate cortices: Note that the 2 prefrontal clusters (green, 5 and purple, 4) split into 3 additional clusters between k = 6 and k = 10 such that at k = 10 prefrontal/cingulate regions contribute to clusters 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.DiscussionDetailed analysis of growth trajectories across 69 cortical and subcortical regions in marmosets from 3 to 27 months, using an accelerated longitudinal design, revealed 3 major features of grey matter development. These milestones of development were age at peak volume, onset of volume decline, and maximum rate of volume decline. Comparison of the resulting age maps showed that whilst cortical regions differed in the timing of peak volume by just 3 months (months 5–7), the period in which the volume began to decline was much more protracted, ranging from 6 to 14 months, with the maximum rate of decline occurring between 10 and 20 months. These feature-specific age maps revealed unique differences in trajectories within and between cortical and subcortical regions that varied between features. The prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of all the association regions with multiple areas displaying distinct milestones and developmental trajectories.Developmental Neuroimaging of Primate BrainsTo date, developmental neuroimaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates have revealed a number of key features of cortical development. There is considerable cerebral growth from infancy to adolescence, being greatest in humans and chimpanzees (both ~30%), but considerably lower in macaques (11%) (Sakai et al. 2013) and marmosets, as seen here (7%). Although GM increases before puberty are not consistently reported in humans (Walhovd et al. 2017), there is broad agreement that GM declines during development, whereas WM increases throughout infancy and puberty and post pubertal adolescence. This has been shown in humans (Giedd et al. 1996; Gogtay et al. 2004; Shaw et al. 2008) and more recently marmosets (Seki et al. 2017); and, in both species, differences in the timing of peak GM volume and rate of decline distinguish cortical brain regions. This overall pattern is also seen in the present study. In contrast, the decline in GM has not been seen so clearly in studies of the macaque monkey. In the 2 studies that followed development across a long enough developmental time period, one study (Scott et al. 2016) did not distinguish between grey and white matter and so the continuing rise in volume that they reported most likely reflects the continuing rise in white matter that has been reported in other studies. In the other study (Knickmeyer et al. 2010) only a rise and subsequent decline was seen in the prefrontal region. All other cortical regions showed either a continuing rise or no change. As that study was purely cross-sectional, it is likely that individual variability masked details of the developmental trajectory exposed in a longitudinal design. Individual variability can be substantial (compare panels A and B of Fig. 2 to see the effect of allowing for individual variability in elucidating growth trajectories).In studies of macaques and previous studies of marmosets there was relatively gross parcellation of the cortex, primarily at the level of cortical lobes (e.g., parietal, occipital). In contrast, in humans, when a more detailed analysis is performed at the level of specific cortical regions, substantially different developmental trajectories have been identified that differentiate isocortex (complex cubic trajectory) from older allocortex (linear or quadratic trajectories) (Shaw et al. 2008).Growth Modeling and MilestonesThe current results provide important new insight by characterizing 2 additional features of the developmental growth trajectories that, combined with an even finer-grained analysis at the level of individual cytoarchitectonic divisions, have revealed a more complex array of developmental time windows. Hence, they provide greater differentiation of primate cortical growth patterns than hitherto described. Importantly, they not only replicate previous findings that the frontal and temporal cortices develop later than all other cortical regions but they reveal that the variability in the timing of development within prefrontal cortex is the most heterogeneous of all cortical regions.The first of these features is the plateau length. The second is the age at which the maximum rate of decline occurs. Previous modeling of cortical growth curves has not had sufficient degrees of freedom to capture these additional features. Together with maximum volume, these 3 developmental milestones reflected in the growth trajectories of the GM most likely represent distinct ages at which numerous different physiological/cellular processes are occurring. The increase and decline (inverted “U” shape) in structural volume measurements is a direct consequence of not only brain shape and localized volume changes, but changes of the MRI signal itself. This can occur because of changes in the fraction of watery “cytoplasmic material,” like cell bodies, synapses or extracellular fluid. Thus, the early increases in GM volume reported here likely reflect the critical periods of experience dependent molding of cortical columnar architecture in monkeys including macaques and marmosets (Alexander and Goldman 1978; Missler et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 1995; Shaw et al. 2008; Geschwind and Rakic 2013; Takesian and Hensch 2013), which may close around the time of peak volume. The subsequent decline in GM volume may be the result of a period of pruning and the selective elimination of synapses (Anderson et al. 1995). However, an additional contributor to a decline in the MRI signal is an increase in the fraction of “fatty” myelinated material, like axons. Consequently, the apparent shrinkage of GM may also represent the expansion of myelinated axons into the cortical neuropil (Shaw et al. 2008; Whitaker et al. 2016). Each of the 3 milestones may therefore provide insight into differential cortical organization, pruning and myelination during development.Of the 3 milestones, the “age of peak volume” showed the smallest difference across all the cortical regions. The occipital pole was first, at approximately 5 months, and then the age increased incrementally from caudal to rostral, with the latest timing of peak volume occurring in the frontal pole and anterior temporal cortex and pole at 7.8 months. Thus, if this represents the period of experience dependent molding of cortical columnar architecture this appears to occur at a relatively similar time period across the cortex. The exceptions were in some subcortical regions including the hypothalamus, BNST, amygdala, habenula, caudate body, and raphe. Cortical regions displayed a much greater difference in the age of onset of GM decline, the age of the maximum rate of decline and the duration of that period of decline, periods likely associated with pruning and myelination. The “age of onset of the decline in volume” highlighted the late maturation (12–14 months) post puberty of the prefrontal and lateral and inferior temporal association cortices, compared with the rest of the cortex, in which onset of decline occurred at or before puberty. Of note, the association areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, including dorsal area 24 and subgenual area 25, showed a much earlier onset of decline, between 6 and 8 months, similar to primary and secondary sensory regions, suggesting that pruning and myelination processing may be engaged in these regions much earlier than neighboring prefrontal association cortex. However, the age of “maximum rate of decline,” suggestive of a period of maximal neuronal pruning/myelination, occurs very late in area 25 (19.8 m) in late adolescence, more similar in time to that of prefrontal association cortex. Indeed, this milestone is only later still in the ventral temporal lobe (20.8 m) and secondary somatosensory cortex (22 m), areas that are interconnected with area 25 (Joyce and Barbas 2018). Whilst only a small number of studies have investigated marmoset brain development in post mortem tissue and these have been limited to just a few specific cortical brain areas, there is re-assuring correspondence in the timings of periods of greatest circuitry rearrangement in those brain regions and the timing of MRI milestones described here. For example, the relatively flat MRI-derived growth trajectory of V1 after 9 months is consistent with the completion of the period of greatest circuitry rearrangement in V1 reported by (Fritschy and Garey 1986) and (Spatz et al. 1993). Also, the finding that middle temporal area and primary visual areas have similar growth trajectories and milestones is comparable to that revealed by neurofilament protein immunostaining; a marker of morphological maturation of neurons and stability of connections (Bourne and Rosa 2006). Finally, the same marker has been used to show later maturation of rostral regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with caudal regions (Burman et al. 2007), supported by the delayed age of onset of decline in grey matter of area 46 compared with area 8 described here (compare purple and orange trajectories in Fig. 7C).Additional insights into the general principles of cortical brain growth are provided by the cluster analysis of the overall developmental trajectories. Whilst we highlight the 6 cluster solution in particular, it is interesting to note that higher cluster solutions of 7–10 display a hierarchical reorganization (Fig. 8) and in all cases involve further fractionation of the prefrontal cortex involving the ventrolateral PFC (areas 45, 47) and the frontal pole (area 10) (from 6 to 7 clusters), areas 25 and 32 (from 7 to 8 clusters), area 10 (from 8 to 9 clusters), and finally areas 8 and 24 and area 13 (from 9 to 10 clusters). This indicates that not only does the prefrontal cortex, along with anterotemporal regions of association cortex, display the latest maturation but the prefrontal cortex also shows the greatest variability in developmental growth patterns. It should be noted that we do not suggest that k = 6 is an important biological conclusion of itself, but we have used the clustering solutions to demonstrate that our 3 chosen milestones usefully distinguish between families of trajectories chosen by a data-driven technique that does not rely on manual selection of features of interest.Pathophysiological InterpretationOf the differing cortical growth patterns identified in the current study a few deserve highlighting because of their particular novelty and relevance to symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders and susceptibility to stress during development. The rapid onset of decline in the cingulate cortex occurring at approximately the same time as that of the occipital lobe suggests that maturational processes start early throughout this region. However, unlike the occipital and dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, the maturational processes in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, primarily area 25, extend over the entire pubertal and postpubertal periods. This may indicate that the subgenual cingulate cortex is particularly vulnerable to external stressors for extended periods of development and may explain its prominent role in models of depression (Drevets et al. 2008; Johansen-Berg et al. 2008). Other areas showing an overall similar growth trajectory to subgenual area 25 include the more anterior ventromedial areas 14 and 32, medial orbital regions 11 and 13, areas 9 and 46 and secondary somatosensory association cortex, regions with which area 25 is directly connected (Joyce and Barbas 2018). In addition, this trajectory pattern best described those of the ventromedial caudate, accumbens, basolateral amygdala, mediodorsal thalamus, and medial raphe area, all regions with extensive connectivity with medial orbital and ventromedial regions of PFC and involved in the regulation of emotion (Price and Drevets 2012; Joyce and Barbas 2018).The other cluster within k = 6 clusters to involve prefrontal regions included frontal polar area 10, and ventrolateral PFC regions 45 and 47, alongside the full extent of the insula cortex and neighboring proisocortex in the temporal pole. The inclusion of the auditory parabelt region is consistent with the known connections of this region with vocalization processing within ventrolateral PFC regions in macaques (Plakke and Romanski 2014). Moreover, vocalizations induced by periaqueductal grey stimulation activate the vlPFC region in other new world monkeys, for example, tamarinds (Jurgens et al. 1996). These findings concur with those of (Raznahan et al. 2011), which, by studying the default mode and task positive networks in humans, provided evidence for close associations between functional and maturational coupling.Together the findings presented here, in particular the heterogeneity of developmental trajectories within the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, provides important new insight into the distinct stages of development at which these different prefrontal/cingulate circuits, and hence different cognitive and emotional functions, may be at their most vulnerable to stress-related psychological, physiological and immunological impact. This will guide future developmental stress models of psychiatric disorders, highlighting different windows of sensitivity for targeting stressful interventions. Such models have the potential to reveal distinct behavioral phenotypes arising from these different developmental epochs that may cause a specific spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, knowledge of the timing of milestones in distinct brain regions will guide not only future post mortem studies but also further imaging studies targeting these relevant developmental epochs to characterize the underlying cellular processes that these milestones represent.Considerations of Growth Curve Modeling Across StudiesIn recently published marmoset studies (Seki et al. 2017; Uematsu et al. 2017) the MRI is at a lower spatial resolution than the present study and importantly a biexponential model (i.e., V=Aeαt−Beβt, for the volume V of a brain region at age t) is fitted to the data after removing subject effects, in contrast to the cubic spline approach used here. The biexponential growth model can only support a single turning point (at age t=1β−αln(αA/βB)) with all brain structures showing rapid initial postnatal volume growth with relative stability in adulthood. The constraint of a single turning point restricts flexibility in the crucial stages between infancy and adolescence (which are also where many neuropsychiatric problems become apparent). Thus, this model is unable to capture the additional features that we have shown clearly differentiate growth patterns of primary and association areas of cortex. Other studies in the marmoset have a more limited scope, for example, focussing exclusively on corpus callosum measurements (Sakai et al. 2017) or gross cortical divisions (Seki et al. 2017).Similarly, the low-order polynomial models typically adopted in human studies (Shaw et al. 2008), such as linear, quadratic, and cubic curves, which allow 0, 1, or 2 turning points respectively, also do not allow as much flexibility to match features in growth curves as afforded by cubic splines. In addition, the parameters from such models can be highly variable depending on seemingly irrelevant factors such as the range in ages of the included subjects (Fjell et al. 2010) and by their nature have inappropriate limiting behavior for very young and very old subjects. Although polynomial models may serve as suitable interpolants over limited age ranges, they are incapable of accurately modeling more complicated features such as the rapid initial growth followed by a delayed onset of decline prior to the relative stability seen in adulthood that our data show.Study LimitationsTwo processes are responsible for GM volume reductions reported here. Proton density in myelinated tissue is approximately 10% lower and bound protons in myelin layers have a shortened T2, leading to lower signal intensity in the present MRI protocol (Tofts 2003). As the volume fraction of myelin increases, the signal becomes hypointense and such tissues are given a greater WM weighting and a lesser GM weighting in the segmentation process.Other processes can cause signal reductions that could increase the likelihood that voxels are labeled as WM, such as iron deposition or reduction in water content. A more sophisticated imaging protocol, for example multiparametric mapping (Helms et al. 2008; Weiskopf et al. 2013) or the incorporation of diffusion-tensor imaging measurements could more reliably capture WM. Nevertheless, the WM maps produced are consistent with the known anatomy and the complementary techniques of visual inspection, TBM, and ROI-based trajectory analysis give consistent results.ConclusionsWe present the first detailed survey of regional growth trajectories in a monkey brain from infancy to adulthood. Three milestones of development are identified that together describe the overall growth trajectories and highlight distinct clusters of cortical brain regions with markedly different trajectories. Not only does the prefrontal cortex show late adolescent maturational changes consistent with those already reported in humans and nonhuman primates but we show for the first time that the prefrontal cortex also has the greatest intraregional variability of growth patterns of relevance to the varied symptomatology of neuropsychiatric disorders which have their onset during development. In addition, consideration of the particular groupings of brain regions within clusters, reveal evidence for functional and maturational coupling.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary DataClick here for additional data file.NotesConflict of Interest: Yes.

We examined associations between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation, IQ, and subsequent schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (ONAP) to elucidate the role of neurodevelopment and inflammation in the pathogenesis of psychosis.MethodsPopulation-based data on ESR and IQ from 638 213 Swedish men assessed during military conscription between 1969 and 1983 were linked to National Hospital Discharge Register for hospitalisation with schizophrenia and ONAP. The associations of ESR with IQ (cross-sectional) and psychoses (longitudinal) were investigated using linear and Cox-regression. The co-relative analysis was used to examine effects of shared familial confounding. We examined mediation and moderation of effect between ESR and IQ on psychosis risk.ResultsBaseline IQ was associated with subsequent risk of schizophrenia (adjusted HR per 1-point increase in IQ = 0.961; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960–0.963) and ONAP (adjusted HR = 0.973; 95% CI 0.971–0.975). Higher ESR was associated with lower IQ in a dose-response fashion. High ESR was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia (adjusted HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.01–1.28) and decreased risk for ONAP (adjusted HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.74–0.96), although these effects were specific to one ESR band (7–10 mm/hr). Familial confounding explained ESR-IQ but not ESR-psychoses associations. IQ partly mediated the ESR-psychosis relationships.ConclusionsLower IQ is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and with an increased risk of schizophrenia and ONAP in adulthood. Low-grade inflammation may influence schizophrenia risk by affecting neurodevelopment. Future studies should explore the differential effects of inflammation on different types of psychosis.Key wordsCohort studyco-relative analysisESRimmunopsychiatryinflammationintelligenceIQnon-affective psychosespopulation-based studyschizophreniaIntroductionThe neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that abnormal neurodevelopment contributes to the pathogenesis of the illness (Murray & Lewis, 1987; Weinberger, 1987). This hypothesis is supported by population-based longitudinal studies showing an association of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (ONAP) with lower IQ during childhood/premorbid period (Jones et al.
1994; Crow et al.
1995; David et al.
1997; Davidson et al.
1999; Cannon et al.
2000, 2002; Zammit et al.
2004; Reichenberg et al.
2005; Kendler et al.
2015). These findings have been summarised in a meta-analysis, which shows that there is a linear association between premorbid IQ and risk of adult schizophrenia and related psychoses; for every one-point decrease in IQ risk for schizophrenia increases by 3.7% (Khandaker et al.
2011).Co-relative control analysis is a way to examine familial confounding. This approach compares effect sizes for a particular risk factor-disease association between the general population and groups of relatives with different levels of relatedness (i.e. full siblings, half-siblings, cousins). If the effect size decreases in groups of relatives, compared with general population, this indicates that the association may be explained by shared familial confounding. Using co-relative control analysis, Kendler and colleagues reported that lower cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and ONAP is unlikely to be explained by familial confounding. Furthermore, premorbid cognitive deficits in psychosis may be the result of unique environmental factors (Kendler et al.
2015, 2016a, b). These findings provide important insights into potential causal models of psychosis and warrant exploration of unique environmental factors that may contribute to lower cognitive functioning in psychosis.Emerging evidence indicates a role for low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders (Khandaker & Dantzer, 2015; Khandaker et al.
2015a, 2017a). Concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated during acute psychotic episodes, which tend to normalise after recovery but continue to be elevated in treatment-resistant patients (Potvin et al.
2008; Miller et al.
2011; Goldsmith et al.
2016). Elevated serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP in childhood/ adolescence are associated with increased risks of psychotic symptoms or diagnosis of schizophrenia subsequently in adulthood (Khandaker et al.
2014; Metcalf et al.
2017), which indicates that reverse causality is an unlikely explanation for the observed association between low-grade inflammation and psychosis. A functional genetic variant in the IL-6R gene known to dampen down inflammation (Ferreira et al.
2013) is protective for psychosis and/or severe depression (Khandaker et al.
2017b) and physical illness commonly comorbid with psychosis such as coronary heart disease (IL6R Genetics Consortium & Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, 2012) as shown using Mendelian randomisation. This suggests that the inflammation–psychosis relationship is unlikely to be explained by confounding fully.Despite a great deal of cross-sectional case-control studies linking low-grade inflammation with psychosis (Goldsmith et al.
2016), population-based longitudinal studies are relatively rare (Gardner et al.
2013; Wium-Andersen et al.
2013; Khandaker et al.
2014; Metcalf et al.
2017). To our knowledge, no longitudinal study has examined the association between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation and particularly acute phase reaction (Harrison, 2015), and subsequent risk of schizophrenia and related psychosis.Low-grade inflammation can influence cognitive function across the life-course in the healthy population and in people with schizophrenia. We have reported that elevated CRP is associated with lower IQ in childhood in the ALSPAC birth cohort (MacKinnon et al.
2017). We have also reported that there is an inverse relationship between ESR and IQ based on a sample of healthy Swedish adolescents/young-adults (Karlsson et al.
2010). Similarly, higher levels of CRP are associated with a lower cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia (Dickerson et al.
2007). It is plausible that low-grade inflammation influences psychosis risk by affecting neurodevelopment. However, studies examining whether IQ mediates and/or moderates the association between ESR and subsequent psychotic disorders or whether they are independent risk factors are scarce.The present study aimed to examine the relationship between inflammation (indexed by ESR), neurodevelopment (indexed by IQ), and subsequent risk of hospitalisation with non-affective psychoses in adulthood in a Swedish population-based sample of 638 213 male conscripts. First, we examine the relationships between lower cognitive functioning at 18–20 years and subsequent diagnosis of psychoses (Jones et al.
1994; Zammit et al.
2004; Khandaker et al.
2011; Kendler et al.
2015). Second, we examine the association between inflammation and IQ reported previously from our smaller population-based Swedish sample (Karlsson et al.
2010). Third, we test the relationship between inflammation and subsequent diagnosis of psychotic illness. In addition, we examine whether the ESR-psychoses relationship and ESR-IQ association could be explained by shared familial factors using co-relative analysis. We examine mediation and moderation between ESR and IQ with regards to risk of psychoses.Materials and methodsStudy population and diagnosis of psychosisThe present study is based on Swedish men conscripted into military between 1969 and 1983. In Sweden, all men underwent obligatory military conscription between ages 18 and 20 years bar certain exceptions, so this representative sample included approximately 97% of the male population (Karlsson et al.
2010). The conscripts underwent various assessments over 2 days that tested their suitability for military service. The data provide a unique opportunity for epidemiological investigations; see Ahlborg et al. (1973). The conscription data were linked to the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register until end of 2011, resulting in an average follow-up period of 35 years (range: 21–42 years) after conscription (mean age at follow-up: 54 years; range: 45–68 years). The discharge register contains medical diagnoses defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD; World Health Organization, 2004). This allowed the identification of individuals first hospitalised with a discharge diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20; ICD-9 and ICD-8: 295) or ONAP (ICD-10: F21 = Schizotypal Disorder, F22 = Persistent Delusional Disorder, F23 = Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders, F24 = Induced Delusional Disorder, F25 = Schizoaffective Disorder, F28 = Other Non-organic Psychotic Disorders, F29 = Unspecified Non-organic Psychosis; corresponding diagnostic codes in ICD-9: 297, 298.2-9, 291.3, 291.5, 292.1; ICD-8: 297.0-9, 298.2-3, 298.9, 291.2-3). See online Supplementary Fig. 1 for sample selection process.Measurements of IQ and ESRIntelligence was measured during military conscription by tests on logic/general intelligence, verbal intelligence, visuospatial perception, and mechanical skills in solving mathematical or physical problems; see Karlsson et al. (2010). Results of these tests were aggregated on a nine-point scale that approximately corresponds to Wechsler adult IQ bands <74, 74–81, 82–89, 90–95, 96–104, 105–110, 111–118, 119–126, and >126. For visibility and comparison purposes, we rescaled IQ scores from this 9-point scale to a continuous score with mean = 100 (SD = 15).ESR was measured from venous blood samples taken at conscription. ESR is the rate of sedimentation of red blood cells measured over an hour and is a marker of inflammation, particularly a surrogate marker of acute phase reaction (Harrison, 2015). As with our previous Swedish study (Karlsson et al.
2010), ESR was corrected for the erythrocyte volume in the blood (i.e. haematocrit), according to the formula ESR × (haematocrit /45), and grouped into four bands, 0–3, 4–6, 7–10, and ⩾11 mm/h. The distribution of ESR was skewed (mean = 3.38; median = 2.18; IQR = 1.87–4.00), so this categorisation allowed better investigation of the effect of high ESR levels on IQ/psychosis. In addition, we carried out sensitivity analyses: (1) by grouping ESR into quartiles; (2) by grouping ESR into deciles; (3) using ESR as a continuous variable; and (4) after excluding participants with very high ESR that may be indicative of an infection; according to Mayo clinic, in men ESR>22 mm/h indicates acute infection.CovariatesMigration status (either/both parents born outside Sweden), winter birth (December–May), parental history of schizophrenia and/ or ONAP, household crowding, and maximum parental socioeconomic status at child's age of 8–12 years (worker, white collar professional, business owner, and unknown) were included as covariates.Statistical analysisFirst, to analyse the association of IQ and ESR with schizophrenia or ONAP, Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each one-point increase in IQ (and separately, for individuals in the higher ESR bands compared with ESR band 0–3 mm/h). Further analyses were carried out adjusting for potential confounders, and after excluding 622 participants hospitalised within 2 years of conscription to minimise reverse causality. Second, we performed co-relative analyses to determine whether HRs for the association between ESR and schizophrenia or ONAP changed as a function of family relatedness. To this end, we applied stratified Cox regression models on respective outcomes in the general population, cousin, half-sibling, and full-sibling pairs. For analyses of relative pairs, robust standard errors were calculated to adjust for family relatedness, that is, we included a cluster effect of each family pair. Furthermore, relative pairs falling into equal ESR bands were excluded to allow identifiability/convergence of the statistical model. We tested the proportionality assumption across all models. We also performed co-relative analyses of the ESR-IQ association. Due to the continuous outcome variable and cross-sectional association, we estimated linear mixed-effects models with outcome IQ and categorical ESR predictors as before (again excluding relative pairs with equal ESR). The models included a random intercept for relative pairs to stratify analyses. Third, we tested the association between ESR (predictor) and IQ (outcome) using linear regression before and after adjusting for potential confounders.Fourth, we tested whether IQ mediated or moderated the relationship between ESR and schizophrenia or ONAP. For these analyses, we used logistic and linear regression models. We tested mediation by calculating direct and indirect effects of ESR on psychoses. Mediation analysis of the ESR-psychoses relationship by IQ was not conducted for outcome schizophrenia as the unadjusted main analysis did not reach statistical significance, which is a prerequisite for testing mediation. However, mediation analysis for the outcome of ONAP was conducted using the subgroups of individuals with ESR of 0–3 mm/h or 7–10 mm/h, in which main analyses had shown an association between ESR and psychosis. We were also able to run mediation analyses of these ESR groups for both schizophrenia and ONAP when adjusting for covariates. Moderation was tested by including an interaction term (IQxESR) in logistic regression models of schizophrenia and ONAP.ResultsBaseline characteristicsOf the total sample of 638 213 Swedish men, at baseline 470 923 (73.79%) had an ESR level of 0–3 mm/h, 112 089 (17.56%) of 4–6 mm/h, 35 023 (5.49%) of 7–10 mm/h, and 20 178 (3.16%) of ⩾11 mm/h. ESR groups differed significantly in age at conscription, migration status, winter birth, parental socioeconomic status, and household crowding (all p < 0.05; Table 1). In total, 5398 (0.85%) and 5133 (0.80%) individuals in this population-based sample developed schizophrenia or ONAP until follow-up, respectively.

Evidence for these associations remained after excluding individuals hospitalised within 2 years after conscription (online Supplementary Table 1).Association between ESR and IQHigher ESR was associated with lower IQ at the time of conscription in a dose-response function (Table 2). When compared with ESR of 0–3 mm/h, there was a small but robust decrease in IQ for groups with higher ESR levels. After adjusting for potential confounders these associations attenuated, but remained significant. We explored whether the dose–response relationship observed using ESR as a categorical variable could be more parsimoniously explained using ESR as a continuous variable. Comparing these models using a log-likelihood test revealed no significant difference between two models (p = 0.62) suggesting that categorical classification of ESR is not superior to a linear description of the ESR-IQ association (online Supplementary Table 2).

Conversely, the risk for ONAP was significantly lower in the group with ESR of 7–10 mm/h, compared with 0–3 mm/h, both before and after adjusting for confounders. There were no significant differences between ESR bands of 4–6 mm/h and ⩾11 mm/h as compared with the reference group (0–3 mm/h). Exclusion of prodromal cases did not change the pattern of results.

The results offer some support that these specific ESR and psychoses relationships may not be fully confounded by shared familial factors.

The mean difference in IQ for higher ESR levels (compared with ESR 0–3 mm/h) were between 0.5 and 1.5 IQ points in the general population (ESR 4–6 mm/h = −0.48, 95% CI −0.58 to −0.38; ESR 7–10 mm/h = −0.95, 95% CI −1.12 to −0.79; ESR ⩾11 mm/h = −1.57, 95% CI −1.78 to −1.36). However, this difference markedly decreased in a gradual manner with increasing family relatedness (results for full-sibling pairs: ESR 4–6 mm/h = −0.02, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.14; ESR 7–10 mm/h = −0.21, 95% CI −0.44 to 0.03; ESR ⩾11 mm/h = −0.68, 95% CI −0.98 to −0.38.Mediation and moderation of the ESR and psychoses association by IQWe tested whether IQ mediated the association of ESR (7–10 mm/h) with schizophrenia and ONAP. For schizophrenia, the indirect effect (mediated by IQ) was significant in the adjusted model (β = 0.004, se < 0.001, p < 0.001). Similarly, for ONAP, the indirect effect was significant in both unadjusted (β = 0.003, se < 0.001, p < 0.001) and adjusted models (β = 0.003, se < 0.001, p < 0.001; see online Supplementary Table 5 and online Supplementary Fig. 2). However, there was no evidence for an interaction between ESR and IQ on regression models for schizophrenia or ONAP (online Supplementary Table 6).Sensitivity analyses of ESR and psychoses associationWe re-examined the ESR-psychosis association using ESR as a continuous variable, using ESR quartiles, and using ESR deciles before and after excluding participants with a suspected acute infection (ESR >22 mm/h). After adjusting for potential confounders and excluding both potentially prodromal cases of psychosis and those with suspected infection, there was trend level association indicating that each one-point increase in ESR increased the risk of schizophrenia (p = 0.070), but decreased the risk of ONAP (p = 0.053); see online Supplementary Table 7.Using ESR as quartiles, there was no association with schizophrenia (online Supplementary Table 8). However, those in the 3rd quartile of ESR had an increased risk of ONAP compared with 1st quartile; unadjusted HR 1.09 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.17); p = 0.029; evidence for this association attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders and exclusions (p = 0.074) (online Supplementary Table 9).After adjusting for potential confounders and exclusions, there was a trend level association indicating that those in the top decile of ESR, compared with bottom decile, had an increased risk of schizophrenia (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.27); p = 0.056 (online Supplementary Table 10), but decreased risk of ONAP (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.01); p = 0.074 (online Supplementary Table 11).DiscussionThe present study investigated potential roles of inflammation and neurodevelopment in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders in a large Swedish population-based male sample. We showed that lower IQ is robustly associated with subsequent diagnoses of schizophrenia and ONAP. We also observed a cross-sectional association between ESR and IQ that followed a linear pattern; co-relative control analyses showed this association was partly due to familial factors. There was some, albeit weak, evidence for an association between ESR and increased risk for schizophrenia. Contrary to our hypotheses, higher ESR was associated with decreased risk for ONAP. Co-relative control analyses suggested that respective associations between ESR and subsequent risk of psychosis might not be explained fully by shared familial factors. With regard to the interplay between inflammation and neurodevelopment, there was some evidence that IQ partly mediated the association between ESR and psychotic disorders. There was no evidence for interaction between ESR and IQ with regard to the risk of psychoses.The association between premorbid IQ and psychotic disorders has been studied extensively. Our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting lower premorbid IQ in future patients of schizophrenia and ONAP (Jones et al.
1994; Crow et al.
1995; David et al.
1997; Davidson et al.
1999; Cannon et al.
2000, 2002; Zammit et al.
2004; Reichenberg et al.
2005; Kendler et al.
2015). Adjusting for potential confounders and exclusion of suspected prodromal cases had minimal impact on this association. Previous studies indicate unique environmental factors may contribute to lower premorbid IQ in psychotic disorders (Kendler et al.
2015, 2016a). Our work indicates that low-grade inflammation may be one such factor.We have presented separate analyses for schizophrenia and ONAP to cover the entire spectrum of psychotic disorders. In young people, diagnosis can change over time, e.g. from other NAP to schizophrenia (Fusar-Poli et al.
2016). Longitudinal studies have reported that lower premorbid IQ (Kendler et al.
2016b), prenatal/ childhood infections (Brown et al.
2004; Dalman et al.
2008; Blomstrom et al.
2016) are associated with schizophrenia and ONAP suggesting impaired neurodevelopment and immune-related risk factors are relevant for all of these disorders.The results for an association between ESR and IQ are consistent with our previous Swedish population-based study based on a smaller sample of 49 321 participants (Karlsson et al.
2010). The findings indicate that low-grade systemic inflammation, as indexed by ESR, might affect cognitive development/functioning. However, the cross-sectional nature of the ESR-IQ association means that reverse causality cannot be excluded (Luciano et al.
2009). In future, longitudinal studies are required. Cognitive impairments associated with acute inflammatory conditions observed in experimental studies of humans and animals may be part of a ‘sickness response’, which is mediated by effector molecules such as cytokines (Reichenberg et al.
2001). Chronic low-grade inflammation, as indexed by elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers, has also been associated with cognitive impairments in elderly individuals (Gorelick, 2010) and with lower IQ in children (MacKinnon et al.
2017). In the elderly, such effects may involve vascular changes in the brain parenchyma induced by subtle but chronic elevations in inflammatory mediators associated with aging and other factors (Casserly & Topol, 2004). In children, however, potential mechanisms are less clear, and might involve effects of inflammatory cytokines on brain development and functioning (Spencer et al.
2005; Asp et al.
2009; McAfoose & Baune, 2009; Liu et al.
2014; Khandaker & Dantzer, 2015).Low-grade inflammation had an opposing effect on different types of psychotic disorders; higher ESR increased the risk of schizophrenia but decreased the risk of ONAP. A Previous study has shown that higher levels of IL-6 at age 9 are associated with increased risk for psychotic symptoms at 18 years (Khandaker et al.
2014). Other studies have reported an association between higher levels of CRP at baseline and subsequent risk for schizophrenia at follow-up (Wium-Andersen et al.
2013; Metcalf et al.
2017). These findings are consistent with our results that ESR levels in the upper normal range are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. Protective effect of high ESR for ONAP in our sample might be due to diverse diagnoses included in this group. In a Finnish longitudinal cohort study higher CRP in adolescence was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, but not ONAP, in adulthood (Metcalf et al.
2017). We previously reported an association between lower concentrations of acute phase proteins in neonatal blood spots and diagnosis of non-affective psychosis including schizophrenia in adulthood; but did not have power to examine schizophrenia and other psychosis separately (Gardner et al.
2013). Taken together, the current studies indicate that low-grade inflammation may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but its association with ONAP is less clear, indicating that further studies looking at specific types of psychoses are required.Results from co-relative control analyses further refine our results of the ESR-psychoses and ESR-IQ associations. The association between ESR and schizophrenia was comparable between individuals in the general population and between members of full-sibling pairs, suggesting that shared familial factors are unlikely to explain these associations fully. This suggests unique environmental exposures rather than genetic or shared environmental factors may be important. This is consistent with a Danish population-based study that reported that polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and a history of infections were independent risk-factors for schizophrenia (Benros et al.
2016). As the results for cousin and half-sibling pairs were not significant, this analysis requires replication in a different, possibly even larger sample. The ESR-IQ association, however, clearly highlighted familial influence on this association. Population-based studies do suggest that susceptibility to infection may have a genetic contribution (Cooke & Hill, 2001; Obel et al.
2010; Hwang et al.
2012), so the association of systemic inflammation and cognitive functioning might be largely based on genetic, but also shared environmental factors. Thus, our findings provide an interesting distinction: the association of low-grade inflammation with cognitive functioning might be due to shared familial factors, but its association with psychosis may be due to unique, environmental factors.The results of our mediation analysis indicate that inflammation may influence the risk of psychosis by affecting neurodevelopment. Thus, immune and neurodevelopmental mechanisms for pathogenesis of psychosis could be potentially intertwined. ESR increased the risk for both schizophrenia and ONAP (indirectly via IQ), yet also lowered risk (directly) for ONAP. Statistically, this phenomenon has been described as suppression (MacKinnon et al.
2000), in which both risk and protective factors operate together. Suppression hints towards the presence of different, opposing biological pathways, where only the sum of the direct and indirect effects of a risk factor reflects its final contribution towards causation of an illness.The results of this study need to be considered in light of its limitations. ESR is a marker of systemic inflammation and it represents activation of acute phase response due to various stimuli (e.g., infection, cancer). In future, studies of more sensitive and direct measures of innate immune activity, such as IL-6 or CRP, might be helpful. We carried out a number of sensitivity analyses to explore the ESR-psychosis relationships further. There was some evidence for an association between ESR and schizophrenia for participants in the top decile of ESR distribution but effects were not robust. The analyses presented here are based on male conscripts and might not be generalisable to women. However, previous studies did not indicate any notable sex difference for the association between inflammation and cognition (Khandaker et al.
2015b; Gale et al.
2016), or for the association between inflammation and psychoses (Khandaker et al.
2014). Strengths of this study include a large population-based sample with data from reliable general population registers, long follow-up period, and innovative co-relative analyses that allowed exploration of shared familial confounding.In conclusion, we report that lower IQ is associated with low-grade inflammation (cross-sectional), and with an increased risk of psychotic disorders (longitudinal) in adulthood. There is some evidence that inflammation may increase the risk of schizophrenia by affecting processes involved in cognitive development.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Dr Kenneth Kendler, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA, and Dr Henrik Ohlsson, Lund University, Sweden, for their advice on co-relative control analysis.The authors have no financial interests to disclose with regard to the content of this study.

There is an increasing interest in using concise computational tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations, and especially to track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However, the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain, a problem compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements. We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of Pavlovian influences and other ‘psychomarkers’ guiding decision-making would behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task, we expected this influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally, we hypothesized it would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian effects had weak temporal stability, while model-fit was more stable. In terms of external validity, Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience within the task, in line with normative expectations. However, Pavlovian effects were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus, although this computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development, it does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived Pavlovian measures for future studies.Author summaryChoice behaviour is guided by Pavlovian influences, so that particular features of a situation, e.g. if one seeks to gain rewards to avoid losses, privilege certain decisions over others–here, to be active versus vs. inactive respectively. Such privileging may be useful but may also impair optimal instrumental behaviour. We examined the balance of Pavlovian and instrumental guidance of choice in healthy, 14-24-year-old participants and found that young people with higher IQ relied less on Pavlovian guidance. Experience with a task changed Pavlovian guidance in a rational manner, so that it was used less when unnecessary. On the other hand, the degree of Pavlovian influence was not a highly stable trait and did not depend on age or mood. The degree of unpredictability in choice emerged as a crucial individual characteristic, associated with stronger Pavlovian influences yet more stable than them as a disposition.http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440Wellcome Trust098362/Z/12/ZDolanRaymond J.http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440Wellcome Trust095844/7/11/ZBullmoreEdward T.UCLH Biomedical Research Centrehttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-4751-0425MoutoussisMichaelRJD is supported by a Wellcome Investigator Award (ref 098362/Z/12/Z).

These parametrize process accounting for how the tasks are solved, and are identified according to the models that best fit behaviour. Individuals are characterized according to their coordinates in these dimensions and it is by this means that dysfunction is delineated. A number of such dimensions, quantifying features such as reward and punishment sensitivity [5,6], uncertainty [7,8], exploration [9], metacognition [10], interpersonal modelling [11] have been extensively investigated in laboratory tasks.However, to characterize individuals in a psychometrically competent manner, it does not suffice to have external validity in terms of indices of development and pathology. Temporal stability is also crucial [12,13].Stability and related psychometric properties are increasingly important as computational psychiatry moves from describing differences between selected groups of individuals, for example well vs. ill groups, to describing individual change attributable to development, vulnerability to psychopathology, and recovery from psychiatric disorder. Stability is also crucial if computational parameters are to guide diagnosis and personalized psychiatry. Unstable measures may have predictive value [14,15], especially if their variability can be understood [16], but cannot easily characterise individual trajectories. It is unclear whether computational tasks that have been well validated in the laboratory, and which are starting to be used in epidemiological samples studies [17,18], have psychometric properties sufficient to pinpoint individual dispositions. In particular, while learning tasks are amongst the most popular in computational psychiatry, it is not clear if they bear repetition, for instance whether the identity of the best fitting process model remains the same when they are applied again. Furthermore, we often do not know if parameters inferred by using these best models are psychometrically reliable, covarying with traits, or change with the individual’s state and experience.Here, we study the population distribution and psychometrics of a paradigmatic computational measure, namely the extent to which an individual’s decision-making is guided by Pavlovian influences [19]. This is the direct predisposition to prefer particular actions in response to features of a stimulus, such as the appetitive or aversive consequences that it predicts. This predisposition can help or hinder instrumental behaviour, which is defined in terms of the contingency between action and outcome. Pavlovian biases have often been studied because of their translational relevance for anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other disorders [20–23]. The incidence of psychiatric symptoms where Pavlovian influences have been implicated rises in adolescence. For example, we recently described a peak in mood symptoms in a large non-clinical sample around the age of 16 in females [13]. It is thus important to examine how Pavlovian influences vary with age as well as characteristics such as mood, sex and IQ [1]. This in turn makes psychometric questions related to tasks assessing Pavlovian phenomena particularly pressing.Pavlovian influences elicited by predictions of reward and punishment have been extensively studied through variants of a Go-NoGo task [19,24–26]. Here, subjects prefer to execute, rather than withhold, actions in proportion to their expectations of winning money. This Pavlovian ‘bias’ is quantified as a perturbation of a standard reinforcement learning model, using a form of bonus that is proportional to the predicted value associated with the stimuli concerned [25]. This rewards ‘Go’ actions in the face of ‘potential win’ stimuli and ‘No-Go’ actions in the face of ‘potential loss’ stimuli.To assess Pavlovian bias and associated decision-making characteristics, we used an orthogonalised Go-NoGo task, wherein optimal decisions (Go vs. NoGo) are independent of the goal outcome (winning vs. avoiding loss). This has been extensively validated to assess Pavlovian bias, while much is known about neural function in this task [19,24,25,27]. We administered it on two occasions (termed ‘baseline’ and ‘long follow-up’) in a large, naturalistic, epidemiologically informed sample of 14 to 24 year olds [28]. We first validated the class of reinforcement-learning models developed in the laboratory in this population. In the process, we asked which model best described behaviour and ascertained that estimates of Pavlovian bias were robust with respect to secondary modelling details. We considered a model with differential sensitivity to wins and losses, which Guitart-Masip et al, 2014, found to fit behaviour best (‘valenced-sensitivity’ model). We also considered variants, particularly equal sensitivity to wins and losses, but differential learning to these outcomes (‘valenced-learning model’). We then compared the psychometric properties of the best models using real but also simulated data. We examined the external validity of the best models by assessing correlations between parameter values and the variables of age, IQ and mood. Calendar age is a key variable in development, albeit not the same as developmental time [29–31]. IQ is also an important yardstick, as theoretical [32] and experimental [33] findings motivate further examination of its relationship with Pavlovian tendencies. Specifically, we argued that in the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task used here, efficient instrumental learning rather than reliance on non-instrumental Pavlovian biases is most profitable. Therefore, participants with higher IQ might be expected to rely less on Pavlovian guidance. Finally, we used the ‘Mood and Feelings Questionnaire’, or MFQ for external validation. This was motivated by two considerations: first, research has suggested links between Pavlovian bias and so-called internalizing disorders [20,21,26]. Second, we have found that MFQ is a good simple proxy for the ‘general psychopathology factor’ (see S1 Fig and [13]). It may thus shed light into how Pavlovian bias contributes to psychiatric vulnerability or resilience in general, although further research should address associations with other, specific dimensions of psychopathology.We examined longitudinal changes and correlations, particularly concerning the best fitting model and the trajectory of Pavlovian parameters. First, we performed a ‘short follow-up’ study over an interval of 6 months. This is short in developmental but not in test-retest terms. It helped us to subsequently interpret the results of our main, ‘long follow-up’ study, about 18 months post-baseline. Over and above model parameters, model-fit was of over-arching importance, as it assessed how well a specific cognitive model captures individual behaviour. We then explored the dependence of model-fit on age, task repetition and IQ.We tested three hypotheses for the trajectory of the Pavlovian parameter. One is that the bias characterising an individual was a trait that remained stable over the time of our study. Alternatively, it might reflect a slowly changing developmental disposition, specifically one where younger participants were more strongly guided by Pavlovian biases. A third possibility is that Pavlovian biases reflected prior beliefs not only dependent on the context of ‘opportunity’ (appetitive trials) or ‘threat’ (aversive trials), but also dependent on other features of the context, such as ‘task taking place in a particular laboratory’. In the latter case, participants could update their prior beliefs about a link between appetitiveness and the appropriate action across test sessions.ResultsKey descriptive characteristics of participants at baseline are shown in Table 1.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.t001Table 1Age, sex, ethnicity, mood and WASI total IQ distributions.Age at baselineAge at short follow-upAge at long follow-upMood at baseline (MFQ)IQ (WASI) at baselineSexEthnicity (UK convention)Mean: 18.95Mean: 19.38Mean: 20.29Mean: 18.39Mean: 110.4Female: 426Asian: 70Quartile 1: 16.45Quartile 1: 17.39Quartile 1: 17.69Quartile 1: 8.00Quartile 1: 103.0Male: 392Black: 34Quartile 3: 21.23Quartile 3: 21.30Quartile 3: 22.51Quartile 3: 24.00Quartile 3: 118.0Mixed: 54Range: 14.10–24.00Range: 14.93–24.91Range: 15.11–26.49Other: 18White: 591Undisclosed: 51Short time interval follow-up studyWe tested 61 participants at baseline, and then after an interval of 6 months (Fig 1), using the task briefly described above (and fully in Methods; very similar to [26]). We thus first explored temporal individual stability and group-level change over a time scale which was short in developmental terms. We report uncorrected Pearson r for approximately Gaussian quantities and Spearman ρ for non-Gaussian ones, using parameters inferred from the preferred model variant that emerged from model-comparisons. This was the ‘valenced learning’ variant, quite similar but not identical to the established one [19,24]. Please see the Methods section for details.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g001Fig 1Study task and longitudinal structure.A. Go-NoGo task. Modified with permission from (26). Participants are presented with four stimuli for 36 trials each in fully randomized order. After a short ‘wait’ interval, they implement a decision of either to press or not press a button. Subjects discover by trial and error the two possible outcomes for choice of each stimulus (win/nothing or nothing/loss) and across trials learn which decision, ‘Go’ or ‘NoGo’, most often (with probability 0.8) leads to the best outcome. B. Longitudinal study structure, summarizing and illustrating the stages described in Methods.For the overall propensity to choose action over inaction, parametrized by the ‘Go Bias’, baseline estimates were significantly correlated with short follow-up estimates, as hypothesized (r = 0.30, p = 0.018; Fig 2). However, this was not true for the other parameters. The Pavlovian bias, parametrizing the propensity to action in the context of opportunity and inaction in a context of loss, had p = 0.54. The motivational exchange rate, which measures how strongly likelihood of a choice depends on its value, had p = 0.55. For the learning rates for the appetitive and aversive contexts, p was 0.13, and 0.52 respectively. The irreducible noise parameter, quantifying decision variability that could not be reduced by learning motivating actions, had r = 0.24, p = 0.052. The extent to which the model accounted for behaviour, the integrated likelihood measure, was the most inter-correlated variable between baseline and short follow-up, r = 0.43, p = 0.00047. As we shall see below, similar results obtained in the larger, long follow-up study, suggesting that developmentally, individuals largely maintain their rank within the cohort with respect to this measure.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g002Fig 2Parameter time dependency for the short follow-up study, baseline vs. 6 months later.A. Go Bias B. (log) Pavlovian bias. Statistically significant correlation is observed for the Go-bias but not for the Pavlovian bias.Next, we tested whether each of the parameters increased or decreased with task repetition. As we had no a priori hypotheses, we applied a Bonferroni correction for 6 tests, so that a corrected threshold of p = 0.05 corresponded to uncorrected p = 0.0083. We found that outcome sensitivity clearly increased (uncorrected Wilcoxon p = 5.5e-7) over the 6-month interval. There was weak evidence that Pavlovian bias decreased (from a median on 0.20 to 0.12; uncorr. t-test p = 0.024).There was no significant change in the other parameters over the short follow-up, but there was good evidence that the median integrated likelihood increased (from -66.4 to -53.7, uncor. Wilc. p = 0.0038). 54 of the short-interval participants were also included in the long follow-up sample (Fig 1). They are included in the long follow-up analyses below, but their exclusion results in minimal change. For example, the baseline vs. long follow-up correlation ρ of Pavlovian bias does not change, while its p-value would drop slightly from 0.017 to 0.020.Key results from the short-follow up study thus were that model fit was longitudinally the most stable measure, while the group shifted its outcome sensitivity and Pavlovian bias in the direction of benefitting performance, and it improved its model-fit.Large naturalistic studyIn the large naturalistic study, we first collected data from N1 = 817 participants (‘baseline’ sample). Of these, N2 = 556 (68%) also provided valid data at a follow-up session, on average 18 months later (‘long follow up’ sample). We first analysed performance simply in terms of the proportion of correct responses that participants achieved in each task condition, time during the task and session (Fig 3).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g003Fig 3Raw performance in the all conditions.The middle two quartiles are in solid color, with the ‘avoid loss’ conditions in pink/purple and ‘win’ in gold/yellow. Just non-overlapping notches represent p = 0.05 for the uncorrected difference between two medians. One star denotes p <0.05 corrected for 8 comparisons; Five stars denote pcor < 1e-10. Long follow-up is shown next to baseline. A. Performance weighted towards early trials, the weighing decreasing linearly to 0 for the middle of the task. No-Go to win (NG2W) showed median success rate slightly below chance, in line with the literature. B. Late trials. Performance reaches maximum for at least a quarter of participants in both appetitive conditions, but a quarter (long follow-up) or more (baseline) participants still perform below chance in NG2W. Long follow-up shows better performance than baseline in all except the easy Go-to-Win (G2W) conditions.The characteristic ‘Pavlovian bias’ interaction pattern was seen, with Pavlovian-incongruent conditions showing worse performance than the corresponding congruent ones (Go to Win > NoGo to Win, NoGo to Avoid Loss > Go to Avoid Loss) at all stages. As shown in Fig 3A (‘early trials’ panel, second vs. third pair of boxes), G2AL showed a clearly better level starting level of performance than the other pavlovian-incongruent condition, NG2W (baseline difference: 18%, pcor < 1e-10; long follow-up difference: 16%, pcor < 1e-10). However, for the ‘late’ trials (Fig 3B) the improvement in median fraction of correct responses in G2AL was modest compared to those of NG2W. Hence, median performance in the latter now matched the former (baseline difference: -0.6%, pcor < 0.05; long follow-up difference: -0.6%, pcor = NS). This pattern suggests that not only Pavlovian congruency, but action and/or valence biases in learning and decision making need to be considered.As descriptive statistics do not distinguish clearly the roles of Pavlovian bias and other processes of interest, we fitted a range of computational models capable of these distinctions to the data. We used the integrated likelihood (iL) and Bayesian Information Criterion (iBIC) to quantify complexity-corrected accuracy (Fig 4) and thereby compare models [24]. We assessed whether the identity of the best-fitting model remained the same over testing sessions, and whether estimates of Pavlovian bias were robust to secondary modelling considerations. We expected correlations for each task parameter across time to be positive. Accordingly, we report uncorrected p’s for Spearman correlations and Wilcoxon paired t-tests. We were also interested in the direction of any systematic change. Here, in the absence of a priori hypotheses, we report Wilcoxon tests, applying a Bonferroni correction for as many comparisons as there were parameters.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g004Fig 4Comparison of fit quality for 6-parameter (left three) and 7-parameter (right three) models, using the baseline data.The ‘valenced learning’ (leftmost) model performs best, i.e. had the lowest integrated Bayesian Information Criterion score. Adding forgetting parameters (right three bars) worsened the fits due to the complexity penalties involved.In the baseline sample, the valenced-learning model performed best (Fig 4, leftmost), with the valenced-sensitivity model 255.7 BIC units behind. Importantly, these two models produced very similar estimates for the parameters of interest here (r = 0.88 between models for the Pavlovian parameters, r = 0.93 for Go-bias, p <<1e-05). A variant of the valenced-senstivity model, the ‘sensitivity ratio’ model, also furnished highly similar Pavlovian bias estimates (e.g. r = 0.93, p <<1e-05 with valenced-learning). As a quality check, the ‘irreducible noise’ parameters, which quantify lack of attention and motivation-independent lapses, were reassuringly low (5–7%). In the long follow-up sample the valenced-learning model again obtained an advantage, here of 275.6 BIC units over the second-best, valenced-sensitivity model.However, the mean advantage of the winning model per participant was only 0.15 BIC units at baseline, while the typical individual uncertainty in iBIC, estimated as the SD of BIC scores refitted to data generated using the exact mean population value of each parameter for the winning model, was 7.9 units. Thus, while evidence of >250 BIC units is considered overwhelming by conventional standards [34], we asked if in studies with N>500 it might arise by chance and, as importantly, what difference in predictive power it signifies. Using a paired Wilcoxon test to compare fits for the two models for the data obtained in the first (baseline) testing session gave p = 0.09, while for the long follow-up Wilcoxon p was 1.7e-4, overall providing evidence against a false positive finding. Similarly, using integrated likelihood estimates at the individual level yielded values of approximate protected exceedance probabilities of 0.569 for baseline and 0.974 for long follow-up in favour of valenced-learning [35]. However, when we asked if having a greater likelihood for the one model at baseline implied a similar ordering at long follow-up, a chi-square test showed no evidence (p = 0.38). Numerical studies later showed that even if individuals’ employment of a particular model [valenced learning or sensitivity] remained fixed, and so constituted a ‘type’, our relatively brief experiment would be under-powered to allocate individuals to their type reliably (see S1 Appendix, ‘In silico simulated agents’ reliability and biases’).We then estimated predictive power. First, we expressed the difference in BIC in terms of the probability of the model better predicting a participant’s decision per trial. Even at long follow-up, this difference was very small, mean ΔPpt = 0.0011, compared to a grand mean prediction probability per trial, Ppt = 0.64. We also introduced a new out-of-sample, or ‘left out likelihood’ (LOL) comparison method, suitable for tasks involving learning which present challenges for predictive tests. This is important, as predictive tests do not rely on the approximations inherent in the BIC and become more and more powerful as datasets become larger (interested readers are referred to the Methods section for validation and details). LOL testing confirmed in an unbiased manner that the likely difference in predictive power between the two best models was very small, interquartile range of ΔPpt -0.012 to 0.0026. Here the mean predictability per trial was 0.73 (see Fig 5 and Methods).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g005Fig 5Model comparison based on Mean Prediction probability per trial (Ppt) in the long follow-up sample, showing that the difference in Ppt between the two best models is similar if one uses model-fitting vs. out-of-sample based methods A. ΔPpt estimated through a model fit measure, namely mean integrated likelihood per trial, N2 = 556. Both models have mean Ppt about 0.64. B. ΔPpt estimated by out-of-sample prediction of the 48th and 96th trials for each participant on a test subsample of N = 255. This out-of-sample comparison is more variable, but the resampling-based 95% confidence interval (CI) of the median difference is -0.0012 to 0.0026, consistent with A. If it were desirable to further reduce this CI, the estimate could be averaged over rotated out-of-sample trials, at the very considerable computational cost of re-estimating the entire model fit for each left-out sample.To further assess model quality, we examined correlations between parameters within each of the best models. The ones remaining significant after correction for multiple comparisons for the valenced-learning model are shown in Table 2 (valenced-sensitivity is similar). Four within-model significant correlations were consistently found at baseline and long follow-up. The Pavlovian bias was anticorrelated with both learning rates, while the motivational exchange rate correlated with the Go-bias and anticorrelated with irreducible noise. The motivational exchange rate is also known as reward sensitivity or inverse decision temperature. It can be seen as the power that a unit of additional reward (or loss) has to shift behaviour off indifference between choices. The correlations were also significant in the long follow-up sample (Pav. bias vs. appetitive and aversive learning rates: ρ = -0.14, -0.19, p = 0.016, 0.00011; motiv. Exchange rate vs. irreducible noise and Go bias: ρ = -0.13,0.14, p = 0.043, 0.020). S2 Table shows similar results for the valenced sensitivity model.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.t002Table 2Spearman correlation coefficients between the peak posterior parameter estimates at the 0.05 level, corrected for 6*5/2 comparisons, for the baseline sample (N = 817).Correlation values below the diagonal, corrected p-values above.motiv.exch.rateappet.lrnaver.lrnpav.biasirr.noiseGo.biasmotiv.exch.rate-nsnsnsp = 0.015p = 0.0081appet.lrn-nsp< 1e-10nsnsaver.lrn-p = 8.3e-5nsnspav.biasr = -0.29r = -0.16-nsnsirr.noiser = -0.11-nsGo.biasr = 0.12-We then examined stability in the quality and nature of the performance, which is the main focus of the study. We started with descriptive measures. As suggested in Fig 3, while there was no overall change in G2W performance between baseline and follow-up (uncorr. Wilcoxon p = 0.31) the other three conditions did improve (G2AL by a median of 5.5%, p< 1e-5 corrected for 4 comparisons; NG2W by 2.8%, p = 5.4e-4; No-Go to avoid loss (NG2AL) by 2.8%, p = 1.78e-4). Next, we used these changes to compare an estimate of Pavlovian bias in follow-up vs. baseline. This estimate showed modest stability across time (Spearman ρ = 0.146, p = 5.4e-4; Fig 6A) but there was a significant reduction in its mean (p = 0.0019), largely attributable to a closing of the gap between G2W-NG2W (Fig 6B). Cross-sectionally, at baseline the first three conditions showed no significant linear or quadratic dependence on age (uncorr. regression p: G2W, 0.22; G2AL, 0.16; NG2W, 0.65). For NG2AL, the linear regression explained 1.0% of the variance, p = 0.021 corrected for 8 comparisons, with positive linear dependency on age. At long-follow-up, again the first three conditions showed no significant dependency at the uncorrected level (regression p: 0.98, 0.096, 0.73). However, at this time there was trend evidence for a positive linear and negative quadratic dependence of NG2AL performance with age (regression p = 0.093 corr. for 8 comparisons, adj. r2 = 0.012; S2 Fig).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g006Fig 6Stability in descriptive estimates of Pavlovian bias, assessed by the interaction between the fractions of total correct answers in the four conditions, ((G2W-NG2W)+(NG2AL-G2AL))/2.A. Stability assessed by baseline vs. long follow-up estimates. A positive correlation is detectable, rho~0.15, p = 5.4e-4. B. Difference in performance between the appetitive (two left) and aversive (two right) conditions. The horizontal lines show the median appetitive bias at baseline (G2W-NG2W; first violin plot; salmon) vs. long follow-up (second plot, in green). This significant difference (p = 0.0027) drives an overall reduction in the estimate of Pavlovian bias (p = 0.0019). The aversive context, NG2AL-G2AL, shows no significant change on its own (blue and mauve; p = 0.35). White boxes are interquartile ranges.To explore the evolution of the component cognitive processes, we examined the stability of the parameter values extracted from the fits of the winning computational model. To put the results that follow in perspective, the Pearson correlation for IQ between sessions was 0.77, pcor << 1e-05 while for the mood measure it was 0.61, pcor << 1e-05. A modest correlation across time points was detected for the Pavlovian bias (r = 0.10, p = 0.017; Fig 6A). A more salient result was an overall reduction in Pavlovian influences with session (from a median of 0.205 at baseline to 0.142 at long follow-up, pcor
< 1e-5). We found evidence that the short-follow-up participants changed their Pavlovian bias as much in the 6-month interval as the rest did in the mean-18-month interval. The scaled-information Bayes factor in favour of no difference was 4.01 (JZS scaled Bayes factor = 7.15, t = 0.76, p = 0.45). Decreases in Pavlovian bias between baseline and long follow-up were strongly correlated with improvements in performance in the Pavlovian-incongruent conditions, and anticorrelated with improvements in the Pavlovian-congruent conditions (S3 Table).We then performed a set of latent change score (LCS;S3 Appendix) analyses, useful for describing longitudinal change [36]. The most complex multivariate-normal model that can be fitted to the data, known as the ‘just-identifiable model’, showed a significant dependence of change on baseline (regr. beta = -0.878, p<1e-3), with higher-bias individuals at baseline reducing their bias more at long follow up (visible in Fig 5A). This model was superior to one assuming that change only represented regression-to-mean (χ2 = 7.63, df = 1, p = 0.0057) and also to one assuming the same mean and variance at long follow-up vs baseline (χ2 = 6.37, df = 2, p = 0.041). See S3 Appendix for illustration and more details.We found a substantial temporal correlation for the motivational exchange rate (ln(beta); r = 0.253, p = < 1e-5; Fig 7B) and especially for the model fit measure, the integrated likelihood, (r = 0.37, p < 1e-15; Fig 8A). The latter increased at long follow-up, from a median of -68.9 to -64.4, pcor = 0.023. There was evidence for a temporal correlation in learning rates, in both the appetitive and aversive domains (r = 0.09, p = 0.045 and r = 0.11, p = 0.011 respectively). Both increased significantly from baseline to long follow up (median differences of 0.028 and 0.027 respectively; both pcor< 1e-05). There was trend evidence of temporal correlation for the bias parameter favouring action over all trials (‘Go bias’: r = 0.082, p = 0.054) and the lapse rate parameter (r = 0.077, p = 0.068). Go-bias decreased (median 0.73 to 0.57, pcor = 0.014), but the most significant change was a decrease in lapse rate (median 0.069 to 0.055, pcor < 1e-05).10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g007Fig 7Parameter time dependency, long follow-up study, baseline vs. 18 months (mean) later.A. Pavlovian Bias. The most prominent feature was a reduction in the group mean. B. Motivational exchange rate (log beta). Here there is little shift in the modal tendency. Note that log-units are used and the contours are estimated by axis-aligned, bivariate normal kernel density estimation.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679.g008Fig 8The distribution of model fit over the population is bimodal and best described by four Gaussian components.A. Kernel density contours are shown, while the inset plots peaks of the landscape in 3D. B. 4-component mixture-of-Gaussians fitted to this joint distribution of integrated likelihoods, with participants clustered according to the Gaussian they are most likely to belong to. As can also be seen in the 3D rendering. Apart from the prominent peaks (cluster3, green, Nc3 = 176 participants, and 4, blue, Nc4 = 171) there are somewhat less prominent concentrations (1, black, Nc1 = 94 and 2, red, Nc2 = 113).For none of the parameters, or their change, did we find evidence of correlation with participant age at baseline (correcting for seven comparisons). We also examined whether the baseline parameters depended on gender, mood (the ‘Mood and Feelings Questionnaire’) or IQ (WASI total IQ). Correcting for multiple comparisons, we found no significant dependency of baseline parameters on gender or mood and consequently did not analyse for such dependencies further.IQ was significantly related to the parameters, decreasing with increasing Pavlovian bias at baseline (r = -0.13, pcor
= 0.007) as hypothesized. Other parameters also related significantly to IQ, notably motivational exchange rate (r = 0.27, pcor< 1e-10), appetitive learning rate (r = 0.11, pcor = 0.044) and aversive learning rate (r = 0.19, pcor < 1e-05). IQ strongly correlated with overall model fit (r = 0.28, pcor
< 1e-10). In the long follow-up sample the model fit (r = 0.31, pcor
< 1e-10), motivational exchange rate (r = 0.24, pcor
< 1e-05), and lapse rate (r = -0.14, pcor
= 0.014), but no other parameter, correlated with IQ. Regressing IQ on the (log) appetitive and aversive sensitivities of the valenced-sensitivity model obtained a multiple r-squared of 6.1%, whereas the single beta of the valenced-learning model absorbed 7.6% of the variance in IQ.We then examined the distributions of parameters and of model fit for evidence of sub-grouping. We used the baseline data for this screening, as it was epidemiologically most representative. There was no evidence for sub-grouping in the parameters, but there was for the fit measures, where a bimodal distribution was evident (Fig 8A). This motivated analysis of the joint distribution of baseline and long follow-up model-fit measures. This was best described by a mixture of two major, approximately equipopulous, Gaussian components and two somewhat less prominent ones (Fig 8B). This means that the behaviour of the high-likelihood clusters is much more predictable (less random) according to our models.We performed a mixed-effects analysis (here, controlling for re-test) to draw out differences between the clusters in terms of Mood, IQ and task parameters. As expected, we found differences between sub-groups in integrated likelihood (by construction) and motivational exchange rates and irreducible noise, which are closely related. More interesting, we found a consistent pattern across parameters and IQ, where the cluster which fit worse at both time points (blue or 4 in Fig 8) did significantly worse than most in all performance-sensitive measures, and had increased Pavlovian bias compared to clusters 2 and 3 (2 and 3 had the better fit at follow-up, Fig 8B). Pavlovian bias did not differ amongst the other clusters, while cluster 4 had greater IQ than the others. See ‘S2 Appendix: Clustering analyses’, for statistical details and illustration.Finally, we performed in silico analyses to determine whether the fitting procedure could reliably recover known parameters, and whether it might introduce spurious correlations between them (see S1 Appendix, ‘In silico simulated agents’ reliability and biases’ for details). Recoverability in silico was much better than stability in vivo, suggesting that the former is not a limiting factor in our study. Similarly, no spurious correlation was observed between the Pavlovian bias and learning rates, which means that the associations between them seen in the real data are likely to reflect a true feature of the study population rather than a modelling artefact.DiscussionWe report the first longitudinal assessment of the psychometric properties of a key computational parameter, namely the Pavlovian bias. We did this in a large, epidemiologically-based study of young people. The Go-NoGo task that we used yielded informative results in terms of the cognitive process likely to operate, the evolution over time of the parameters of that process, the construct validity of the model parameters in question and also useful methodological considerations.We found behaviour was well fit by two models, the winning one having two different learning rates for reward and loss but a single sensitivity to returns, and the other having a single learning rate, but two different sensitivities. This is consistent with, but also finesses, recent results stressing the dependence of learning rates on outcome valence, especially in young people [37,38]. We compared models not only on the basis of approximations to the statistical evidence for each, but also on their ability to predict left-out decisions. The dual-learning model fit better, but there was no evidence for a clear allocation of model type to individuals. Model-fit improved with practice and was greater for subjects with higher IQ. Estimates of the Pavlovian bias were robust to model type, but their test-retest stability was weak, limiting inferences about individual development. At the group level, Pavlovian bias decreased when participants were re-tested 1–2 years post-baseline.Pavlovian bias changed over test sessions, but not over age, in a characteristic pattern. In terms of hypotheses we set out to test, we interpret this as strong evidence against this parameter, as measured by this task, being a fixed stable trait. Second, we interpret a longer follow-up resulting in the same reduction in Pavlovian bias as the short one as modest evidence against this bias being a disposition slowly changing with development. The pattern is most strongly supportive of a hypothesis that Pavlovian bias approximates an experience-dependent prior expectation. Of course, our models do not directly compute the ‘probability that in an appetitive context, the correct decision is to act’, which would formally be a belief. However, an agent using such a belief would prefer Pavlovian-congruent actions, and a weakening of such a belief with experience would lead to weakening of this preference, so the evolution of Pavlovian parameters approximates beliefs or expectancies about contingency. The fact that model-fit was good and improved with time, yet parameters changed, argues against a fixed disposition. The virtual absence of cross-sectional age dependency of the parameters, and shifts being as pronounced after 6 months as after 1–2 years, argues against spontaneous slow development and for an effect of practice. Lack of strong age dependency of performance has been observed in other reinforcement learning tasks (e.g. [37] in adolescents vs. adults), but both performance and cognitive parameter age dependencies very much depend on the specific details of the task at hand [39,40]. Practice effects may have affected the improvement in the extent to which people were described by our models. Selective attrition may also have affected our data, though a follow-up rate of 68% is reassuring here. However, attrition may have rendered the long follow-up sample epidemiologically less representative than the baseline one.In this task, the Pavlovian bias aids performance in two conditions, and harms it in the other two. If one interprets the bias as a heuristic that is generally useful, the fact that it reduces with repeated testing is consistent with its approximating a prior belief which can be at least partially overwhelmed by evidence, rather than being rigidly hard-wired by genetics and the early-childhood environment. This may apply more generally to other cognitive biases, and may happen over multiple timescales. Our study only employed a limited number of follow-up occasions, making it difficult to discern longitudinal changes not due to practice effects. In this study, any age, gender or mood dependency of Pavlovian bias, if present, was too subtle to resolve.Psychometrically, the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task had the capacity to provide reliable estimates of Pavlovian bias, in that parameter recovery in silico was greater than 80%. At the same time, in human participants stability was reduced down to ~ 10–15%. The return sensitivity parameter was more stable. However, the stability of task measures was considerably lower than those for IQ and even mood, and lower than that conventionally required for tracing developmental trajectories [41].Model fit emerged as important, over and above individual parameters, being the most stable task measure. It classified participants into clusters with discernible longitudinal trajectories (Fig 8 and S2 Appendix). The most striking differences were observed between a cluster consisting of people who showed poor at both time points (4 in Fig 8B and S2 Appendix) and the rest. These participants were characterized by a higher Pavlovian bias and lower IQ than the rest, as well as by higher decision-noise parameters. Mood did not differ between any clusters. Poorly fitting participants may have followed a strategy less well captured by our models, or may have been irreducibly more stochastic. In either case, model-fitting causes decision-variability parameters to absorb this high variance, whether its cause is hidden cognitive variables that are as yet not represented in the models, or random noise. It would be interesting to use less constrained machine-learning models to estimate the upper limit on the amount of variance in the data that cognitive-mechanism models like ours hope to explain, and thus help interpret decision variability parameters [42]. Overall, model-fit emerged as a potentially important measure to classify developmental trajectories in future research.We found that IQ correlated with motivational exchange rates, and indeed model fit. That is, the behaviour of those with higher IQ was more affected by a unit improvement in objective outcome, over and above differences in learning and bias. This is what one would expect if IQ test scores were themselves dependent on how motivating the participants considered finding the correct answers in the IQ tests. This is in turn consistent with evidence that IQ test scores can be increased by material incentives and that motivation in the absence of additional incentives predicts real-life outcomes [43]. Likewise, confidence is linked to both IQ and motivation [44]. Our motivational exchange rates may thus reflect ability-dependent confidence, important for development during youth. Tasks involving simple inference about counter-intuitive contingencies, building on our Go-NoGo task, may be useful in exploring these relations. Furthermore, the neural process underpinning reductions in Pavlovian bias would be interesting to elucidate, as it has been suggested that top-down processes actively suppress this bias in more able participants [45]. Alternatively, reductions in Pavlovian bias occurring over time or across IQ groups in young people may relate to differences in fixed, for the duration of the experiment, Pavlovian parameters integral to associative-learning systems (bpav in Eq 3) like those of our models.Though not affecting our central hypotheses, model-comparison analyses raised important questions as to how young people learn differentially from loss and gain events. The fact that behaviour could be explained almost equally well either by recourse to valenced-learning or to valenced-sensitivity, merits further study. Learning rates and sensitivities can be distinguished [46], but the present task was not optimized to do so. A larger number of trials, for example, could help resolve this ambiguity. In terms of our models, subjects behaved either as if volatility were higher for loss compared to gain contexts (faster aversive learning), or were loss averse (higher aversive sensitivity). If appetitive and aversive sensitivities are valid concepts, they should be similar in comparable but learning-free settings, such as well-learnt versions of this task (improved from [26]). Based on the present results, we hypothesize that in a task capable of simultaneously resolving the valence-dependence of preference (valenced sensitivity) and of learning (valenced learning), the two sensitivities would be closer to each other than suggested by a pure valenced-sensitivity model, but would not be identical, as they would also be informed by loss aversion.We studied the orthogonalized Go-NoGo task because it is well established, widely used, specialized to assess Pavlovian bias, and could provide insights (especially about decision noise and model fit) likely to be relevant to other computational tasks. However, the findings reported here should be used with caution in other contexts. Further insights about Pavlovian bias may be provided by existing paradigms [47], but testing for the putative experience-independent core of this bias with a brief task, suitable for developmental research, could be facilitated by an adaptive design. We suggest maximizing the number of plateau-performance trials by adaptively looking for the true indifference point between the effective values of the actions (q, not Q, in Eq 3). An experience-independent Pavlovian bias would mean that in the appetitive domain, the reward for the ‘No-Go’ action has to be (adaptively) boosted by an amount proportional to the mean reward of ‘Go’ and ‘No-Go’ in order to achieve indifference between these two choices. Similarly, in an aversive context the value of ‘No-Go’ has to be adaptively penalized by an amount proportional to the average of the loss returns for the two choices to achieve indifference. For symmetric average returns, the mean of the (absolute) adaptive boost and adaptive penalty components would be proportional to the Pavlovian bias, and the difference between these adaptive amounts would be the ‘Go bias’.Methodologically, the present work extends the use of left-out-likelihood based model comparisons. These furnish outcomes that are directly intuitive and convenient for further statistical comparisons, as well as being free of approximations inherent in the BIC. On the other hand, they are much more computationally intensive and will require further refinement to render their use routine.In conclusion, we show that Pavlovian influences characterizing young people are well described at the epidemiological level by established reinforcement-learning models. Practice and higher IQ correlated with weaker Pavlovian influences, while higher IQ scores were also associated with higher motivation to attain a given reward, suggesting important neurodevelopmental relationships. However, neither the Pavlovian bias parameter nor other key task measures met conventional psychometric standards for temporal stability or for external validity with respect to age and psychiatric symptoms, attributes useful in characterizing individual variability and individual change. It is a matter for further research whether similar problems affect other computational tasks, but our study does give urgency to the work of establishing the psychometric properties of such tasks and the parameters associated with computational models them. Studies aiming to characterize individual trajectories of decision-making will benefit from psychometrically improved computational tasks, which better exclude experience-dependent components, as well as designs that include more follow-up points.MethodsThe Go-NoGo taskWe used an orthogonalized Go-NoGo task that contrasts a propensity to act, rather than not to do so, in context involving opportunity (‘win’) versus threat (‘avoid loss’). Participants were presented with four different abstract stimuli each of which had a constant, but unknown, association with a correct policy. The correct policy was either to emit (‘Go’) or to withhold (‘NoGo’) an action, here involving a button press. If the correct decision was made, the better of two outcomes was realised with probability 0.8. This better outcome was null (as opposed to a loss) for two stimuli and positive (as opposed to null) for the other two. The task closely followed a previously published paradigm [25], with some slight simplifications, unrelated to the core biases assessed by the task. These simplifications helped deliver it to a community sample, on a large scale and in the context of a multi-task battery. First, implementing the decision ‘Go’ was simpler, i.e. not dependent on any target features, unlike the original task in which the ‘Go’ action could be either ‘left’ or ‘right’ depending on the location of a target. This allowed trials to be shorter. However, time pressure from the remaining task battery (to be reported separately), meant that subjects performed a more restricted sample of 144 trials. Second, task clarity was improved by informing participants before performing the task that the outcome probabilities were 0.8 and 0.2. Third, motivation was made explicit by telling participants that they were playing for real money, that random performance would attract zero extra fee and excellent performance could be worth about five pounds sterling additional earnings. These changes were supported by piloting the whole battery in which the task was embedded, as we describe next.We took precautions to ensure that the fact that the task was delivered as part of a battery did not affect the power for testing the hypotheses in question. The battery of which this task was part of consisted of 7 tasks and took over 2.5 hours to complete, whereas the task analysed here took about 23 minutes to complete, longer than the average in the battery. We first examined data from previous, longer versions of the task and performed a pilot of 15 participants. In addition to quantitative data, these participants were de-briefed in detail by trained research assistants (RAs) who interviewed them as to whether they found the tasks tiring, interesting or difficult. Although quantitative data were in line with the literature, qualitative data suggested that some participants might, subjectively, be affected by tiredness but most importantly some found the task hard to work out and felt discouraged by this. Therefore, first, the randomization of the order of tasks in the battery was constrained, so that this task took place within the first hour of testing. Second, research assistants were assertive in enforcing short breaks between tasks and emphasizing the importance of attending to the task. Third, they reminded participants that they were playing for real money and that all decisions counted approximately equally, in monetary terms, encouraging attention to each decision rather than assume that shorter tasks paid as much as longer ones. Fourth, participants were reassured that they should not be discouraged if the best answers were not clear to them as the task progressed, but on the contrary they should proceed by trial and error and the best answers were then likely to gradually ‘sink in’. This is consistent with the Rescorla-Wagner model that we used to analyse the data. After the first 50 participants were tested under careful RA supervision, an interim analysis of the whole battery and more limited feedback from RAs was reviewed. This gave no cause for concern with respect to the present task and the quantitative parameters extracted were reassuringly compatible with those from historical laboratory samples (as well as the Results reported here).Participants were thoroughly informed about the task, including a veridical performance-related pay component.ParticipantsCommunity dwelling participants were recruited from within the volunteer database of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network Study [28].1. Large naturalistic study. This consisted of N1 = 817 participants who provided task data of adequate quality for analysis. They were spread evenly across gender-balanced, two-year age bins. Age bins were used to ensure evenly spread recruitment by age, but not for analyses, where age was treated as a continuous variable. All participants formed the ‘baseline’ sample. Of these, 33 were treated for major depressive disorder (‘depression cohort’) whereas 784 were not in contact with primary or secondary mental health services, and were invited to re-attend on average 18 months later (realized interval mean = 17.79 months, SD = 3.55 months; ‘non-clinical cohort’). This non-clinical cohort was approximately representative of the local population in this age range as it was (i) balanced for sex and evenly distributed through the age range, by construction (ii) avoided high concentrations of students and used, instead, a range of representative community settings for recruitment. The follow-up rate was 71%, N2 = 557 of which 542 provided good quality data.2. Short follow-up study. We tested 61 participants 6 months after baseline. These were also invited to participate in the ‘long follow-up’ (of 18 months), and 54 of them did so. There were equal numbers of participants in 5 x 2-year age bins, 14–16 years, 16–18 years etc. Each bin was balanced with respect to sex.Volunteers were invited to be approximately equally distributed by gender and age, between the ages of 14 and 24 years old, from Cambridgeshire (60% of sample) and North London (40%). We excluded those with moderate or severe learning disability or serious neurological illness. Recruitment continued until a total sample of 820 young people agreed to participate at baseline. The Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee approved the study (12/EE/0250). Participants gave informed consent themselves if they were at least 16 years of age, otherwise the participant was fully informed and agreed to the study, but their parent or legal guardian provided formal informed consent.ModellingWe explored variants of the core (here called valenced-sensitivity) model that [25] used to describe behaviour. First, the values of actions (‘Q values’) were calculated based on a learning rate λv. We use ‘v’ subscripts to indicate that, in different variants of the model, the parameter in question may be valenced, i.e. different for ‘win’ and ‘avoid-loss’ trials. In the valenced-sensitivity model all trial types shared the same learning rate but different motivational exchange rates ρv were used depending on trial valence:
Qt+1=Qt(at,st)+λv(ρvrt−Qt(at,st))(1)Only Q values pertaining to realized stimuli and actions were updated, with all others being carried forward from the previous trial. The model also kept track of the state values pertaining to each stimulus using the same parameters:
Vt+1=Vt(st)+λv(ρvrt−Vt(st))(2)Crucially, the conventional Q values were biased by two terms representing an overall tendency towards action (‘Go bias’) and a Pavlovian bias (towards action or inaction) that depended on valence (state value):
qt(at,st)=Qt(at,st)+bgo(at)+bpav(at)Vt(st)(3)
where the two bias coefficients b are zero unless at=Go. In effect this means that the No-Go action was taken as a comparator, and the Go action was either penalized (in aversive contexts) or boosted (in appetitive ones) proportional to the value of the respective stimulus. Finally, the policy probability for choosing an action was given by the softmax function, modulated by a lapse rate parameter ξ:
p(at|st)=(1−ξ)exp(q(at,st))∑k(exp(q(ak,st))+ξ2(4)Thus the motivational exchange rates ρv acted as an inverse temperature parameter for the softmax by scaling the outcome values in Eq 1, which then fed into Eq 4 via Eq 3.Several model variants were explored. First, separate learning rates were used depending on valence (‘valenced-learning model’) with a single outcome sensitivity.Second, an additional memory/forgetting parameter was introduced such that Q values pertaining to unexperienced state-action pairs decayed by a constant fraction per trial, rather than being carried forward intact (‘forgetting model’), quantified by an additional ‘memory’ or ‘forgetting’ parameter [48]. In these ‘forgetting models’ models, we argued that during long periods when, by chance, a particular stimulus was not observed, the associated actions might drift back to zero if participants brought to the task a (strictly unjustified, but common-sensical) assumption that values might be subject to non-zero volatility. The other models assumed that the value of stimuli not seen in a particular trial would not change.Third, the appetitive and aversive sensitivities of the valenced-sensitivity model were transformed into an overall sensitivity and an appetitive/aversive ratio (‘sensitivity ratio model’). This had two motivational exchange parameters, just like the valenced sensitivity model, but formulated them as an appetitive sensitivity and a sensitivity ratio. Therefore, at the level of the individual it was identical to the valenced sensitivity model. At the group level, the expectation-maximization fit used prior distributions for the parameters that were independent of each other. In the case of the valenced sensitivity model, this means that the distribution of appetitive sensitivity over the population was modelled as independent to the aversive one. For the sensitivity-ratio model, a positive mean for the population distribution of the eponymous parameter would encode a positive correlation between appetitive and aversive exchange rates. Model fits favoured the former model.Generative model fittingWe used hierarchical type-2-ML model-fitting, assuming that each wave of data could be described by a set of independent prior distributions for the mean and spread of each parameter. Waves of testing were fitted independently. Individuals’ parameters were optimized given point estimates of the mean and spread of the group they belonged to, which were themselves re-estimated. Specifically, we used the expectation-maximization algorithm in [25], modifying MATLAB [49] code provided by Dr. Quentin Huys. We estimated the ‘integrated likelihood’ and ‘integrated BIC’ measures used in that work (Eq 5), using the same sampling technique.
iLpt=ln∫p(dpt|θ,Μ)p(θ|Θ)dθiBIC=−2∑ptiLpt+Nparln(ntrnpt)(5)
Where iLpt is the integrated likelihood for participant pt, dpt the data provided by this participant, θ the ‘micro’ parameters of that participant according to model M, Θ the ‘macro’ parameters describing the population distribution of θ, Npar the length of Θ, ntr the length of d (same for each participant) and npt the number of participants.For the purposes of model-fitting each parameter was transformed according to theoretical assumptions and the group distribution approximated by a Gaussian in the transformed space. For example, following [25] we assumed that bpav>0 so this parameter was fitted in log space, whereas parameters having both an upper and lower bound were logistic-transformed. We tested whether the model-fitting procedure was robust to assumptions about the distribution of parameter values in the population (S1 Appendix). We tested two assumptions that were particularly relevant to Pavlovian bias. First, we allowed the population distribution of Pavlovian bias to be normal rather than log-normal. Using mean and variance population estimates derived from the real data, this translated to the presence of a small tail of negative values (S1 Appendix). Second, we tested whether model-fitting was sensitive to the precise form of the population distributions used, e.g. gamma rather than log-normal. Recovery of Pavlovian bias parameters was reassuringly robust in the face of such twists (S1 Appendix).Out-of-sample testingIn order to go beyond comparing models by using simple approximations like the BIC, we argued that better models should provide a higher likelihood for data on which they were not trained, compared to less good models. To do this, we fitted models as best as possible to everyone, leaving out certain test trials. Then we compared the sum-log-probability of the actual responses participants provided on these left-out trials, thus performing paired left-out-likelihood (LOL) comparisons. Confidence intervals around this difference of predictability-per-trial provide an intuitive measure of how much better one model is than another, especially when compared to the average predictability-per-participant-decision.For the LOL comparison to be optimal, models must be given the best possible chance to describe the individuals whose parameters are used to derive the LOLs. In order to do this, we first divided the sample into a 300-strong ‘group training’ set and a test set. The ‘group training set’ was used to provide the best possible descriptive statistics of the entire population in terms of the means and variances of each (transformed) parameter. These were the group-level parameters fitted by the type-2 maximum-likelihood procedure (S3 Fig).We then used these group-level parameters to provide priors for fitting the remaining ‘test set’, from which the ‘test trials’ were left out. Markov-chain monte-carlo (MCMC) fitting at the level of the individual participant was performed, using the sum-log-posterior over the included, non- left-out, trials only to derive posterior beliefs about parameters for each participant in the test sample. During fitting, MCMC efficiently provided sum-log-likelihood samples over the left-out-trials, thus forming the integrated LOL. Two trials were left-out, as described below. LOLs were not taken into account for parameter estimation, to avoid double-dipping. We repeated the procedure with different candidate models, thus obtaining (paired) model comparisons of their predictive power over the hidden trials only.For optimal performance, we first decided how many trials to leave out (left-out trials, LOTs). When a limited amount of data per participant is available, greater numbers of LOTs result in noisier parameter estimates for each model, making it more difficult to detect differences between models. Furthermore, it is not a priori known how model fit may deteriorate as a function of the number of LOTs for different models. Hence, it makes sense to use the minimum number of LOTs and rely on our high number of participants to power model comparisons. In order to assess whether these considerations were important in practice, we generated synthetic data using the valenced-sensitivity model, the best in the literature. Using synthetic data we compared LOL using the procedure above with the true LOL according to the generative parameters. S4 Fig shows how increasing the number of LOTs significantly degraded the power of the true generative model to explain LOT data.Next, we assessed the effect of learning on LOL estimation. Because learning occurs in every trial, learners follow different trajectories in the included trials depending on what happens in the left-out trials. Thus, even if the LOL is not used during model fitting, information from the LOTs may influence the fitted parameters, thus potentially biasing fitted parameters towards values most consistent with the participant’s choices (and hence high likelihood thereof) in the LOTs. Thankfully, we do not have to guard against every possible such influence, but only to make sure that using information from the LOTs (which stimuli where shown, which responses were performed and which returns were obtained) does not unduly bias the estimation of parameters based on the included trials towards values that make the LOTs appear more likely. In order to reassure ourselves about this, we performed a series of numerical experiments where we compared using the information above, to marginalizing over the above responses and rewards.Consider a model M with a single parameter ε. Assume, furthermore, that we have a flat prior p0(ε)~1 over this parameter. If h is the left-out, or hidden, decision data and v is the included, or visible to the model, data, taking into account the flat prior gives:
p(h|v,M)=∑εp(h,ε|v,M)=∑εp(h|ε,M)p(v|ε,M)∑ε'p(v|ε',M)(6)The question is how p(v|ε,M) ought to be calculated in order not to bias estimation of how good model M is, i.e. not to bias p(h|v,M). As learning takes place from trial to trial, should the 'gaps' in v be filled in with the veritable choices of the participant, or be marginalized over? To investigate this matter, we first performed a numerical experiment with a simple Rescorla-Wagner model with learning parameter ε, making binary choices between alternatives via a softmax function of known parameter τ = 0.1 (i.e. a bare-bones version of our models). We generated 10000 x 28 trial epochs, for three levels of ε = 0.05, 0.15 and 0.25. Returns were deterministic returns (action1 → 1, action2 → 5), starting values for each run: Q0(action1) = Q0(action2) = 0. The first 8 trials were hidden. We looked for bias by examining how our estimate of p(h|v,M) depended on whether p(v|ε,M) is estimated using ‘informed’ visible trials, p(i)(v|ε,M), or ‘agnostic’ ones (i.e., marginalizing over hidden trials), p(a)(v|ε,M). A typical example of how p(i)(v|ε,M) may differ from p(a)(v|ε,M) is shown in S5 Fig. Although they gave different results for each individual subject, there was no difference (and no bias) with respect to the estimates over the hidden trials for any level of ε examined. This is shown in S6A Fig. It is interesting to note that some simple measures were biased in the expected way; for example, the maximum-likelihood estimate of the learning rate based on the ‘informed’ method was closer to the maximum-likelihood estimate over the hidden trials compared to the equivalent ‘agnostic’ estimate. In the case of ε = 0.15 this was by 0.03 log units, Wilcoxon p < 1e-08.We then examined two further models, an η-greedy learner and an ‘observation-violating η-greedy’ learner. The latter was similar to the former, but, importantly, only updated action values for exploratory actions if they furnished a better-than-expected prediction error. We did not detect any bias in the simple η-greedy but we found a very small bias in the expected direction for the observation-violating model. The bias corresponded to 0.45% of the grand mean prediction probability. Given that this sequence of models was designed to showcase a difference between the more rigorous agnostic and the more practical informed approach, we concluded that any bias introduced by using the informed approach on our real data would be negligible.Longitudinal change modelsWe first compared longitudinal change with paired nonparametric tests. We also examined change using latent-change-score (LCS) models [36]. To do this we transformed the distributions of each (already transformed as above) parameter at each timepoint to normal as described below. LCS models formulate the change between baseline and follow-up as a latent variable, and estimate its mean, variance but also its possible dependence on baseline values. Pure regression towards the mean endows this change parameter with a value of -1. We used BIC and the likelihood ratio test to compare this model with nested, simpler models of change in the population distribution of parameters. Before we applied the latent-change-score formulation (S3 Appendix), we forced the marginal distributions of the transformed parameters into a Gaussian form. This further transformation-to-Gaussian to was achieved by first, estimating the mean and SD of the parameter distribution in question. Second, estimating an empirical (stepped) cumulative distribution function for this parameter with the R function edcf [50]. Third, applying an inverse-gaussian-cdf with the same mean and SD as the original. We then applied the just-identified univariate latent change score model.This formulation does not extract from the data more than the statistics we might otherwise estimate–i.e. the means, variances and covariance of the baseline and long follow up measures, if we assume a bivariate normal distribution. It is however convenient in order to focus on change and phrase different hypotheses in terms of model comparison (BIC, likelihood ratio etc.).Measures of general intelligence and symptomsWe used the ‘Mood and Feelings Questionnaire’ (MFQ) as measure of mood and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale—2 (RCMAS) as a measure of anxiety [28,51,52]. General intelligence was measured by the full-scale IQ of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence [53]. Measurements of IQ were performed on the same day as the task for the naturalistic longitudinal study. We used MFQ measurements taken near to the baseline testing session.Supporting informationS1 FigIn this sample, the ‘Mood and Feelings Questionnaire’ shares over 90% of the variance of the ‘general psychopathology factor’ (St. Claire et al, 2017).The relationship is monotonic and the linear part of the relationship already captures 83% of the variance, but here the minor but still highly significant quadratic and cubic components are included in green. We are thus justified to use MFQ itself as a simple and easier to interpret proxy for general propensity to experience psychiatric symptoms.(PDF)Click here for additional data file.S2 FigAge dependence of performance.Here, performance in ‘No-Go to avoid Loss’ is shown. There is an overall increase in performance with age.(PDF)Click here for additional data file.S3 FigSchematic of the algorithm used to ensure that the out-of-sample likelihood to be used for model comparison was tightly constrained but did not itself inform estimation of parameters used for its own derivation.Some steps are ‘good enough’ rather than fully optimal (but computationally very costly).

Association between inflammatory markers and specific symptoms may provide insights into potential mechanism of inflammation-related depression. Using longitudinal data, we have tested whether childhood serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with specific depressive symptoms in early adulthood.MethodsIn the ALSPAC birth cohort, serum IL-6 and CRP levels were assessed at age 9 years and 19 depressive symptoms were assessed at age 18 years. We used modified Poisson generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each depressive symptom. In addition, we used confirmatory factor analysis to create two continuous latent variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension scores. Structural equation modelling was used to test the associations between IL-6 and these dimension scores.ResultsBased on data from 2731 participants, IL-6 was associated with diurnal mood variation, concentration difficulties, fatigue and sleep disturbances. The adjusted RRs for these symptoms at age 18 years for participants in top, compared with bottom, third of IL-6 at age 9 years were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.13–2.69) for diurnal mood variation, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.11–2.02) for concentration difficulties, 1.31 (95% CI, 1.12–1.54) for fatigue, and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.01–1.52) for sleep disturbances. At dimension level, IL-6 was associated with both somatic/neurovegetative (β = 0.059, SE = 0.024, P = 0.013) and psychological (β = 0.056, SE = 0.023, P = 0.016) scores.ConclusionsInflammation is associated with specific symptoms of depression. Associations with so-called somatic/neurovegetative symptoms of depression such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and diurnal mood variation indicate that these symptoms could be useful treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials of anti-inflammatory treatment for depression.AbbreviationsALSPAC, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and ChildrenBMI, body mass indexCI, confidence intervalCIS-R, Clinical Interview Schedule-RevisedCRP, C-reactive proteinELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayICD-10, International Classification of Diseases 10th RevisionIL-6, interleukin 6RR, risk ratioSD, Standard DeviationSEM, structural equation modellingKeywordsDepressionPsychological SymptomsSomatic symptomsInflammationInterleukin 6C-reactive proteinCohort studyImmunopsychiatryALSPACNeurovegetative Symptoms1IntroductionAn association between low-grade inflammation and depression is well established. Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies confirm that serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6)] and acute phase proteins [e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP)] are elevated in acutely unwell patients with depression in comparison with controls (Dowlati et al., 2010, Goldsmith et al., 2016, Haapakoski et al., 2015, Howren et al., 2009). These elevated levels tend to normalise after recovery upon treatment with antidepressants, but continue to remain elevated in treatment resistant patients (Goldsmith et al., 2016, Maes et al., 1997, O'Brien et al., 2007). Longitudinal studies reporting an association between higher levels of IL-6 and CRP in childhood/adulthood and subsequent development (Gimeno et al., 2009, Khandaker et al., 2014) and persistence (Khandaker et al., 2017b, Zalli et al., 2016) of depressive symptoms indicate that inflammation could be a cause, rather than simply a consequence of the illness.Depression consists of a diverse range of symptoms. Inflammation may contribute to pathogenesis of specific components of the syndrome. Symptoms such as fatigue, psychomotor retardation, impaired sleep and change in appetite are often referred to as sickness behavior or neurovegetative symptoms in the experimental animal literature (Dantzer et al., 2008, Miller et al., 2009, Raison et al., 2006). The International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic criteria for depressive episode specifies these symptoms along with a few others as somatic symptoms of depression (see below) (WHO, 1992). Somatic symptoms are different from psychological symptoms (e.g., hopelessness and guilt) of depression phenomenologically (WHO, 1992) and perhaps physiologically (Jokela et al., 2016). Cross-sectional studies indicate that low-grade inflammation, as measured by elevated serum CRP levels, is associated with somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, impaired sleep and activity levels) but not with psychological symptoms within the general population or in depressed patients (Jokela et al., 2016, Kohler-Forsberg et al., 2017). However, these studies did not compare effect estimates for somatic and psychological dimensions directly. Atypical features of depression, particularly increased appetite or weight, are associated with a number of genetic risk variants for body mass index (BMI) and levels of CRP and leptin (Milaneschi et al., 2017). These findings support the idea that different depressive symptoms may have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Association between markers of inflammation and specific symptoms may provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms of inflammation-related depression. However, longitudinal studies of inflammatory markers and specific symptoms of depression are scarce.Using data from the general population-representative Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort, we previously reported a longitudinal association between serum IL-6 levels in childhood at age 9 years and risk of depression and psychosis subsequently in early adulthood at age 18 years (Khandaker et al., 2014). In order to gain further insight into the relationship between inflammation and depression, we present another longitudinal study based on the ALSPAC cohort that examines the relationships between IL-6 and CRP at age 9 years and 19 specific symptoms of depression assessed at age 18 years. In addition to using individual depressive symptoms, we created two latent variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological symptom dimension scores. We hypothesised that childhood inflammatory markers would be associated with specific depressive symptoms in early adulthood.2Methods2.1Description of cohort and sample selectionALSPAC is a general population-based birth cohort in the former Avon County in the South West region of England. 14,541 pregnant women who were residents of the study catchment areas and had expected delivery dates between April 1st, 1991 and December 31st, 1992 were initially recruited into the cohort, resulting in 14,062 live births. Additional children and parents were subsequently recruited into the cohort. Since age 7 years, the children attended annual clinical assessments during which they participated in various face-to-face interviews and physical tests. Detailed information about the ALSPAC cohort can be found on the study website (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac), and the sample characteristics and methodology have been previously described (Boyd et al., 2013, Fraser et al., 2013). For information on all available ALSPAC data, a fully searchable data dictionary is also available (http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary).The risk sets for the analyses presented here were comprised of 5074 and 5086 participants who provided enough blood during clinical assessments at age 9 years to measure serum IL-6 and CRP levels, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). 2731 participants with baseline IL-6 data had also attended the follow-up assessment for depressive symptoms at age 18 years; this analytic sample was used to assess associations between IL-6 and depressive symptoms. The analytic sample for CRP was similar (n = 2738). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.2.2Measurement of inflammatory markersBlood samples collected from non-fasting 9-year-old participants (mean age: 119.0 months; SD: 3.9 months) during clinical assessments were immediately centrifuged; serum samples were frozen at −80 °C in 1 mL aliquots. After a median storage period of 7.5 years, IL-6 and CRP levels were assayed in 2008. There was no evidence of freeze-thaw cycles during storage.Serum high sensitivity CRP levels were measured using an automated particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK). The minimum detection limit was 0.03 mg/L. CRP values in the entire sample (n = 5086) ranged from 0.01 to 67.44 mg/L; mean (SD) = 0.80 (2.72) mg/L. Serum IL-6 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D Systems, UK). The minimum detection limit was 0.007 pg/mL. IL-6 values in the entire sample (n = 5074) ranged from 0.007 to 20.051 pg/mL; mean (SD) = 1.28 (1.59) pg/mL. All inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation for IL-6 and CRP were <5%. No other inflammatory markers were measured from blood samples collected at age 9 years.Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were analysed as categorical variables. The distributions of serum CRP values (n = 5086) and serum IL-6 values (n = 5074) were divided into three categories (bottom, middle and top thirds) based on their respective distribution tertiles (66th and 33rd percentiles for CRP were 0.37 and 0.14 mg/L, respectively; 66th and 33rd percentiles for IL-6 were 1.12 and 0.59 pg/mL, respectively). Statistical cut-offs were chosen due to the lack of accepted cut-off values for IL-6 and CRP in defining low-grade inflammation in children. We carried out additional analysis using IL-6 quartiles. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were also analysed as standardised continuous variables (z-transformed values).2.3Psychiatric measures2.3.1Assessment of depressive symptoms at age 18 yearsIn assessment clinics held over the course of a few months, depressive symptoms were assessed in 18-year-old participants (mean age: 213.6 months; SD: 5.1 months) using a self-administered computerized version of the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). CIS-R is a standardised and validated tool commonly used to assess depression and anxiety in community-based samples (Lewis et al., 1992). As primary outcomes, we used all available specific depressive symptom level data gathered by CIS-R as individual variables. A total of 19 depressive symptoms were measured: fatigue, sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, irritability, depressed/low mood, suicidality, worry, phobia, anxiety, panic, psychomotor change, change in appetite/weight, diurnal variation in mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, low self-esteem, self-blame, decreased libido and physical symptoms. Because we were interested in clinically significant depressive symptoms, we re-coded all depressive symptom as binary variables based on a clinically meaningful cut-off. Please see Supplementary Methods for full information on the data re-coding. Supplementary Table 1 presents a complete breakdown of responses to each symptom category, as originally coded by CIS-R, and for the re-coded variables.2.3.2Somatic/neurovegetative and psychological symptoms of depressionSomatic syndrome is recognised as a part of the diagnosis of depressive episode (F32) according to the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research (ICD-10: DCR-10) (WHO, 1992). We selected the following seven symptoms as somatic/neurovegetative based on this criteria: anhedonia, diurnal variation in mood, psychomotor change, change in appetite/weight, fatigue, sleep disturbances and decreased libido. The following seven symptoms were classified as psychological: depressed/low mood, concentration difficulties, irritability, hopelessness, self-blame, low self-esteem and suicidality. Each symptom was considered as a separate outcome variable. In addition, we carried out confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to create two factor scores representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimensions using the seven respective individual symptoms listed above.2.4Assessment of covariatesWe included age, sex, father’s occupation, ethnicity, BMI and self-reported infections around blood collection as potential confounders. Because not every participant was exactly 18 years old at the time of outcome assessment, age was recorded at the time of outcome assessment in months and was used as a continuous variable. Sex was recorded at birth and treated as a binary variable. Father's occupation was recorded at birth according to the UK Office of National Statistics' socioeconomic classification system (Class I = professionals and higher managerial workers; II = intermediate occupations; IIIa = skilled non-manual occupations; IIIb = skilled manual occupations; IV = partly skilled occupations; V = unskilled occupations) (Statistics, 1980). This was re-coded as a binary variable with non-manual (I, II, and IIIa) and manual occupations (IIIb, IV, and V). Ethnicity was recorded at birth and originally coded as a categorical variable (White, Black Caribbean, Black African, Other Black, India, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and Other). Ethnicity was re-coded as a binary variable (British White and Non-white) because the study sample was predominantly made up of British White participants (97.4%). BMI was assessed at the time of blood collection and recorded as a continuous variable. Self-reported infection status at the time or week before blood collection was recorded during the clinical assessment at age 9 years and used as a binary variable (i.e. infection present or absent).2.5Statistical analysis2.5.1Comparison of baseline characteristicsSociodemographic and other characteristics were compared among groups with low, medium and high IL-6 at age 9 years. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for normally distributed continuous variables; Kruskal-Wallis test was used for non-normally distributed continuous variables; and Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables.2.5.2Association between inflammatory markers and specific symptoms of depressionWe used modified Poisson generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each depressive symptom at age 18 years for participants in the top and middle, compared with the bottom, thirds of the serum IL-6 distribution at age 9 years. The same approach was taken for CRP. All regression models were adjusted for age, sex, father's occupation, ethnicity, BMI and self-reported infection. Adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were plotted on forest plots. P-values for unadjusted RRs for IL-6 were corrected for multiple testing using the Holm–Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979). This method is similar to the Bonferroni, yet less stringent. Some have argued that this method is better than Bonferroni for public health research (Aickin and Gensler, 1996). For a step-by-step guide on how this correction is calculated, along with an example, please see: http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/courses/GeneSpring/GS_Mar2006/Multiple%20testing%20corrections.pdf.2.5.3Association between inflammatory markers and symptom dimension scoresFirst, we carried out CFA to test whether a unidimensional or two-factor model provided better fit for the symptom data (7 somatic/neurovegetative and 7 psychological symptoms) using the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimator. FIML allows for direct comparison of both models. The results showed that two-factor model was marginally better than one-factor model (unidimensional: AIC = 42376, BIC = 42556; two-factor: AIC = 42351, BIC = 42538). We then added IL-6 into the model to test the association between IL-6 and two continuous latent variables/factors that represented somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimensions. This was a structural equation model (SEM), which computed path coefficients, standard errors (SEs) and P-values for the association of IL-6 (standardised continuous variable) with these latent variables. The estimated coefficients are on the probit scale and represent changes in the symptom dimension standardised scores (Z-scores) per SD change in IL-6 levels. In addition, we used a T-test to examine whether coefficients for somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimensions were significantly different from each other.3Results3.1Baseline characteristics of sampleParticipants in the top third of IL-6 levels at baseline were more likely to be female, have higher BMI and have a self-reported infection around the time of blood collection at age 9 years. However, the distributions of age, British white ethnicity and father's non-manual occupations were similar across the thirds of IL-6 (Table 1).Table 1Baseline Characteristics of Participants by the Distribution of Serum IL-6 Values at Age 9 Years.CharacteristicDistribution of Serum IL-6 Levels at Age 9 YearsaP-valuebBottom ThirdMiddle ThirdTop ThirdTotal no. of participants167416751725Age (months) at outcome, mean (SD)c212.9 (4.6)213.2 (4.7)213.3 (4.9)0.11Male sex, no.

Fatigue (31.5%), hopelessness (31.1%) and change in appetite/weight (28.1%) were the most prevalent symptoms, while phobia (6.7%), decreased libido (4.5%) and panic (2.1%) were the least prevalent symptoms (Supplementary Table 1).3.3Association between inflammatory markers and specific symptoms of depressionIL-6 at age 9 years was associated with diurnal variation in mood, concentration difficulties, fatigue and sleep disturbances at age 18 years after adjusting for potential confounders (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 2). The adjusted RRs (95% CI) for diurnal variation in mood, concentration difficulties, fatigue and sleep disturbances were 1.75 (1.13–2.69), 1.50 (1.11–2.02), 1.31 (1.12–1.54), and 1.24 (1.01–1.52), respectively, for participants in the top, compared with the bottom, third of IL-6 at age 9. CRP was associated with fatigue, change in appetite/weight, and irritability in the unadjusted analysis; however, these associations became attenuated after controlling for potential confounders (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 3).Fig. 1Adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs for symptoms of depression at age 18 years for participants in the top, compared with bottom, third of serum IL-6 levels at age 9 yearsFootnote: The forest plot displays the adjusted RRs (95% CIs) for all 19 depressive symptoms at age 18 years when comparing participants in the top third with those in the bottom third of serum IL-6 levels at age 9 years. The RRs were adjusted for age at the time of outcome assessment, sex, ethnicity, father’s occupation, BMI at age 9 years and self-reported infection at age 9 years. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties and diurnal variation in mood remained associated with IL-6 after adjusting for confounding.Fig. 2Adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs for symptoms of depression at age 18 years for participants in the top, compared with bottom, third of serum CRP levels at age 9 yearsFootnote: The forest plot displays the adjusted RRs (95% CIs) for all 19 depressive symptoms at age 18 years when comparing participants in the top third with those in the bottom third of serum CRP levels at age 9 years. The RRs were adjusted for age at the time of outcome assessment, sex, ethnicity, father’s occupation, BMI at age 9 years and self-reported infection at age 9 years. CRP was not associated with depressive symptoms after adjusting for confounding.Sensitivity analyses using quartiles of IL-6 showed that IL-6 was associated with fatigue, diurnal variation in mood, concentration difficulties and hopelessness after controlling for potential confounders for participants in the top quartile of IL-6 distribution compared with those in the bottom quartile. There was also trend level association of IL-6 with anhedonia, psychomotor change and low self-esteem. Please see Supplementary Table 4.3.4Association between inflammatory markers and symptom dimension scoresSEM analysis testing the association between IL-6 and two latent variables representing depressive symptom dimensions showed that IL-6 was associated with both somatic/neurovegetative (co-efficient = 0.059, SE = 0.024, P = 0.013) and psychological dimensions (co-efficient = 0.056, SE = 0.023, P = 0.016); see Fig. 3. In other words, a SD change in IL-6 levels translated to a change in the Z-scores by 0.059 points for the somatic/neurovegetative dimension and 0.056 points for the psychological dimension. A t-test comparing the coefficients did not show a statistically significant difference (P = 0.379).Fig. 3Structural Equation Model Testing the Association of IL-6 with Somatic/Neurovegetative and Psychological Symptom Latent VariablesFootnote: Confirmatory factor analysis computed somatic and psychological factors, which were used as outcome variables in relation to IL-6 in SEM. The path co-efficient for the association between IL and 6 and the somatic factor was adjusted for the psychological factor, and vice versa.3.5Effect of multiple testingIL-6 was associated with 11 depressive symptoms before adjusting for potential confounders (Supplementary Table 2). Evidence for association remained for three symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbances and hopelessness) after correcting observed P-values for multiple testing (Table 2).Table 2Corrected P-values for the Association between IL-6 and Depressive Symptoms using the Holm–Bonferroni Method.Depressive SymptomOriginal P-valueaCorrected P-valueFatigue3.6 × 10^−70.0000038Sleep disturbances0.0010.018Concentration difficulties0.0080.120Irritability0.0160.208Depressed/low mood0.2150.860Suicidality0.0930.588Worry0.0400.400Phobia0.0200.240Anxiety0.1180.590Panic0.9880.988Psychomotor change0.0270.297Change in appetite/weight0.2930.879Diurnal mood variation0.0520.468Anhedonia0.0130.182Hopelessness0.0010.018Low self-esteem0.0040.064Self-blame0.0840.588Decreased libido0.3010.879Physical symptoms0.0620.496aThe P-values correspond to unadjusted RRs presented in Supplementary Table 2: RR for each symptom at age 18 years for participants in the top, compared with bottom, third of the distribution of serum IL-6 levels at age 9.3.6Effect of missing dataTo explore the potential impact of differential participant attrition over time, we compared participants in the IL-6 analytic sample (i.e. data present for both IL-6 and depressive symptom) with those in the missing sample (i.e. data present for IL-6 and missing depressive symptom). IL-6 levels, BMI, self-reported infection and British White ethnicity were similar between the analytic and missing samples (Online Supplementary Table 4). However, participants in the missing sample were more likely to be older, male and have a poorer socioeconomic status (fathers with manual occupations) compared to those in the analytic sample.3.7Effect of acute infectionWe re-tested the associations between CRP and depressive symptoms after excluding 60 participants (1.2% of a total of 5086 participants) who had serum CRP levels >10 mg/L, an indicator of possible acute infection. The results remained virtually unchanged. CRP was not associated with any depressive symptom after adjusting for potential confounders (Online Supplementary Table 5).4DiscussionUsing longitudinal data from a general population-representative birth cohort, we have examined associations between childhood IL-6 and CRP levels and specific symptoms of depression in early adulthood. Individual symptom level analysis indicated that IL-6 was associated with diurnal mood variation, concentration difficulties, fatigue and sleep disturbances after adjusting for potential confounders. Further analyses using latent variables showed that IL-6 was associated with both somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension scores. Adjusting for confounding had a more pronounced effect on the association between CRP and depressive symptoms; CRP was not associated with any depressive symptom after adjusting for confounders.To our knowledge, this is one of the first general population-based longitudinal studies to investigate the association between inflammatory markers and specific depressive symptoms. Low-grade inflammation, as defined by elevated serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP, is associated with the diagnosis of depression (Dowlati et al., 2010, Goldsmith et al., 2016, Haapakoski et al., 2015, Howren et al., 2009), depressive symptom severity (Jokela et al., 2016, Kohler-Forsberg et al., 2017, Moieni et al., 2015) and persistent depressive symptoms (Khandaker et al., 2017b, Zalli et al., 2016). Cross-sectional studies have reported an association between inflammatory markers and somatic symptoms of depression such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and change in appetite and activity levels (Case and Stewart, 2014, Jokela et al., 2016, Kohler-Forsberg et al., 2017). We have replicated some of these findings using a longitudinal design where inflammatory markers were measured years before depressive symptoms developed. These findings are consistent with existing literature, which suggests that inflammation may be a cause for depressive symptoms, rather than simply be a consequence of the illness (Gimeno et al., 2009, Khandaker et al., 2014, Khandaker et al., 2017a).In our analysis, inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was associated with so-called somatic/neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and diurnal variation in mood. This is consistent with findings from the NESDA cohort, which reported that inflammatory markers were specifically associated with somatic symptoms of depression such as fatigue, weight gain and sleep disturbances (Duivis et al., 2013). Similarly, immuno-activation in animals and healthy volunteers leads to fatigue, psychomotor retardation and anhedonia, which are typical somatic symptoms according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for depressive episode (Brydon et al., 2008, Capuron et al., 2012, Eisenberger et al., 2010, Harrison et al., 2009, Harrison et al., 2015). Features of sickness behavior (e.g., fatigue) develop rapidly in the majority of interferon-treated cancer patients who develop depression, while psychological symptoms (e.g., low mood) develop slowly and relatively less frequently (Capuron et al., 2009, Capuron et al., 2002). Inflammation-induced somatic/neurovegetative symptoms could be important mediators of the relationship between inflammation and depression. Experimental studies including clinical trials in humans are required to test this hypothesis.One possibility is that somatic/neurovegetative symptoms affect mood by altering reward perception. Although the association between IL-6 and anhedonia was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for confounding within our dataset, previous experimental studies have reported an association between inflammation and anhedonia. In non-human primates chronic low-dose infusion of interferon-alpha leads to reduction in striatal dopamine release and anhedonia-like behavior (Felger et al., 2013). In patients with depression, plasma CRP concentration is associated with left basal ganglia glutamate levels, which, in turn, is associated with psychomotor slowing and anhedonia (Felger et al., 2016, Haroon et al., 2016). In healthy volunteers, experimental immuno-activation alters activation of reward-related brain regions (Brydon et al., 2008, Capuron et al., 2012, Eisenberger et al., 2010, Harrison et al., 2009, Harrison et al., 2015), including reduction in the ventral striatum responses to hedonic reward (Capuron et al., 2012, Eisenberger et al., 2010). In the future, RCTs and animal experimental studies could test whether altered reward perception mediate the relationship between somatic/neurovegetative symptoms and cognitive/psychological symptoms of depression following immuno-modulation.Association of inflammation with specific symptoms indicate that these symptoms could be important treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs for depression. Selecting patients based on inflammation levels may be a fruitful strategy for clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs (Kappelmann et al., 2018, Raison et al., 2013). Similarly, focusing on specific symptoms or symptom dimensions as outcomes may also be useful. Somatic/neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances have considerable negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life in patients with physical illness (Janardhan and Bakshi, 2002). There is little work on the impact of somatic/neurovegetative symptoms on quality of life in patients with depression. Studies exploring the burden and impact of these symptoms in patients with depression are required.We have defined certain depressive symptoms as ‘somatic/neurovegetative’ based on the ICD-10: DCR-10 criteria for depressive episode, somatic syndrome (see Methods) (WHO, 1992). This is also informed by the experimental animal literature, where certain inflammation-induced symptoms such as anorexia, decreased motor activity, loss of interest and sleep disturbances are often described as sickness behavior or neurovegetative symptoms (Dantzer et al., 2008). The ICD-10 somatic symptoms of depression can be broadly seen as the human analogue of animal neurovegetative symptoms because these symptoms overlap, albeit not completely. However, we acknowledge that there are inconsistencies in the use of the term ‘somatic’ in the literature. It has also been used to refer to bodily distress, such as palpitations, tightness of the chest, pain, etc. (Kapfhammer, 2006). This is not the same as the somatic syndrome currently defined by ICD-10: DCR:10 criteria for depression. Our use of the term is conceptually aligned with the ICD-10 definition of somatic syndrome in humans and inflammation-induced neurovegetative symptoms in animal studies, rather than bodily distress reflecting worry.Strengths of this study include a relatively large general population-based sample, longitudinal design and assessment of an array of depressive symptoms, 19 in total. However, there are some key limitations. Firstly, CRP was not associated with any depressive symptom which was surprising since IL-6 is a key inducer of CRP (Janeway et al., 2001). The use of non-fasting blood samples may have increased measurement error and is likely to have biased the findings toward the null. We adjusted our results for a number of potential confounders, but residual confounding could still be an alternative explanation for the observed associations between IL-6 and somatic symptoms. However, our work using Mendelian randomization analysis suggest that the association between IL-6/CRP and depression is likely to be causal (Khandaker et al., 2018a, Khandaker et al., 2018b).Serum IL-6 and CRP levels in our sample were generally low (Section 2.2), which could be due to the young age of the participants. The reported mean serum CRP levels in adults (mean age: 57 years) within a large community-based Danish study were higher in comparison with those in the relatively young ALSPAC sample aged 9 years. In the Danish sample, CRP levels further increased after a 10-year follow-up period (Wium-Andersen et al., 2013).Another significant limitation is the attrition of study participants between the time points of blood collection and depressive symptom assessment. Missingness was associated with older age, male sex and poorer SES. Older age and lower SES are both associated with depression. An over-representation of individuals within these groups within the missing sample could introduce a bias towards the null. Therefore, we are likely to have underestimated the true association between IL and 6 and specific depressive symptoms.In summary, our findings indicate that childhood IL-6 levels are associated with specific symptoms of depression in early adulthood. Associations with so-called somatic/neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and diurnal mood variation indicate that these symptoms could be useful treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs for depression.Declaration of interestNone of the authors has any conflicts of interest to declare.FundingThe UK Medical Research Council and Wellcome (Grant ref: 102215/2/13/2) and the University of Bristol provide core support for ALSPAC.

We shed light on structural brain differences in psychosis using an approach called morphometric similarity mapping, which quantifies the structural similarity between brain regions. Morphometric similarity was globally reduced in psychosis patients in three independent datasets, implying that patients’ brain regions were more differentiated from each other and less interconnected. Similarity was especially decreased in frontal and temporal regions. This anatomical pattern was correlated with expression of genes enriched for nervous system development and synaptic signaling and genes previously associated with schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatments. Therefore, we begin to see how combining genomics and imaging can give a more integrative understanding of schizophrenia, which might inform future treatments.Schizophrenia has been conceived as a disorder of brain connectivity, but it is unclear how this network phenotype is related to the underlying genetics. We used morphometric similarity analysis of MRI data as a marker of interareal cortical connectivity in three prior case–control studies of psychosis: in total, n = 185 cases and n = 227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced morphometric similarity in all three studies. There was also a replicable pattern of case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity, which was significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas but increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data, we found that the cortical map of case–control differences in morphometric similarity was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms and pathways. In addition, genes that were normally overexpressed in cortical areas with reduced morphometric similarity were significantly up-regulated in three prior post mortem studies of schizophrenia. We propose that this combined analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides insight into how previously implicated genes and proteins as well as a number of unreported genes in their topological vicinity on the protein interaction network may drive structural brain network changes mediating the genetic risk of schizophrenia.dysconnectivitypsychosisnetwork neurosciencemorphometric similarityAllen Human Brain AtlasEuropean Commission (EC)501100000780603196Sarah E MorganCristina ScarpazzaTherese Van AmelsvoortMachteld MarcelisJim Van OsGary DonohoeDavid MothersillAiden P.

However, despite significant efforts, the brain architectural changes and biological mechanisms causing psychotic disorders are not yet well understood, and there has been correspondingly limited progress in the development of new therapeutics.MRI studies of schizophrenia have robustly demonstrated local structural differences in multiple cortical areas, subcortical nuclei, and white matter tracts (1). The most parsimonious explanation of this distributed, multicentric pattern of structural change is that it reflects disruption or dysconnectivity of large-scale brain networks comprising anatomically connected brain areas. However, testing this dysconnectivity hypothesis of psychotic disorder has been constrained by the fundamental challenges in measuring anatomical connectivity and brain anatomical networks in humans. The principal imaging methods available for this purpose are tractographic analysis of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and structural covariance analysis of conventional MRI. DWI-based tractography generally underestimates the strength of long-distance anatomical connections: for example, between bilateral homologous areas of cortex. Structural covariance analysis is not applicable to single-subject analysis, and its biological interpretation is controversial (2).We recently proposed a technique known as “morphometric similarity mapping” (3), which quantifies the similarity between cortical areas in terms of multiple MRI parameters measured at each area and can be used to construct whole-brain anatomical networks for individual subjects. In keeping with histological results indicating that cytoarchitectonically similar areas of cortex are more likely to be anatomically connected (4), morphometric similarity in the macaque cortex was correlated with tract-tracing measurements of axonal connectivity. Compared with both tractographic DWI-based networks and structural covariance networks, morphometric similarity networks included a greater proportion of connections between human cortical areas of the same cytoarchitectonic class. Individual differences in regional mean morphometric similarity or “hubness” of cortical nodes in morphometric similarity networks accounted for about 40% of the individual differences in intelligence quotient (IQ) in a sample of 300 healthy young people. These results suggest that morphometric similarity mapping could provide a useful tool to analyze psychologically relevant biological differences in brain structure.Here, we used morphometric similarity mapping to test the dysconnectivity hypothesis of psychosis in three independent case–control MRI datasets: the Maastricht Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP) study (83 cases and 68 controls) and the Dublin study (33 cases and 82 controls), both made available as legacy datasets for the PSYSCAN project (5), as well as the publicly available Cobre dataset (69 cases and 77 controls) (Materials and Methods). We mapped case–control morphometric similarity differences at global and nodal levels of resolution individually in each dataset to assess replicability, and we tested for significant differences in network organization that were consistent across studies. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to test the hypothesis that this MRI network phenotype of psychosis was correlated with anatomically patterned gene expression using data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). This analytical approach to combine imaging and genomic data has been methodologically established (6, 7) and applied in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders (8, 9). We used it to test the pathogenic hypothesis that the genes most strongly associated with case–control differences in morphometric similarity were enriched: (i) for genes that have been ontologically linked to relevant neurobiological processes and (ii) for genes that are abnormally expressed in post mortem studies of schizophrenia.ResultsSamples.Sociodemographic and clinical data available on the sample are in SI Appendix, Table S1. There was considerable heterogeneity in clinical measures between studies (e.g., the Maastricht patients had relatively low mean scores on psychotic symptom scales).Case–Control Differences in Global Morphometric Similarity.Globally, morphometric similarity was reduced in cases compared with controls in all three datasets (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Regional morphometric similarity had an approximately normal distribution over all 308 regions (after regressing age, sex, and age × sex) and, in all three datasets, there was a significant case–control difference in this distribution (P<0.001, Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test). Modal values of regional morphometric similarity were more frequent and extreme values were less frequent in cases compared with controls (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2).Fig. 1.Case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity.

Control morphometric similarity (from C) is strongly negatively correlated with case–control morphometric similarity differences (from D; Pearson’s r = −0.76, P<0.001). Most cortical regions have positive morphometric similarity in controls, which decreases in cases (47% of regions), or negative morphometric similarity in controls, which increases in cases (36% of regions). Statistically significant regions are circled in red or blue according to whether their mean t statistic increases or decreases, respectively, in patients. MS, morphometric similarity.Case–Control Differences in Regional Morphometric Similarity.The cortical map of regional morphometric similarity in Fig. 1C summarizes the anatomical distribution of areas of positive and negative similarity on average over controls from all three datasets. The results are similar to those reported in an independent sample (3), with high positive morphometric similarity in frontal and temporal cortical areas and high negative morphometric similarity in occipital, somatosensory, and motor cortices. This confirms the replicability of this pattern of regional morphometric similarity in healthy individuals and is consistent with prior knowledge that primary cortex is more histologically differentiated than association cortex.We mapped the t statistics and corresponding Hedge’s g effect sizes for the case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity at each cortical area (Fig. 1D). A positive t statistic means that morphometric similarity increased in patients, whereas a negative t statistic means that morphometric similarity decreased. We found somewhat similar patterns of case–control difference across all three datasets, with increased regional morphometric similarity in occipital and parietal areas in patients and decreased regional morphometric similarity in frontal and temporal cortices. The case–control t map for the Dublin study was significantly correlated with both the Maastricht and the Cobre t maps (r=0.42, P<0.001 and r=0.47, P<0.001, respectively), although the Maastricht and Cobre t maps were not significantly correlated (r=0.058, P=0.31) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). However, a large number of patients in the Maastricht dataset had very low symptom scores [below the threshold for “borderline mentally ill” (10)]. If those nonpsychotic patients were excluded from the analysis, the Maastricht case–control t map was correlated significantly with the Cobre map (r = 0.22, P<0.001) (SI Appendix, section S6.2).Combining the P values for case–control differences across all three datasets, we identified 18 cortical regions where morphometric similarity was robustly and significantly different between groups (Fig. 1E). Morphometric similarity decreased in patients in 15 regions located in the superior frontal, caudal middle frontal, precentral, pars triangularis, and superior temporal areas and increased in 3 regions located in superior parietal and postcentral areas (SI Appendix, Table S2).To contextualize the regional morphometric similarity case–control differences, we referred them to two prior classifications of cortical areas: the von Economo atlas of cortex classified by cytoarchitectonic criteria (6) and the Yeo atlas of cortex classified according to resting-state networks derived from fMRI (11, 12). Morphometric similarity was significantly reduced in von Economo class 2 (association cortex) and in the ventral attention, frontoparietal, and default mode fMRI networks (all PFDR<0.05) (SI Appendix, Tables S12 and S13).There was a strong negative correlation between regional morphometric similarity in the control subjects and the case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity (both averaged over all three datasets; Pperm=0.002) (Fig. 1F). Hence, areas with the highest positive morphometric similarity in controls tended to show the greatest decrease of morphometric similarity in patients, and conversely, areas with the highest negative morphometric similarity in healthy controls had the greatest increase of morphometric similarity in psychosis. This result is analogous to the observation that highly connected “hub” regions are the most likely to show reduced connectivity in disease in fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) brain networks (13).We tested for correlations between mean morphometric similarity and a range of clinical measures, including symptom scores, antipsychotic medication use, and cannabis use (SI Appendix, section S6.3). The only significant associations after false discovery rate (FDR) correction were with cannabis use, which was positively correlated with mean global morphometric similarity in the Maastricht study (PFDR=5×10−4) as well as with mean morphometric similarity averaged across the 15 regions with significantly decreased morphometric similarity in Fig. 1E (PFDR = 0.0017).Gene Expression Related to Morphometric Similarity.We used PLS regression to identify patterns of gene expression that were correlated with the anatomical distribution of case–control morphometric similarity differences. The first PLS component explained 13% of the variance in the case–control morphometric similarity differences combining data from all three studies, significantly more than expected by chance (permutation test, P<0.001). PLS1 gene expression weights were positively correlated with case–control morphometric similarity differences in the Dublin study (r=0.49, P<0.001) and the Cobre study (r=0.37, P<0.001) (Fig. 2A) but not in the Maastricht study (r=0.006, P=0.94). These positive correlations mean that genes positively weighted on PLS1 are overexpressed in regions where morphometric similarity was increased in patients, while negatively weighted genes are overexpressed in regions where morphometric similarity was decreased in patients (Fig. 2D). Hence, genes that are positively (or negatively) weighted on PLS1 were related to increased (or decreased) morphometric similarity in cases compared with controls.Fig. 2.Gene expression profiles related to case–control differences in morphometric similarity.

(B) Cortical map of regional PLS1 scores. (C) Cortical map of mean case–control morphometric similarity differences averaged across all datasets. Here, we include intrahemispheric left hemisphere edges only (Materials and Methods). (D) Genes that are strongly positively weighted on PLS1 (e.g., LYSMD4) correlate positively with case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity (r=0.44, P<0.001), whereas genes that are strongly negatively weighted on PLS1 (e.g., C1orf95) correlate negatively with case–control differences in morphometric similarity (r=−0.37, P<0.001).Enrichment Analysis of Genes Transcriptionally Related to Morphometric Similarity.We found 1,110 genes with normalized PLS1 weights Z<−3, which we denote the PLS− gene set, and 1,979 genes with Z>3, which we denote the PLS+ gene set. We first consider PLS− genes (the equivalent results for PLS+ genes are also given below).We mapped the network of known interactions between proteins coded by the PLS− gene set (14) (Fig. 3). The resulting protein–protein interaction (PPI) network had 341 connected proteins and 1,022 edges, significantly more than the 802 edges expected by chance (permutation test, P<1−13). We also tested the PLS− gene set for significant gene ontology (GO) enrichment of biological processes and enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Enriched biological processes included “nervous system development,” “synaptic signaling,” and “adenylate cyclase-modulating G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway” (Dataset S1). There were two significantly enriched KEGG pathways: “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction” and “retrograde endocannabinoid signaling” (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). The proteins coded by genes enriched for adenylate cyclase-modulating GPCR signaling pathway and the two KEGG pathways formed the most strongly interconnected cluster of nodes in the PPI network (Fig. 3), compatible with them sharing a specialized functional role for GPCR signaling.Fig. 3.Enrichment analysis of genes transcriptionally related to morphometric similarity. (A) PPI network for PLS− genes (Z<−3) highlighted with some of the significantly GO-enriched biological processes: nervous system development in red and adenylate cyclase-modulating GPCR signaling pathway in blue. The most interconnected set of proteins was coded by several genes previously implicated in schizophrenia (highlighted in B; details are in the text and SI Appendix, section S8.8).Genes recently reported as overexpressed in post mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia (15) were highly enriched among genes that were negatively weighted on PLS1 (permutation test, P<0.001 after FDR correction). The relationship between the sign of PLS1 weights of gene expression related to the MRI case–control phenotype, and the sign of case–control differences in the histological measures of brain gene expression, was highly nonrandom (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P
<10−26).In other words, genes that were up-regulated in post mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia are normally overexpressed in association cortical areas that have reduced morphometric similarity in psychosis. This association between gene expression in regions with reduced morphometric similarity and genes up-regulated in schizophrenia was replicated by analysis of two alternative datasets provided by the PsychENCODE consortium (16) and in ref. 17 (SI Appendix, section S8.5). We also observed enrichment by genes up-regulated in other psychiatric disorders (e.g., autistic spectrum disorders), which is compatible with the substantial overlap between genes that are up-regulated (or down-regulated) in common between schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders (16).The PLS+ genes coded proteins that formed a PPI network with significantly more edges than expected by chance (P
<10−6), which was enriched for the biological process “nucleic acid metabolic process” but no KEGG pathways (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Genes that are down-regulated post mortem in schizophrenia (15) were highly enriched among genes that were positively weighted on PLS1 (permutation test, P<0.001 after FDR correction). This result was reproduced with genes reported as down-regulated in schizophrenia in ref. 17, although not by the PsychENCODE consortium (16) (SI Appendix, section S8.5).There was no significant enrichment of PLS− or PLS+ genes for common sequence variants associated with schizophrenia derived from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and CLOZUK samples (18) (P>0.05).DiscussionMorphometric Similarity Network Phenotypes.Morphometric similarity mapping disclosed a robust and replicable cortical pattern of differences in psychosis patients. Morphometric similarity was significantly reduced in frontal and temporal cortical areas and significantly increased in parietal cortical areas. This pattern was consistent across three independent datasets with different samples, locations, scanners, and scanning parameters.What does this MRI phenotype of psychosis represent? Morphometric similarity quantifies the correspondence or kinship of two cortical areas in terms of multiple macrostructural features (e.g., cortical thickness) and microstructural features [e.g., fractional anisotropy (FA)] that are measurable by MRI. We assume that high morphometric similarity between a pair of cortical regions indicates that there is a high degree of correspondence between them in terms of cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic features that we cannot directly observe given the limited spatial resolution and cellular specificity of MRI. Prior work also showed that morphometrically similar cortical regions are more likely to be axonally connected to each other (i.e., morphometric similarity is a proxy marker for anatomical connectivity) (3). We, therefore, interpret the reduced morphometric similarity that we observe in frontal and temporal brain regions in psychosis as indicating that there is reduced architectonic similarity or greater architectonic differentiation between these areas and the rest of the cortex, which is probably indicative of reduced anatomical connectivity to and from the less similar, more differentiated cortical areas.There is a well-evidenced and articulated prior theory of schizophrenia as a dysconnectivity syndrome; specifically, functional dysconnectivity of frontal and temporal cortical areas has been recognized as a marker of brain network disorganization in schizophrenia (19). Our results of reduced morphometric similarity in frontal and temporal cortices—implying increased architectonic differentiation and decreased axonal connectivity—are descriptively consistent with this theory. Our complementary finding of abnormally increased morphometric similarity in parietal cortex—implying increased architectonic similarity and axonal connectivity—is plausible but not so clearly precedented given the relatively limited prior data on the parietal cortex in studies of schizophrenia as a dysconnectivity syndrome (20, 21).Encouragingly, this MRI network marker of psychosis was highly reliable across three independent and methodologically various case–control studies. This implies that the measurement is robust enough to be plausible as a candidate imaging biomarker of cortical network organization in large-scale, multicenter studies of psychosis.Transcriptional Profiling of Morphometric Similarity Network Phenotypes.In an effort to connect these MRI phenotypes to the emerging genetics and functional genomics of schizophrenia, we first used PLS to identify the weighted combination of genes in the whole genome that has a cortical expression map most similar to the cortical map of case–control morphometric similarity differences. Then, we tested the mechanistic hypothesis that the genes with greatest (positive or negative) weight on PLS1 were enriched for genes previously implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.We found that the genes that are normally overexpressed in frontal and temporal areas of reduced morphometric similarity in psychosis were significantly enriched for genes that are up-regulated in post mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia (15). Conversely, the genes that are normally overexpressed in parietal and other areas of increased morphometric similarity in psychosis were significantly enriched for genes that are down-regulated in post mortem data (15). This tight coupling between MRI-derived transcriptional weights and gene transcription measured histologically was highly significant and the association with up-regulated genes was replicated across three prior post mortem datasets.Additional investigation showed that the proteins coded by the PLS− genes formed a dense, topologically clustered interaction network that was significantly enriched for a number of relevant GO biological processes and KEGG pathways. The cluster of interactive proteins related to GPCR signaling included multiple proteins coded by genes previously linked to antipsychotic mechanisms of action [including DRD4 (22), HTR1 (23), NTSR1 (24), and ADRA2C (25)], reported in transcriptional studies of post mortem brain tissue [e.g., PTGER3, S1PR1, ITPR2, and EDNRB (15, 26)], or associated with risk SNPs for schizophrenia [e.g., DRD5, OPRM1, and CNR1 (27–29)]. The remarkable density of therapeutically relevant genes in the GPCR-related cluster suggests that other topologically neighboring genes may deserve additional attention as targets for antipsychotic interventions.Risk genes identified by the largest extant GWAS of schizophrenia were not significantly enriched among PLS− or PLS+ genes. Nevertheless, the involvement of PLS− genes farther down the causal pathway is still mechanistically revealing and potentially useful.Methodological Considerations.Some limitations of this study should be highlighted. The whole-brain data on “normal” brain tissue expression of the genome were measured post mortem in six adult brains (mean age = 43 y) and not in age-matched subjects or patients with schizophrenia (such data are not currently available to our knowledge). Also, the transcriptional experiments that we use to label genes as up- or down-regulated in schizophrenia were performed in regions of the parietal or prefrontal cortex (15), whereas the neuroimaging results are for the whole brain. We have used MRI data from three independent studies to measure morphometric similarity networks, but the studies used different scanning protocols, leading to estimation of morphometric similarity between regions on the basis of seven MRI parameters that were measurable in all studies. Future work could usefully explore the opportunity to further improve sensitivity and reliability of the morphometric similarity network biomarker of schizophrenia by optimizing and standardizing the MRI procedures to measure the most informative set of morphometric features. Finally, the datasets have varied, limited clinical information available, making it difficult to assess the clinical significance of the morphometric similarity phenotype.Materials and MethodsSamples.We used MRI data from three prior case–control studies: the Maastricht GROUP study (30) from The Netherlands; the Dublin dataset, which was acquired and scanned at the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience as part of a Science Foundation Ireland-funded neuroimaging genetics study (“A structural and functional MRI investigation of genetics, cognition and emotion in schizophrenia”); and the publicly available Cobre dataset (31). The Maastricht and Dublin datasets were PSYSCAN legacy datasets. The standing ethics committee of Maastricht University Medical Center approved the Maastricht GROUP study. The St. James Hospital and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin Incorporating the National Children’s Hospital (AMNCH) joint ethics boards approved the Dublin study. All participants gave informed consent. All patients satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or other nonaffective psychotic disorders. MRI data were quality controlled for motion artifacts (SI Appendix, section S1). The Euler number, which quantifies image quality (32), was not significantly different between groups in any of the studies, but it was different between studies, indicating that the studies were ranked Dublin > Cobre > Maastricht in terms of image quality (SI Appendix, Table S1).Morphometric Similarity Mapping.The T1-weighted MRI data [magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence] and the DWI data from all participants were preprocessed using a previously defined computational pipeline (6). Briefly, we used the recon-all (33) and trac-all (34) commands from FreeSurfer (version 6.0). Following ref. 3, the surfaces were then parcellated using an atlas with 308 cortical regions derived from the Desikan–Killiany atlas (6, 35). For each region, we estimated seven parameters from the MRI and DWI data: gray matter volume, surface area, cortical thickness, Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, FA, and mean diffusivity. Each parameter was normalized for sample mean and SD before estimation of Pearson’s correlation for each pair of Z-scored morphometric feature vectors, which were compiled to form a 308×308 morphometric similarity matrix Mi for each participant, i=1,…N (3).Case–Control Analysis of Morphometric Similarity Networks.The global mean morphometric similarity for each participant is the average of Mi. The regional mean MSi,j for the ith participant at each region j=1,…,308 is the average of the jth row (or column) of Mi. Thus regional MS strength is equivalent to the weighted degree or hubness of each regional node, connected by signed and weighted edges of pair-wise similarity to all other nodes in the whole brain connectome represented by the morphometric similarity matrix. For global and regional morphometric similarity statistics alike, we fit linear models to estimate case–control difference, with age, sex, and age × sex as covariates. Our main results also replicated in subsets of the data balanced for age and sex (SI Appendix, section S5.6). P values for case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity were combined across all three studies using Fisher’s method. The resulting P value for each region was thresholded for significance using FDR<0.05, to control type 1 error over multiple (308) tests.Transcriptomic Analysis.We used the AHBA transcriptomic dataset with gene expression measurements in six post mortem adult brains (36) (human.brain-map.org) ages 24–57 y. Each tissue sample was assigned to an anatomical structure using the AHBA MRI data for each donor (37). Samples were pooled between bilaterally homologous cortical areas. Regional expression levels for each gene were compiled to form a 308×20,647 regional transcription matrix (37). Since the AHBA only includes data for the right hemisphere for two subjects, in our analyses relating gene expression to MRI data, we only consider intrahemispheric left hemisphere edges (38).We used PLS to relate the regional morphometric similarity case–control differences (t statistics from the 152 cortical regions in the left hemisphere calculated from intrahemispheric edges only) to the post mortem gene expression measurements for all 20, 647 genes. PLS uses the gene expression measurements (the predictor variables) to predict the regional morphometric similarity case-control t statistics from all three datasets (the response variables). The first PLS component (PLS1) is the linear combination of the weighted gene expression scores that have a cortical expression map that is most strongly correlated with the map of case–control morphometric similarity differences. The statistical significance of the variance explained by PLS1 was tested by permuting the response variables 1,000 times. The error in estimating each gene’s PLS1 weight was assessed by bootstrapping (resampling with replacement of the 308 cortical regions), and the ratio of the weight of each gene to its bootstrap SE was used to calculate the Z scores and, hence, rank the genes according to their contribution to PLS1 (6).We constructed PPI networks from the genes with PLS1 weights Z>3 and Z<−3 (all FDR<0.05) using STRING version 10.5 (14). Our key results were robust to changing these thresholds to Z>4 and Z<−4 (all FDR<0.01) (SI Appendix, section S8.3). We used DAVID (39, 40) to calculate enrichments of KEGG pathways and GO enrichments of biological processes for genes with Z>3 or Z<−3 using a background gene list of 15,745 brain-expressed genes (SI Appendix, section S8.3) (38).We used a resampling procedure to test for enrichment of PLS-derived gene sets by genes previously associated with schizophrenia by transcriptional data (15). The median rank of each risk gene set in the PLS gene list was compared with the median rank of 10,000 randomly selected brain-expressed gene sets (3).Data and Code Availability.The data used for the analyses are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7908488.v1 (5) and the code can be found at https://github.com/SarahMorgan/Morphometric_Similarity_SZ (41).Supplementary MaterialSupplementary FileSupplementary FileSupplementary FileSupplementary FileSupplementary FileThis study was supported by European Commission Grant PSYSCAN—Translating neuroimaging findings from research into clinical practice 603196 and an National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Center (Mental Health) Grant.

However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N = 204 (N = 32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N = 176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and Ωnyx).KeywordsLatent change scoresLongitudinal modellingDevelopmentIndividual differencesStructural equation modellingAdolescence1IntroductionWhen thinking about any repeated measures analysis it is best to ask first, what is your model for change? (McArdle, 2009, p. 579)Developmental cognitive neuroscience is concerned with how cognitive and neural processes change during development, and how they interact to give rise to a rich and rapidly fluctuating profile of cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes. Many, if not all, central questions in the field can be conceived as related to the temporal dynamics of multivariate brain-behaviour relations. Theories in developmental cognitive neuroscience often implicitly or explicitly suggest causal hypotheses about the direction of the association between variables of interest, the temporal precedence of their emergence, and the likely consequences of interventions. For instance, the maturational viewpoint (e.g. Gesell, 1929; cf. Johnson, 2011, Segalowitz and Rose-Krasnor, 1992) proposes that development of key brain regions (e.g. the frontal lobes) is a necessary precondition to acquiring psychological capacities (e.g. cognitive control or inhibition). This represents a clear causal pathway, where developmental change in neural regions precedes, and causes, changes in faculties associated with those regions (also known as developmental epigenesis). This is contrasted with interactive specialisation theory (Johnson, 2011), where probabilistic epigenesis posits bidirectional causal influences from mental function to brain structure and function. These competing theories make explicit claims about the temporal order of development, as well as the causal interactions between explanatory levels. Similarly, developmental mismatch theory (Ahmed et al., 2015, Mills et al., 2014, Steinberg, 2008, van den Bos and Eppinger, 2016) suggests that a key explanation of risk taking behaviour in adolescence is the delayed development of brain regions associated with cognitive control (e.g. the frontal lobe) compared to regions associated with mediating emotional responses (e.g. the amygdala). This too posits a clear brain-behaviour dynamic, where a mismatch between maturation in executive brain regions compared to emotion systems is hypothesized to affect the likelihood of certain (mal)adaptive behaviours. Empirical examples of such questions show, for instance, that frontoparietal structural connectivity (but not functional connectivity) determined longitudinal changes in reasoning ability (Wendelken et al., 2017).An active area of research where cognitive or behavioural changes are presumed to precede changes in brain structure or function is that of training-induced plasticity. For instance, Bengtsson et al. (2005) found that degree and intensity of piano practice in childhood and adolescence correlated with regionally specific differences in white matter structure, and that this effect was more pronounced in developmental windows in which maturation was ongoing. This was interpreted as evidence of training-induced plasticity, suggesting that behavioural modifications (i.e. prolonged practice) preceded, and caused, measurable changes in white matter structure.1 More direct longitudinal evidence in 845 children scanned on two occasions suggests that grey matter volume and changes in white matter microstructure are slower in individuals with more severe psychiatric symptoms, but not vice versa. This is compatible with (although not conclusive evidence of) the hypothesis that differences in structural changes are consequences, not causes, of psychiatric symptoms (Muetzel et al., 2017).Although such questions are characterized by a fundamental interest in temporal dynamics and causality, much of the literature is dominated by cross-sectional (age-heterogeneous) data that are ill equipped to resolve these questions (Lindenberger and Poetter, 1998, Lindenberger et al., 2011, Salthouse, 2014). For instance, individual differences in brain structure may precede differential changes in cognitive abilities (e.g. certain clinical conditions), or changes in cognitive abilities may trigger measurable changes in brain structure (e.g. learning-induced plasticity). Although these hypotheses imply radically different causal pathways and (potential) intervention strategies, they are often indistinguishable in cross-sectional data. Moreover, aggregated cross-sectional data can be affected by cohort effects (i.e. different populations) which in turn can lead to overestimates (e.g. cohort differences, Sliwinski et al., 2010), underestimates (e.g. selective attrition, training effects; Willis and Schaie, 1986), and even full reversals of the direction of effects observed between groups compared to within groups (Kievit et al., 2013). Most crucially, cross-sectional aggregations do capture change at the individual level, nor individual differences in intra-individual change (Baltes et al., 1977). Thus, they fail to directly address the most fundamental questions of developmental science: How and why do people differ in the way they develop?The recent rapid increase in the study of large, longitudinal, imaging cohorts (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014) provides unprecedented opportunities to study these key questions. Here we introduce a class of Structural Equation Models called Latent Change Score Models that are specifically tailored to overcome various weaknesses of more traditional approaches, and are well suited to address hypotheses about temporal, interactive dynamics over time.2Towards a model-based longitudinal developmental cognitive neuroscienceStructural equation modelling (SEM) combines the strengths of path modelling and latent variable modelling and has a long tradition in the social sciences (Bollen, 1989, Tomarken and Waller, 2005). Path modelling (an extension of (multiple) regression) allows for simultaneous estimation of multiple hypothesized relationships, specification of directed relations that correspond to hypothesised causal pathways, and models in which constructs may function as both dependent and independent variables. Latent variable modelling allows researchers to use observed (manifest) variables to make inferences and test theories about unobserved (latent) variables.In offering a flexible framework for multivariate analyses SEM has several key strengths compared to other methods of analysis (Rodgers and Lee, 2010). First, SEM forces researchers to posit an explicit model, representing some hypothesized explanatory account of the data, which is then compared to the observed data (usually a covariance matrix, or a covariance matrix and a vector of means). The extent to which the hypothesized model can reproduce the observations is adduced as evidence in favour of, or against, some proposed model of the construct under investigation. Moreover, SEM helps make researchers aware of assumptions that may be hidden in other approaches (e.g., assumptions of equal variances across groups).2 Second, by using latent variables researchers can account for measurement error in observed scores. This strategy not only increases power to detect true effects (van der Sluis et al., 2010), but also offers greater validity and generalizability in research designs (Little et al., 1999). Specifically, it can be used to test for bias across subgroups (e.g. tests functioning differently for different subgroups, Wicherts et al., 2005) and biased estimates across developmental time (Wicherts et al., 2004), and improve the use of covariates (Westfall and Yarkoni, 2016).In recent decades, various extensions of SEM have been developed for longitudinal, or repeated measures, data (McArdle, 2009). More traditional techniques (e.g. repeated measures ANOVA) are rarely tailored to the complex error structure of longitudinal data, neglect individual differences and are not developed explicitly to test the predictions that follow from causal hypotheses across a whole set of variables simultaneously. The longitudinal SEM framework, closely related to general linear mixed modelling (Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2013, Rovine and Molenaar, 2001), is so flexible that many common statistical procedures such as t-tests, regressions, and repeated measures (M)ANOVA can be considered special cases of longitudinal SEM models (Voelkle, 2007). Common procedures in developmental cognitive (neuro)science including cross-lagged panel models or simple regressions (on either raw or difference scores) can be considered special cases of LCSM’s, but without various benefits associated with SEM such as reduction of measurement error and incorporation of stable individual differences (Hamaker et al., 2015).Examples of longitudinal SEM include latent growth curve models, latent change score models, growth mixture models, latent class growth curve modelling and continuous time modelling (Driver et al., 2016, McArdle, 2009). In the next section we describe a specific subtype of longitudinal SEM known as the Latent Change Score Models (LCS, sometimes also called Latent Difference Score models) (McArdle and Hamagami, 2001b, McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994). This particular class of models is especially versatile and useful for researchers in developmental cognitive neuroscience as it can model change at the construct level, can be used with a relatively modest number of time points (a minimum of 2, although more are desirable) and is especially powerful for testing cross-domain (i.e. brain behaviour) couplings.3The Latent Change Score modelLatent Change Score models (McArdle and Hamagami, 2001b, McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994) are a powerful and flexible class of Structural Equation Models that offer ways to test a wide range of developmental hypotheses with relative ease. LCSMs have been used to considerable effect in developmental (cognitive) psychology to show a range of effects including that vocabulary affects reading comprehension but not vice versa (Quinn et al., 2015), that people with dyslexia show fewer intellectual benefits from reading than controls (Ferrer et al., 2010), that positive transfer of cognitive training generalizes beyond the item-level to cognitive ability (Schmiedek et al., 2010), that volume changes of the hippocampus and prefrontal white matter are reliably correlated in adulthood and old age (Raz et al., 2005), that an age-related decline in white matter changes is associated with declines in fluid intelligence (Ritchie et al., 2015) and that basic cognitive abilities such as reasoning and vocabulary show mutualistic benefits over time that may partially explain positive correlations among cognitive abilities (Kievit et al., 2017). One of the first applications of LCS in cognitive neuroscience showed that ventricle size in an elderly population predicted rate of decline on memory tests across a seven year interval (McArdle et al., 2004). There are several excellent tutorials on longitudinal SEM (Ghisletta and McArdle, 2012, Grimm, 2007, Jajodia and Archana, 2012, McArdle and Grimm, 2010, Petscher et al., 2016, Snitz et al., 2015, Usami et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2015), and the approach we outline below builds heavily upon this previous work, where we illustrate LCS models specifically in the context of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience. We will start with the simplest model, using one variable measured on two occasions, and then present four extensions of the model. These extensions will sequentially incorporate latent variables, add multiple coupled domains (cognitive and neural measures), extend to multiple time waves (latent growth- and dual change score models) and finally test for differences in multiple groups. After discussing each of the basic models in turn, we will cover methodological challenges including estimation, model fit, interpretation and model comparison. For each of the five types of models we discussed below, we provide example syntax that simulates data under a selected parameterisation and fits the model in question to the data. These scripts are freely available at the Open Science Framework https://osf.io/4bpmq/files/ to be used, modified and extended by the wider community.3.1Univariate latent change score modelImagine a researcher studying a psychological variable of interest, repeatedly measured at two time points (T1 and T2) in a population of interest. A traditional way to examine whether scores of a group of individuals increased or decreased between T1 and T2 is performed by means of a paired t-test. Using some simple modifications, the LCS allows us to go beyond this traditional analysis framework even in this simplest case. The basic steps of a univariate latent change score model are as follows. To facilitate understanding, in the examples below, we will use informative notation (e.g. ‘COG’ for cognitive measures and ‘NEU’ for neural measures). For a more standard mathematical notation of the LCS we refer the reader to texts such as (McArdle, 2008, McArdle and Hamagami, 2001a, Newsom, 2015, Petscher et al., 2016). First, we conceptualize the scores of an individual i on the construct of interest COG at time t as being a function of an autoregressive component and some residual. By fixing the regression weight of COGT2 on COGT1 to 1, the autoregressive equation simplifies to(1)COGi,t2 =COGi,t1  +ΔCOGi,1 From this it follows that the change score is simply:(2)ΔCOGi,1 = COGi,t2 − COGi,t1The powerful step in the context of SEM is to define a latent change score factor ΔCOG1, which is measured by time point 2 with a factor loading fixed to 1. Doing so creates a latent factor that captures the change between time 1 and time 2. Finally, we can add an regression parameter β to the change score, which allows us to investigate whether the degree of change depends on the scores at time 1 as follows:(3)ΔCOGi,1 = β·COGi,t1With this model in place we can address three fundamental questions. The first and simplest question is whether there is a reliable average change from T1 to T2. This is captured by the mean of the latent change factor, μΔCOG1. Under relatively simple assumptions this test is equivalent to a paired t-test (Coman et al., 2013). However, even this simplest implementation of the latent change score model yields two additional parameters of considerable interest. First, we can now estimate the variance in the change factor, σ2ΔCOG1, which captures the extent to which individuals differ in the change they manifest over time. Second, we can specify either a covariance or an autoregressive parameter β which captures the extent to which change is dependent, or proportional, to the scores at time one (this parameter can also be specified as a covariance if so desired). Note that if a regression parameter is included, the mean change should be interpreted conditional on the regression path – A covariance will yield the mean ‘raw’ change.SEMs are often illustrated using path models. Such representations go back to Wright (1920), and allow researchers to represent complex causal patterns using simple visual representations. Fig. 1 shows the commonly employed symbols, meaning and notation. The simplest representation of the univariate latent change model is shown in Fig. 2, and can be fit to data measured on two occasions. As the autoregressive parameter between COGT2 and COGT1 is fixed to unity, we implicitly assume that the intervals are equidistant across individuals. Deviations from this assumption can be dealt with by rescaling scores (Ferrer and McArdle, 2004, p. 941) or, ideally, by using definition variables (Mehta and West, 2000) or continuous-time modelling approaches (Driver et al., 2016), which yield parameters that more easily generalize across different longitudinal designs. The model shown in Fig. 2 is just identified, that is, there are as many unique pieces of information that enter the model (two variances, two means and a covariance) as parameters to be estimated (one observed variance, one latent variance, one observed mean score, one latent mean score and one regression parameter). This means that although we can estimate this model, we cannot interpret model fit in isolation unless additional data (multiple waves, multiple domains or multiple indicators) are included. However, we can make use of parameter constraints, namely fixing certain parameters to zero and employ likelihood ratio testing of hypotheses about specific parameters. For instance, one can separately fit two similar models: once a model with the latent change variance parameter freely estimated, and once with the variance constrained to 0 (implying no differences in change). The difference in model fit will be chi-square distributed with k degrees of freedom, where k is the number of parameters constrained to equality (Neale, 2000; but see Stoel et al., 2006). If fixing the variance of change parameter to 0 leads to a significant drop in model fit, it would suggest that individuals change heterogeneously. However, it should be noted that this inference is only valid compared to the simpler model – a more extensive model with additional variables or time points may lead to different conclusions about heterogeneity in change. A more practical concern is that constraining variances parameters may lead to failure of model convergence which renders interpretation challenging – See Section 4.2 for more guidance. Similar procedures can be employed for any other parameter of interest or combinations of any number of parameters. The likelihood ratio test is especially suitable for parameters such as variances, as the simplifying assumptions of parameter significance tests such as the often-used Wald test may not hold (i.e. a variance cannot be negative). Next, we examine how to extend the LCS model to include latent variables.Fig. 1Basic path model notation.Fig. 1Fig. 2Univariate Latent Change Score Model. Variable COG is measured at two time points (COG_T1 and COG_T2). Change (ΔCOG1) between the two timepoints is modelled as latent variable.Fig. 23.2Multiple indicator univariate latent change score modelThe above example uses a single observed variable, which was assumed to be measured without error. We can easily extend this model to have an explicit measurement model by replacing the observed score with a latent variable, measured by a set of observed variables. We refer to this representation as a multiple indicator latent change score model, as our aim is to model change in the latent score rather than observed scores. To do so, we model a latent variable in the manner of a traditional confirmatory factor analysis, by expressing the strength of the association between the latent variable COG in individuals i (i = 1,…N) measured at times t (t = 1,…t) and the observed scores X (j = 1,…j) with factor loadings λ and error terms δ as follows:(4)Xijt = λjtCOGit + δijtA simple multiple indicator latent change score model is shown in Fig. 3. We model the mean, variance and autoregressive changes in COG as before, but now add a set of three (X1-X3) observed measurements on two occasions that each reflect the underlying cognitive construct of interest. Additionally, we allow for residual covariance of error terms across time points for each observed score with itself, represented as double-headed arrows. These so-called ‘correlated errors’ allow for indicator-specific variance across occasions and are generally included as default (Newsom, 2015, p. 103; Wheaton et al., 1977). This model is similar to the univariate latent change score model in terms of the key questions it can address (rate of change μΔCOG1, variance in change σ2ΔCOG1, and the relation between COG1 and ΔCOG1 captured by β), but includes the benefits of removing measurement error and establishing measurement invariance over time and (if necessary) across groups, improving inferences.Fig. 3Multiple indicator univariate latent change score model. The latent construct of interest (COG) is measures at two time points (COG_T1 and COG_T2) each measured using three indicators (X1, X2, X3). We assume measurement invariance and correlated residual errors over time. See text for a detailed description of the model parameters.Fig. 33.3Bivariate latent change score modelA further extension of the latent change score model is to include a second (or third, fourth, etc.) domain of interest. For convenience in notation and graphical representation we will revert back to using only observed scores, but all extensions can and – where possible should – be modelled using latent (multiple indicator) factors. We can assume the second domain is some neural measure of interest (e.g. grey matter volume in a region of interest), measured on the same number of occasions as the cognitive variable (or variables). This allows for the investigation of a powerful concept known as cross-domain coupling (Fig. 4), that captures the extent to which change in one domain (e.g. ΔCOG) is a function of the starting level in the other (i.e. NEUT1). For instance, we can quantify the extent to which cognitive changes between T1 and T2 are a function of brain structure (γ2) and cognition (β1) at T1 as follows:(5)ΔCOG1 = β1·COGi,t1 + γ2·NEUi,t1Fig. 4Bivariate Latent Change Score Model. Note: means are omitted for visual clarity.Fig. 4The implications for testing theories in developmental cognitive neuroscience should be immediately clear: the dynamic parameters, shown in red and blue in Fig. 4, capture the extent to which changes in cognition are a function of initial condition of brain measures, vice versa or both. Likelihood ratio tests or Wald tests of these dynamic parameters (brain measures affecting rates of change in cognition, or cognitive abilities affecting neural changes) furnish evidence for, or against, models that represent uni- or bidirectional hypothesized causal influences. As is clear from Fig. 4, the bivariate latent change score model can capture at least four different brain-behaviour relations of interest. First, we have brain-behaviour covariance at baseline (shown in purple), the main focus in traditional (developmental) cognitive neuroscience. Second, we have cognition to brain coupling (shown in blue, labelled γ1), where T1 scores in cognition predict the rate, or degree, of change in brain structure. For instance, the degree of childhood piano practice affected white matter structure (ΔNEU1) would predict a substantial cognition-to-neural coupling parameter γ1 (Bengtsson et al., 2005). Third, we have brain structure predicting rate, or degree, of cognitive change (shown in blue, labelled γ2). For example, McArdle et al. (2004) showed that ventricle size in an older population predicted rate of memory decline across an interval of 7 years. Finally, we have an estimate of correlated change (shown in yellow), reflecting the degree to which brain and behaviour changes co-occur after taking into account the coupling pathways. For instance, Gorbach et al. (2016) observed correlated change between hippocampal atrophy and episodic memory decline in older adults. More generally, correlated change may reflect a third, underlying variable influencing both domains. The bivariate latent change score provides a powerful analytic framework for testing a wide range of hypotheses in developmental cognitive neuroscience in a principled and rigorous manner.3.4Bivariate dual change score modelSo far, we focused on the simplest instance of longitudinal data, namely where data is measured on two occasions. This is likely to be, for the foreseeable future, the most common form of longitudinal dataset available to researchers in developmental cognitive neuroscience, and yields many benefits compared to both cross-sectional data analyses and more traditional techniques such as cross-lagged panel models or change score regression (see Section 4 for more detail). However, with a greater number of timepoints, extensions within the framework of LCS models makes it easy to capture more fine-grained dynamic processes within and across domains. For instance, a sufficient number of timepoints allows one to fit what is known as a dual change score model (Ghisletta and Lindenberger, 2003). In this model, we specify an additional latent variable, S (for slope), that captures the global increase or decrease across all time points. This latent variable is measured by the successive change scores ΔCOGt, by specifying factor loadings (α) to capture a range of dynamic shapes such as linear increase or decrease. The factor loadings of the slope factor on the constant change parameter can be fixed to a priori values to capture a range of growth processes including linear (all 1) or accelerating change (e.g. 1,2,3) – however, due to identification constraints, they cannot generally be freely estimated from the data.The ‘dual’ aspect of this model enters by separating the global process of change captured by the slope from the more local, time point-to-time point deviations from this trajectory denoted by the self-feedback (β, red pathways in Fig. 5) and cross-domain coupling (γ, blue pathways in Fig. 5) parameters. When modelled together with a neural variable the bivariate dual change score, shown graphically in Fig. 5, can be expressed as follows(6)ΔCOGi,t = αCOG·sCOGi + β1·COGi,t + γ2·NEUi,tFig. 5Bivariate Dual Change Score Model. This more complex latent change score model captures both the stable change over time in the form of slopes (sCOG and sNEU), as well as more fine-grained residual changes. Note this model incorporates latent variables at each timepoint – See Newsom (2015, p. 135) for more detail.Fig. 5This (bivariate) dual change score model is a general approach that can capture both general trends and more fine-grained temporal dynamics. This can be especially useful when trying to separate a known, more stable change occurring during development (e.g. global cortical thinning) from more high-frequency fluctuations. The dual change score model has been used in a behaviour-only context to show (a) that vocabulary influences changes in reading ability (but not vice versa) (Quinn et al., 2015); (b) bivariate dynamic coupling between subjective and objective memory problems in an ageing population (Snitz et al., 2015); (c) within-person trial-to-trial RT variability predicts cognitive decline in old and very old age (Lövdén et al., 2007); and (d) perceptual speed decline in old age predicts decline in crystallized intelligence to a greater extent than vice versa (Ghisletta and Lindenberger, 2003).3.5Multigroup latent change score models: manifest groups, mixtures and intervention studiesThe LCSM provides a comprehensive framework to model both within-person change across time and between-person variability in change. A final, powerful extension that can be applied to any latent change score (or SEM) model is the possibility for multigroup comparisons. Parameter estimates of a LCSM are valid under the assumption that there is no model misspecification and the sample is drawn from a single, homogeneous population. In practice, however, our samples may be a mixture of participants from different populations (e.g., children and older adults; men and women, low vs. high SES). There are several ways to address sample heterogeneity depending on the assumptions we are willing to make and the strength of our theoretical reasoning concerning sample heterogeneity. First and foremost, approaches to model heterogeneity can be classified by whether heterogeneity is assumed to be observed or unobserved.When heterogeneity is observed in a confirmatory modelling approach, hypothesis testing is concerned with finding statistical evidence for difference in the key parameters of the LCSM. Cross-sectional analyses often use traditional methods such as (M)ANOVA’s to focus on simple parameters of interest, such as the mean scores on some outcome of interest. In a SEM context, it is relatively easy to compare any parameter of interest in a (dynamic) model across groups. To do so, one simply imposes equality constraints on the parameter of interest and compares the model where the parameter of interest is freely estimated to a constrained model as described above. Relatively sophisticated questions about changing relations between constructs, developmental dynamics and group differences can be addressed with this simple yet powerful test, with previous investigations comparing regression coefficients (e.g. the negative effect of relational bullying on friendships is stronger in boys than in girls, van Harmelen et al., 2016), or dynamic growth components (e.g. boys and girls show differential response dynamics following divorce, Malone et al., 2004). In cases where a large number of covariates are potentially relevant but we have no strong theories to guide us, more exploratory techniques such as SEM trees (Brandmaier et al., 2013) and SEM forests (Brandmaier et al., 2016) allows researchers to hierarchically split empirical data into homogeneous groups sharing similar data patterns, by recursively selecting optimal predictors of these differences from a potentially large set of candidates. The resulting tree structure reflects a set of subgroups with distinct model parameters, where the groups are derived in a data-driven way. Group divisions are often based on observed variables, but if heterogeneity is assumed to be unobserved, researchers may turn to latent mixture models (McLachlan and Peel, 2005, but for a cautionary note see Bauer, 2007).An often overlooked application of LCS and SEM models is in intervention studies (McArdle, 1994). We can treat grouping of participants into treatment and control groups in precisely the same way as traditional grouping variables such as gender or education, and compare all model parameter using likelihood ratio tests. For instance, Raz et al. (2013) showed less cerebellar shrinkage in a cognitive training intervention group than in controls, and Maass et al. (2015) using SEM to demonstrate correlated change in between fitness improvement and memory. By modelling time by group interaction in a SEM context, one can use multiple indicator latent change score models to derive error-free effect sizes of the treatment effect, by subtracting average latent change in control group from average latent change in the treatment group for latent constructs (e.g. Schmiedek et al., 2010, Schmiedek et al., 2014). Once researchers have decided on which model best matches their developmental hypothesis and is compatible with the available data, it is time to estimate and interpret the model.4Challenges and limitations4.1Model fit, model estimation and model comparisonOnce a model has been specified for a suitable dataset, a researcher will estimate the free parameters in the model. The most common approach to parameter estimation in SEM is maximum likelihood, under the assumption of multivariate normality. The extent to which this assumption is violated can bias results, although adjusted model fit indices have been developed to account for deviations from (multivariate) normality (e.g. Satorra-Bentler or Yuan-Bentler-scaled test statistics; Rosseel, 2012). Note that these methods only adjust fit indices, not standard errors, which may also be affected by deviations from (multivariate) normality – Various additional methods such as Huber-White standard errors can be used to address this challenge and are implemented in almost all SEM packages (including lavaan, see Rosseel (2012, p. 27) for more detail). Alternatively, other estimation strategies can be used to estimate non-continuous or non-normal outcomes (e.g., threshold models or weighted-least-squares estimators for ordinal data) but as a detailed investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this tutorial we refer the reader to additional resources (Kline, 2011, Olsson et al., 2000, Rosseel, 2012, Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003).A key intermediate step in longitudinal SEM in the case of measurement models (e.g. Fig. 3) is to provide evidence for measurement invariance, that is to ensure that the same latent construct (e.g. general intelligence) is measured in the same manner across time or across groups (Meredith, 1993, Millsap, 2011, Vandenberg and Lance, 2000, Wicherts et al., 2004). In other words, we want the relationship between levels of the latent variables and the observed scores to be equal across time, even when latent scores themselves are increasing or decreasing on average. Failing to establish measurement invariance can lead to incorrect conclusions about latent variables, their growth over time, and their relations to other variables (Ferrer et al., 2008). In longitudinal SEM, a series of increasingly strict tests (Widaman et al., 2010) can be applied to ensure measurement invariance. Conventionally, this is done by establishing equality constraints over time, by sequentially equating the factor loadings (λjt1 = λjt2), error terms (δjt1 = δjt2) and intercepts across time or groups. Such constraints can be shown graphically in model representations – For instance in Fig. 3, these equality constraints are shown by designating the same factor loading with a single label (e.g. λ1) or colour across loading (e.g. blue) across time points. Recent work shows that the CFI (comparative fit index, see for more detail below) is a practical way to test for measurement invariance across increasingly strict models created by imposing a specific sequence of model constraints (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002). If measurement invariance is violated, the extent to which inferences are affected and possible remedies using ‘partial measurement invariance’ are discussed in (Vandenberg and Lance, 2000).A key strength of estimation in SEM is the treatment of missing data (Enders, 2001). Assuming data is either Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) or Missing At Random (MAR), which means the missing data can only be dependent on variables also measured within the same dataset (e.g. if differences in dropout are gender specific, and gender is assessed), Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) can be used to estimate a model on the full dataset (including subjects with incomplete data) (Baraldi and Enders, 2010, Enders, 2001, Wothke, 2000). Using FIML for missing data (under multivariate normality) maximizes the utility of all existing data, decreases bias and increases statistical power compared to (for instance) omitting incomplete cases (‘complete case analysis’; Baraldi and Enders, 2010). In direct comparisons, FIML usually performs as well or better than alternative methods such as multiple imputation (MI) (Larsen, 2011, von Hippel, 2016). A practical benefit of FIML compared to MI is the stability of estimation across uses, whereas multiple imputation depends on stochastic sampling and will yield a (slightly) different estimate every time. Moreover, combining information across different imputations can be challenging, although this has been automated for SEM with lavaan via the auxiliary package ‘semTools’ (Jorgensen et al., 2015).Once model estimation has finished (which may take anywhere from fractions of a second to days), a wide range of model fit indices are available to assess model fit (Kline, 2011, Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003). Generally, these metrics quantify the deviation between the observed and implied covariance matrix. Model fit metrics include a simple test of deviation from perfect model fit (the chi square test), indices that compare the degree to which the proposed model better fits the data (e.g. the CFI and TLI) compared to some baseline model (which typically is a model in which there are no correlations between measurements; and good fit represents the degree to which covariation in the empirical data is reliably modelled), and measures that quantify some standardized measures of the deviation between the observed and implied covariance matrices (e.g. SRMR or the RMSEA). Fit indices can be affected by a range of model and data properties including sample size, measurement quality, estimation method, misspecification and more (Fan et al., 1999, McNeish et al., 2017, Moshagen and Erdfelder, 2016). Competing models can be compared using traditional likelihood ratio test if models are nested (Neale, 2000), or specialized version of the LRT for non-nested models (Merkle et al., 2016). Other approaches to model comparison include the use of model fit indices such as CFI and RMSEA (Usami et al., 2016), or information based metrics such as the AIC and BIC (Aho et al., 2014, Wagenmakers and Farrell, 2004). A relatively new question inspired by cognitive neuroscience will be how to best conduct model selection and model comparison in procedures such as voxelwise modelling from brain image data (Madhyastha et al., n.d.) which may require hundreds or thousands of model comparisons or extended measurement models of spatially correlated observations – This at present remains an open challenge.Debates concerning the optimal way to assess and interpret model fit, which thresholds to use or how to best compare models are wide ranging and beyond the scope of this tutorial, for further details see (Barrett, 2007, Fan et al., 1999, Hayduk et al., 2007, Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003, Steiger, 2007). Common advice includes reporting multiple (types of) fit indices to allow for a more holistic assessment such as reporting raw χ2, CFI and RMSEA (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003). Recommended sources for a wide range of (longitudinal) SEM topics include McArdle (2009), Newsom (2015), Hoyle (2014), Little (2013), Voelkle and Oud (2015), Driver et al. (2016) and Voelkle (2007), as well as the tutorials cited above. Other useful resources are SEM-oriented email groups such as SEMNET (http://www2.gsu.edu/∼mkteer/semnet.html) or package focused help groups (e.g. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lavaan).4.2Convergence and improper solutionsAlthough SEM in general and LCS in particular cover a broad and flexible range of models and techniques, these techniques have various limitations. Below we outline a subset of commonly faced challenges. After specifying an LCS model, researchers will use a particular estimation procedure, typically Maximum Likelihood, to provide estimates for the parameters in the model. However, in contrast to simpler methods such as t-tests and simple regressions, model estimation may fail to converge. Common causes of a failure to converge include small sample sizes, overly complex models, poor starting values, inappropriate estimators, large amounts of missing data, data input errors, or misspecified models (Fan et al., 1999, Jackson, 2007, Wothke, 1993). A particular challenge in the context of latent change score models (and closely related models such as linear mixed models) is that of estimating or constraining variances terms (close) to 0 (for instance, constraining the variance to 0 in the simplest univariate latent change score model will generally lead to non-convergence even if the change scores between T1 and T2 are identical across individuals). Classical estimation methods such as Maximum Likelihood have relatively high non-convergence rates in such scenarios, and non-convergence has often (erroneously) been interpreted as evidence that the model is necessarily inappropriate. Moreover, the likelihood ratio test may not behave appropriately in scenarios including such ‘boundary values’ (Stoel et al., 2006). One promising solution is Bayesian estimation, which has been suggested to have considerably less estimation problems (Eager and Roy, 2017, Merkle and Rosseel, 2015, Muthén and Asparouhov, 2012, Van Erp et al., 2017). Secondly, even if estimation does converge, model fit may be ‘improper’ in various ways. Such improper solutions may include negative variances, standardized estimates that (far) exceed 1 (sometimes referred to as ‘Heywood cases’, but see Jöreskog, 1999), or matrices that are ‘non-positive definite’ (Wothke, 1993). No unique cause underlies these problems, nor does a single solution exist that applies in all cases, but various remedies may help. These including providing plausible starting values for parameters to aid estimation, increasing sample sizes, using a different estimator, or constraining parameters to 0 or to (in)equality where appropriate – for example, variances which are estimated just below zero might be constrained to zero so that they remain within appropriate bounds. For further reading on challenges and solutions of model convergence and inappropriate solutions we recommend (Eager and Roy, 2017, Fan et al., 1999, Gerbing and Anderson, 1987, Wothke, 1993).4.3Power and sample sizeA challenge closely related to model fit and model comparison is that of statistical power and the associated question of sample size (Cohen, 1988). One often encounters rules of thumb (such as “one should have 20 subjects per SEM parameter”), which typically are misleading and never capture the full story. Here, we advise against such heuristics. When designing a longitudinal study, there are many more design decisions that directly affect statistical power, such as indicator reliability, true effect size, or the number and spacing of measurement occasions (Brandmaier et al., 2015), and strategies exist to improve power without necessarily increasing sample size (Hansen and Collins, 1994). Longitudinal models have successfully been fit to as few as 22 subjects (Curran et al., 2010), but as for all statistical approaches, larger sample sizes will generally lead to more robust inferences. Although factors determining statistical power in latent growth models are reasonably well understood (Hertzog et al., 2006, Hertzog et al., 2008, Oertzen et al., 2010, Rast and Hofer, 2014, von Oertzen and Brandmaier, 2013, von Oertzen et al., 2015), we know of no empirical simulation studies that may serve as guidelines for the power of (bivariate) LCSM. Currently, statistical power for a specific LCSM design (including a hypothesized true effect and sample size) can be approximated mathematically (Satorra and Saris, 1985) or by computer-intensive simulation (Muthén and Muthén, 2002). For a more general approach to the question of model selection, model comparison and parameter recovery we have included a flexible, general script that can allow users to generate a dataset under known conditions from a given model, and fit one or more models to this dataset3. This simple approach should allow anyone to examine compare parameter recovery, convergence rates, statistical power, model selection and model fit under a range of effect sizes, sample sizes and missingness to facilitate appropriate study planning.4.4Inference and causalityOnce model convergence and adequate model fit are obtained, the most daunting step is that of (causal) inference: What may and may not be concluded based on the results? One goal of SEM is to test predictions derived from causal hypotheses about the process that generated the data, represented as a model. That is, although SEM (nor any other correlation-based technique) cannot directly demonstrate causality or causal processes, it can be used as a statistical tool for deriving model-based predictions of causal hypotheses, and examine the extent to which the data disconfirms these hypotheses (Bollen and Diamantopoulos, 2015, Pearl, 2000). However, inferring causality is, unsurprisingly, non-trivial. A first and most fundamental challenge, not specific to SEM, is that of model equivalence, known in philosophy of science as the ‘the underdetermination of theory by data’ (e.g. Newton-Smith and Lukes, 1978). In the context of SEM, it has been shown formally that any observed data pattern is compatible with many different data generating mechanisms (Raykov and Penev, 1999). In other words, even if a model fits well in a sufficiently large dataset, that in and of itself is not conclusive evidence for the (causal) hypotheses posited by the model. Moreover, in a longitudinal context, modelling choices and omitted variables can affect, and even spuriously invert, causal direction and temporal ordering (Usami et al., 2016) as well as the magnitude (Voelkle and Oud, 2015) of effects. Although recent years have seen a consistent trend away from causal language with recommendations to move away from the term ‘causal modelling’ as shorthand for SEM (Kline, 2011), for a spirited defence as well as a historically informed overview of the causal history and foundations of SEM, see Pearl (2012). The most commonly accepted solution is that model inferences, including causality, should come from a convergence of robust empirical evidence guided by theoretical motivations, and ideally be validated by interventions whenever possible.Finally, although SEM is commonly used as a technique to test whether data is (provisionally) compatible with a particular (causal) hypothesis, in practice SEM spans a range of approaches from almost entirely exploratory to confirmatory. In the context of LCS models, non-trivial misfit may be amended by model re-specification to achieve acceptable fit. One approach to improve model fit is the examination of ‘modification indices’ – The expected improvement in model fit if a currently constrained parameter was freely estimated. As this is generally purely data-driven, this practice may adversely affect interpretability and generalization to independent datasets, so should be exercised with caution (MacCallum et al., 1992). Other approaches include the addition of cross-loadings, the elimination of non-significant structural paths, constraining or equating parameters or the exclusion of poorly performing measurement indicators. All of those changes may be defensible, but researchers should be explicit about any modifications that were made purely to improve model fit, so as to be able to assess the evidence in favour of the ‘final’ model appropriately (Bentler, 2007, MacCallum et al., 1992).4.5LCS versus alternative modelsStructural equation modelling is an extremely general framework to study differences and change, and shares foundations with other analytic approaches. Previous work has shown similarities and even equivalences with other analytical traditions such as multilevel- and linear mixed modelling (Bauer, 2003, Curran, 2003, Rovine and Molenaar, 2001). However, even when models are mathematically equivalent in principle, they may still diverge in practical terms, such as ease of model specification and common defaults – McNeish and Matta (2017) examine in which situations linear mixed models versus SEM approaches are a better choice. An overarching treatment by Voelkle (Voelkle, 2007) has shown how a wide variety of analytical techniques ranging from t-tests to MANOVAs can be (re)written as special cases of the latent growth curve model (which is itself a special case of the latent change score model). For instance, (Coman et al., 2013) shows how a basic LCS is a special case of the paired t-test. Similarly, simple forms of the bivariate latent change score model can be rewritten as a special case of a cross-lagged panel model, namely the recently proposed random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (Hamaker et al., 2015), and the autoregressive cross-lagged factor model is equivalent to a latent change score model when slope factor scores are equivalent across individuals (Usami et al., 2016).Grimm (2007) used three popular longitudinal models, the bivariate latent growth curve model, the latent growth curve with a time-varying covariate, and the bivariate dual change score growth model, to examine the same dataset concerning the relation between depression and academic achievement. Although the three models yielded different results, Grimm (2007) illustrates how each of the three approaches answer slightly different developmental questions, illustrating the importance of McArdle’s question posed at the beginning of this article: ‘When thinking about any repeated measures analysis it is best to ask first, what is your model for change?’ (McArdle, 2009, p. 579). Alternative longitudinal SEM approaches that address specific questions with differing strengths and weaknesses include the autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) model (Bollen and Curran, 2004), survival models (Newsom, 2015, chapter 12), continuous time models (Driver et al., 2016), simplex models (Newsom, 2015), the incorporation of definition variables (Mehta and West, 2000), regime switching LCS models (Chow et al., 2013), latent trait-state models (Steyer et al., 1999), and extensions of latent curve models including structured residuals and time-varying covariates (Curran et al., 2014). For a general introduction to longitudinal SEM approaches we recommend the recent book by Newsom (2015).Direct comparisons of LCS models to competing models exist but are relatively rare. Usami et al. (2016) compared the LCS to the auto-regressive cross-lagged factor (ARCL) model, and showed lower levels of bias in the parameter estimates of the LCS model, depending on the number of time points and sample size, but slightly more power for the ARCL model (due to decreased standard errors). Notably, they observed that model selection was best when using the less conventional approach of comparison model fit indices (RMSEA and CFI) as opposed to likelihood ratio tests or information indices. Using simulation studies, McArdle and Hamagami (2001a) compared the bivariate dual change score model to a Multilevel Change Score Regression Model under a range of known data generating processes. They showed that the multilevel regression model performed adequately only under a range of restrictive conditions including no missing data, an absence of error terms and no bivariate coupling. The bivariate dual change score model on the other hand was able to accurately recover parameter estimates under a range of missingness conditions, even up to the extreme case of cross-sectional data (i.e. one timepoint per individual), as long as data was Missing Completely at Random (p. 233), illustrating the robustness and flexibility of LCS models. Compared to simpler, more traditional techniques LCS and related models more natural accommodate a range of commonly encountered research challenges, including missing data, unequal spacing, time-varying covariates, and latent and manifest group comparisons which may aid in the nature, direction and precision of statistical inferences in studying dynamic processes (Curran et al., 2010). Many developmental hypotheses can be cast as a special case of the LCS, but researchers should always carefully consider whether a given model best captures their central developmental hypotheses compared to other analytical approaches.5Fitting latent change score models using open source softwareA wide array of tools exist to fit longitudinal SEM models, ranging from modules within popular statistical tools (e.g., AMOS within SPSS; Arbuckle, 2010) to dedicated SEM software (e.g., Mplus; Muthén and Muthén, 2005). We focus on two freely available tools: The package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) within R and a standalone, GUI-based tool Ωnyx (von Oertzen et al., 2015).5.1LavaanR (R Development Core Team, 2016) is a powerful programming language with a rapidly growing user community dedicated to data analysis and visualisation. Several excellent interactive introductions to R exist, including http://tryr.codeschool.com/ or http://swirlstats.com/. The core strength of R is the wide range of packages dedicated to addressing specific challenges (more than 10,000 as of February 2017), implementing statistical techniques, visualisation and more. Several packages dedicated to SEM exist, including OpenMx (Boker et al., 2011) which allows for a high degree of model specification flexibility, but relatively complex syntax, the sem package (Fox, 2006), Bayesian SEM (blavaan, Merkle and Rosseel, 2015), regularized SEM for complex models (regsem, Jacobucci et al., 2016) and even a new package dedicated specifically to specific subtypes of longitudinal SEM (RAMpath, Zhang et al., 2015).We will focus on lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) as this is a highly popular and versatile tool for modelling various structural equation models, including longitudinal models. Lavaan syntax consists of multiple lines specifying relations among variables using different operators for e.g. factor loadings (‘=∼’), regressions (‘∼’), (co)variances (‘∼∼’), and means or intercepts (‘∼1′). In the syntax below we specify a simple, univariate latent change score model, estimating five key parameters (in bold).#Fit the Univariate Latent Change Score model in Lavaan to simulated dataLCS<-'# Specify the model nameCOG2 ∼ 1*COG1# This parameter regresses COG2 perfectly on COG1dCOG1 =∼ 1*COG2# This defines the latent change score factor as measured perfectly by COG2dCOG1 ∼1# This estimates the conditional mean of the change scoreCOG1 ∼ 1# This estimates the mean of COG1COG2 ∼ θ*1# This constrains the intercept of COG2 to θdCOG1 ∼∼ dCOG1# This estimates the conditional variance of the change scoresCOG1 ∼∼ COG1# This estimates the variance of the COG1COG2 ∼∼ θ*COG2# This fixes the variance of the COG2 to θdCOG1∼COG1# This estimates the self-feedback parameterfitLCS <- lavaan(LCS, data = simdatLCS,estimator = 'mlr',fixed.x = FALSE,missing = 'fiml')## this fits the modelsummary(fitLCS, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)## this reports model fitLavaan example syntax. Comments in R are preceded by #. Key LCS parameters are boldfaced.The lavaan syntax and simulated data for all five model types discussed above is available online https://osf.io/4bpmq/files/. These scripts install and load the relevant packages if needed, simulate data according to given set of parameter values, visualize raw data and fit the model. For a simulated data object called ‘simdatLCS’, the syntax above fits a simple Univariate Latent Change Score model with a Yuan-Bentler correction for non-normality (‘estimator=’mlr’), and full information maximum likelihood to deal with missing data (‘missing=’fiml’). In Appendix A we provide a step-by-step instruction to fit models using R or Ωnyx (see below).5.2ΩnyxAlthough syntax-centred methods for SEM are most common, new users may prefer a more visual, path model based approach (e.g. AMOS, Arbuckle, 2010). One powerful tool is Ωnyx (von Oertzen et al., 2015), a freely available graphical modelling software for creating and estimating various structural equation models. At the time of writing, we used the most recent public version (Ωnyx 1.0-972), available from http://onyx.brandmaier.de/. Ωnyx provides a purely graphical modelling environment without a model syntax level, that is, models are simply drawn as path diagrams. As soon as datasets are loaded within a model, estimation starts on-the-fly and parameter estimates will be directly shown in the model diagram. In addition to its easy-to-use interface, a particular strength of Ωnyx is its capability of generating model syntax for other programs, such as Lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) OpenMx (Boker et al., 2011), or Mplus Muthén and Muthén, 2005). The focus on the graphical interface makes Ωnyx especially useful for beginners who want to get a basic comprehension of SEM, but also for more advanced users who either want to transition to other SEM programs or need to produce diagrams for presentations or manuscripts. Finally, Ωnyx provides template models for commonly used models, reducing time needed to set up standard models to a minimum. Here, we will give a brief introduction on how the Ωnyx graphical user interface works.The idea behind Ωnyx is a little different to typical editors. The main menu is virtually empty (with the exception of basic load and save functions) and there is neither a tool ribbon (e.g., as in Microsoft Word) or a toolbox (e.g., as in Adobe Photoshop) to access functions. Instead, Ωnyx relies heavily on context-menus that are accessible with right mouse-clicks. A double-click performs a context-specific default action. For example, when Ωnyx is started, the empty Ωnyx desktop is shown. A right-click on the desktop opens a new model frame, which is a container for a SEM. Alternatively, a double-click on the desktop creates a model frame (see Fig. 6 for an example of the interface). In Appendix A, we provide a step by step guide to fitting an existing model to data within Ωnyx, as well as a step-by-step explanation how to specify a new model from scratch.Fig. 6Ωnyx interface.Fig. 65.3Developing intuitions about change using an interactive shiny appAbove we explained the basics of LCS models, including graphical representations. Although these examples are relatively easy to understand, one challenge with complex dynamic models is that it can be hard to intuit what the consequences of changes in various parameters might be. To ameliorate this problem, we have built an interactive online tool using the R package Shiny (Chang et al., 2016). This tool allows researchers to modify the key parameters of interest for three key models (univariate latent change score, bivariate latent change score, and bivariate dual change score) in an interactive fashion and examine the consequences for the observed scores. Fig. 7 illustrates our shiny interface, which can be found at http://brandmaier.de/shiny/sample-apps/SimLCS_app/.4 The drop-down menu at the top can be used to select one of three models, and the sliders can be used to tweak individual parameters. Changing the key parameters causes the underlying simulation to be modified on the fly, and the panels at the bottom visualize the raw data simulated. The underlying code can easily be accessed and modified, such that researchers can tailor our code to their specific research design. Our hope is that this tool will prove useful in developing intuitions about dynamic co-occurring processes of development and change.Fig. 7Shiny interface. At the top users can select from three different latent change score models (Univariate, bivariate or dual). At the left, users can modify key parameters and select ‘generate data’ to simulate data with a given parametrisation. On the right, the raw data as well as the path model will shown. This allows users to form an intuition of the effect of dynamic coupling. For instance, it can illustrate that even in the absence of significant changes within a domain, a coupling parameter from another domain can cause significant increases or decreases over time.Fig. 76ExamplesBelow we illustrate the flexibility of Latent Change Score modelling by describing two empirical examples. First, we describe cognitive (processing speed) and neural (white matter fractional anisotropy) changes from a training intervention study in younger and older adults. Second, we describe group differences in structural changes (i.e. cortical thinning) in a developmental study of (late) adolescents aged 14–24. These applications illustrate the types of questions naturally accommodated by latent change score models.6.1Correlated change in high intensity training intervention: the COGITO sampleThe first illustration comes from data on the COGITO project (Schmiedek et al., 2014), a high-intensity (100 day) training intervention with pre and post-tests cognitive scores for 204 adults: 101 young (age M = 25.11, SD = 2.7, range = 20–31) and 103 old (age M = 70.78, SD = 4.15, range = 64–80).We examine changes between pre- and post-test scores on a latent variable of processing speed, measured by three standardized tests from the Berlin Intelligence Structure test measured on two occasions (see Schmiedek et al. (2010) for more details). The neural measure of interest is fractional anisotropy in the sensory subregion of the Corpus Callosum (see Lövdén et al., 2010 for more details – note in our exploratory analysis this subregion gave the most stable results and so it was used for our illustration). Longitudinal neuroimaging data was available for a subset of 32 people (20 younger, 12 older adults). We fit the model to the entire sample using Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation, maximizing the use of our sample and decreasing bias compared to complete case analysis. However, the neural parameters should be interpreted with a level of caution commensurate to the modest sample size. See Lövdén et al. (2014) for further discussion regarding the benefits of FIML in such a context and Enders (2001) for more general discussion of FIML.First, we test a multiple indicator univariate latent change score model (the same type of model as shown in Fig. 3). This univariate (only processing speed) multiple indicator (a latent variable of processing speed is specified) latent change score model fits the data well: χ2(12) = 15.052, P = 0.239, RMSEA = 0.035 [0.000 0.084], CFI = 0.996, SRMR=0.028, Yuan-Bentler scaling factor = 0.969. Inspection of key parameters shows that scores increased between pre- and post-test (the intercept of the change factor = 0.224, se = 0.031, Z = 7.24), there were significant individual differences in gains (variance parameter for the latent change score: est = 0.120, se = 0.019, Z = 6.5, but the rate of improvement did not depend on the starting point: est = −0.069, se = 0.054, Z = −1.32). Next, we include a neural measure, namely Fractional Anisotropy in the sensory region of the Corpus Callosum measured pre- and post-test, to fit a bivariate (neural and behaviour) multiple indicator (we include a measurement model) latent change score model shown in Fig. 8.Fig. 8COGITO correlated change in processing speed and white matter plasticity. The panels on the left show the fitted model, parameter estimates and standard errors. The latent variable Processing Speed is measured by three subtests of the Berlin Intelligence Structure test (BIS1-BIS3) measured before (pre) and after (post) an intensive training intervention (see Schmiedek et al., 2010). Observed variable means and variance estimates are omitted for visual clarity. The panels on the right show the raw scores changing across two occasions. The raw scores are plotted on separate panels to accommodate the age gap, but the model is estimated for the population as a whole.Fig. 8We next test the evidence for four possible brain-behaviour relationships: Covariance (are scores on processing speed at T1 correlated with white matter structure at T1?), neural measures as leading variable (do differences in white matter integrity at T1 affect the rate of cognitive training gains?), cognition as leading variable (do processing speed scores at T1 predict degree of white matter plasticity between T1 and T2?) and/or correlated change (is the degree of improvement in the cognitive domain correlated with the degree of white matter change in individuals?). Fig. 8 shows the full model, as well as the changes in processing speed factor scores (top right) and fractional anisotropy (bottom right) (note we artificially expanded the interval between testing intervals for visual clarity). First, we find that model fit is good: χ2(20) = 24.773, P = 0.21, RMSEA = 0.034 [90% CI: 0.000 0.072], CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.083, Yuan-Bentler scaling factor = 1.021. The full model is shown in Fig. 8. Inspection of the four parameters of interest, reflecting the four possible brain-behaviour relationships outlined above, shows evidence (only) for correlated change. In other words, those with greater gains in processing speed were, on average, those with less positive change in fractional anisotropy after taking into account the other dynamic parameters (est = −0.006, se = 0.002, z = −2.631). Although counterintuitive, a similar pattern was also observed in Bender et al. (2015) who observed negative correlation between age-related declines in episodic memory and white matter integrity, such that a greater decrease in fractional anisotropy was associated with greater improvement in episodic memory (whereas at T1 FA and episodic memory were positively correlated). This illustration shows how LCS models can be used to simultaneously estimate four rather distinct brain-behaviour relationships over time.6.2Multigroup analysis of prefrontal structural change in late adolescence: the NSPN cohortAs the example in the Cogito sample shows, LCS offers a simple and powerful way to test distinct dynamic pathways within a single LCS model. However, investigations in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience are often concerned with differences between groups (e.g. gender, treatment vs. controls, psychopathology vs. healthy controls, low vs high SES etc.). Such questions are best addressed by means of multigroup modelling. Here we illustrate a multigroup model to compare structural changes in a group of adolescents. Data for this is drawn from the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN), a cohort that studies development in adolescents (see also Kiddle et al., 2017, Kievit et al., 2017, Whitaker et al., 2016) Here we illustrate a multigroup model to compare structural brain change in a group of adolescents. Previous work suggests differences in the temporal development of the frontal cortex, with boys generally maturing later than girls (Giedd et al., 2012, Ziegler et al., 2017), possibly as a consequence of differences in sensitivity to hormone levels (Bramen et al., 2012).For our analysis, we focus on volumetric changes in the frontal pole. This region is part of the frontal lobe, which is often discussed with respect to the speed of maturational changes and its purported role in controlling higher cognitive functions and risk taking behaviour (e.g. Crone and Dahl, 2012, Johnson, 2011, Mills et al., 2014).Our sample consisted of 176 individuals, mean age = 18.84, range 14.3–24.9, 82 girls, scanned on two occasions (average interval: M = 1.24 years, SD = 0.33 years). We fit a multiple indicator univariate latent change score model, with volume of the frontal pole (FP) using the neuromorphometrics atlas as the key variable (see Fig. 9D for an illustration). Our measurement model consisted of volumetric estimates of the left and right FP measured on two occasions (for more details on the structural processing pipeline, see Appendix B). We can use the framework of multigroup models to investigate whether there is evidence for differences between the two groups in the key parameters of interest. The four parameters of interest are the mean of the frontal factor (reflecting mean volumes at T1), the intercept of the change factor (reflecting the rate of change), the variance of the latent change scores (reflecting individual differences in rates of FP change) and the covariance between FP at T1 and rate of FP change. To do so, we employ the method of equality constrained Likelihood Ratio tests, by comparing a model where some parameter of interest is constrained to be the same across the two groups with a model where the parameter is allowed to be free. The difference in model fit under the null hypothesis is chi-square distributed with a df equivalent to the difference in numbers of parameters being constrained. In other words, if a parameter of interest is the same (or highly similar) between two groups, the chi-square test will fail to be rejected, suggesting the more parsimonious model is sufficient.Fig. 9NSPN: Differential variability in frontal lobe thinning. Panel A shows longitudinal development in frontal structure. Panel B shows the model fit for the best model. Where parameters are different between groups we show male estimates in blue (top parameter), female in red (bottom parameter). Panel C shows the AIC and BIC of the free versus constrained models – in all cases only one parameter is constrained to equality and compared to the ‘all free’ model. Panel D shows the left and right frontal poles of the neuromorphometrics atlas used in our analysis. See Appendix B for more details on the imaging pipeline. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 9First, we fit a model where all measurement model parameters (constraining all factor loadings and residual (co)variances) are constrained to be equal across males and females, but all other parameters are free to vary between the sexes. This model fit the data well: χ2(9) = 8.929, P = 0.44, RMSEA = 0.00 [0.000 0.120], CFI = 1, SRMR = 0.021, Yuan-Bentler scaling factor = 0.983. Next, we explored which (if any) of the four parameters above differed between the sexes. If a parameter is different between the groups, constraining it to be equal should result in a significant decrease in model fit. Using the likelihood ratio test, we observe significant decreases in model fit by constraining the mean of frontal lobe volume at T1 to be equal across the sexes (χ2Δ = 38.01, dfΔ = 2, p = <0.0001). Inspection of parameter estimates shows, unsurprisingly, greater FP volume in males, compatible with either larger brains, delayed cortical thinning, or a combination of the two. Contrary to expectations, constraining the intercept of the change scores did not lead to a significant decrease in fit (χ2Δ = 0.31889, dfΔ = 2, p = 0.57), indicating an absence of reliable differences in cortical thinning. However, constraining the variance of change scores to be equal did result in a significant drop in fit (χ2Δ = 49.319, dfΔ = 2, p = <0.0001), with males showing greater individual differences in rates of thinning than females see also Ritchie et al., (2017). Finally, constraining the covariance between frontal volume and change scores also led to a drop in model fit, with males showing a stronger (negative) association between volume at T1 and rate of change (compatible with the hypotheses of delayed development in males). Fig. 9 shows the temporal development of FP structure between sexes, information based model comparison and parameter estimates for the full model (with different estimates for males and females where required).Together, this suggests that there are considerable differences in frontal development between males and females in (late) adolescence: Although males and females show similar rates of cortical thinning, males show greater initial volume, greater individual differences in thinning and a stronger association between initial volume and rate of thinning. Notably, the parameters where the evidence for sex differences is strongest (e.g. variance and covariance in change scores) are not parameters often studied using conventional techniques such as paired t-tests (other than as a statistical assumption such as equality of variances). Conversely, the parameter that would be the key focus with traditional techniques (i.e. group differences in change scores) does not show differences.7ConclusionIn this tutorial, we introduce the powerful framework of Latent Change Score modelling whose deployment can be an invaluable aid for developmental cognitive neuroscience. It is our hope that more widespread employment of these powerful techniques will aid the developmental cognitive neuroscientific community. Adopting the statistical techniques we outline in tandem with the more widespread availability of large, longitudinal, cohorts of developing adolescents will allow researchers to more fully address questions of interest, as well as inspire new questions and approaches. The approach we outline puts renewed emphasis on the value of longitudinal over cross-sectional data in addressing developmental questions.Conflict of interestE.T.B. is employed half-time by the University of Cambridge and half-time by GlaxoSmithKline; he holds stock in GlaxoSmithKline.FundingRAK is supported by the Sir Henry Wellcome Trust (grant number 107392/Z/15/Z) and the UK Medical Research Council Programme (MC-A060-5PR61).

Below we outline how to specify and fit models using lavaan and R.1Analyse data using R and lavaan–Install R (https://cran.r-project.org/)–Install Rstudio (recommended) (https://www.rstudio.com/)–Open the relevant lavaan file (e.g. ‘1_ULCS.R’)–Install the appropriate packages by uncommenting (e.g. lines 17–19 in 1_ULCS.R)–Select and run lines 30–60 to create a simulated dataset with given parameters–Select and run lines 85–92 to visualize the raw data–Select and run lines 65–80 to fit the latent change score model–Run line 81 to examine model fit and parameters–If so desired, modify the parameters in lines 47–53 to examine the consequences for the raw data and model fit2Fit a model to existing dataset using Ωnyx3Creating a new model using ΩnyxTo create variables in the model, right-click on the model frame and choose ‘add variable’ to add an observed, latent or constant variable. Alternatively, users can double-click on the model frame to create an observed variable. Existing variables can be moved by left-dragging (press left mouse button and move mouse while button pressed). Double-clicking while holding down the SHIFT button creates a latent variable. Regression paths (single headed) are drawn by right drags, that is, by pressing the right mouse button on a variable and releasing the button only when the mouse was moved to a second variable. Covariance paths (double headed) are drawn by holding SHIFT while releasing a path. Variance paths are created by creating a covariance path from a variable to itself. By default, path values are fixed to one. Paths values can be changed either by right-clicking a path and entering a new value in the context menu or by moving the mouse over a path and directly typing the desired value. Path can be defined to represent a freely estimated parameter by right-clicking a path and choosing “Free Parameter”. Using the context menu, parameters can be renamed and starting values can be given. Observed variables can be either associated with a data column or not. This is indicated by observed variables either having a grey box (not linked) or a black box (linked data). To link a variable with data, one can load a dataset from an existing file and simply drag the variables onto the Ωnyx representation.As an alternative to the manual creation of a change score model, Ωnyx provides a wizard for quick model specification, even for more advanced models. Users can right-click on the Ωnyx desktop and choose, among other models, ‘Create new LGCM’ (for a linear growth curve model) or ‘Create new DCSM’ (for a dual change score model), which can then be modified as desired. The LCSM wizard allows you to specify the number of time points. Once the model is specified, users can simply drag and drop data (e.g. columns in a .csv file) from an existing data file onto the appropriate observed variables in the model by selecting ‘load data’ from the main drop-down menu. As soon as variables are added the program starts estimation.Advanced features of ΩnyxAs noted before, Ωnyx provides various functions to export models to other SEM programs. For example, if users wish to use more complicated modelling approaches (e.g., ordinal outcomes, non-linear constraints), Ωnyx can quickly create a graphical model specification which then can be exported to another SEM program that allows greater flexibility in modelling. Ωnyx also exports diagrams as bitmap graphics (JPG, PNG) or vector graphics (PDF, EPS) and even creates LaTeX-representations of diagrams based on the tikz package. Ωnyx comes with different visual style templates that can be applied to a model with a single click. To choose among styles, right-click on a model frame and choose Customize Model → Apply Diagram Style, or hit CTRL+L to cycle through styles in the active model frame. Ωnyx may be used to simulate data from the model-implied means and covariance matrix. To this end, choose “Simulation-> Start Simulation” in the context menu of a model frame. Ωnyx allows parameter names to be defined in a pseudo LaTeX input style, which allows users to use greek symbols (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma,…), subscripts (e.g., epsilon_i) and superscripts (e.g., sigma^2).Appendix BStructural Imaging and Map GenerationBrain scans were acquired using the MPM protocol (Weiskopf et al., 2013) on three 3T whole-body MRI systems (Magnetom TIM Trio; VB17 software version; Siemens Healthcare) located in Cambridge and London. Between-site reliability of MRI procedures was assessed in a pilot study scanning five healthy volunteers at each site. The between-site bias was found to be less than 3% and the between-site coefficient of variation was less than 8% for both longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and MT parameters (Weiskopf et al., 2013) Isotropic 1 mm MT images were quantified in Matlab (2014b, The MathWorks, Inc.) using SPM12 r6685 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), the Voxel-Based Quantification (VBQ) toolbox for SPM (Callaghan et al., 2014) and custom made tools.Longitudinal Image Processing and Feature ExtractionAll further image processing steps of MT maps were performed in SPM12. Longitudinal morphometry was used to assess macroscopic brain maturational changes. Since longitudinal imaging is prone to artefacts due to registration inconsistency, scanner inconsistencies and age-related deformations of the brains, it requires sophisticated processing pipelines in order to detect the changes of interest and achieve unbiased results.First, we applied symmetric diffeomorphic registration for longitudinal MRI (Ashburner and Ridgway, 2012) combining non-linear diffeomorphic and rigid-body registration and correction for intensity inhomogeneity artefacts. The optimization is realized within one integrated generative model and provides consistent estimates of within-subject brain deformations over the study period. The registration model also creates a midpoint image for each subject and the corresponding deformation fields for every individual scan.Second, we applied SPM12’s Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT, r955, Structural Imaging Group, http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat12/) segmentation to each subject's midpoint image, which assumes every voxel to be drawn from an unknown mixture of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Earlier results showed that MT maps are highly suitable for automated segmentation in multi-subject morphometric studies, showing improved GM tissue contrast in subcortical structures (Helms et al., 2009). This applied segmentation procedure contains partial volume estimation (PVE) to account for mixed voxels with two tissue types (Tohka et al., 2004). The CAT algorithm is based on an adaptive maximum a posteriori (AMAP) approach (Rajapakse et al., 1997) and subsequent application of a hidden Markov random field model (Cuadra et al., 2005). Importantly, the applied AMAP estimation does not rely on tissue priors, which overcomes potential bias due to the application of inappropriate tissue priors in young maturing subjects with different to adult brain anatomy.Third, nonlinear template generation and image registration was performed on the individual midpoint GM and WM tissue maps using DARTEL registration and the template was registered to MNI space using an affine transform (Ashburner, 2007). Consecutively longitudinal normalised tissue segments from all subjects and time-points were modulated by Jacobian determinants accounting for local tissue volume differences across subjects and within-subject changes over time. In order to detect stronger deviations due to potential segmentation or normalization errors, we included a quality check using covariance-based sample inhomogeneity measures implemented in the CAT toolbox to exclude subjects with extremal values and/or severe artefacts.Fourth, neuromorphometrics atlas was used to assess gray matter density in the bilateral frontal poles after Gaussian smoothing with 6 mm full width at half maximum. The atlas was based on maximum probability tissue labels derived in the MICCAI 2012 Grand Challenge and Workshop on Multi-Atlas Labeling with data originating from the OASIS project (http://www.oasis-brains.org/) and the atlas provided by Neuromorphometrics, Inc. (http://Neuromorphometrics.com/) under academic subscription.All longitudinal features for subsequent structural equation modelling were obtained using the above steps. Since common processing pipelines of longitudinal and cross-sectional data is different, this can introduce biases (Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2013). We initially focussed on the largest fully longitudinally processed subsample of the NSPN dataset available, with 202 subjects having at least 2 scans per person. After rigorous quality control of all processed imaging data, scans from 26 subjects had to be discarded due to artefacts, resulting in a finally analyzed brain features from 373 scans from 176 subjects (2.12 scans/person). Although a small subset of individuals had a third intermediate scan, for modelling purposes here we use only the first and last scan.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Delia Fuhrmann, Janne Adolf, Rasmus Berggren and Stuart Ritchie for comments on a previous draft of this manuscript, as well as readers of our preprint who reached out with valuable suggestions for improvement.1It is worth noting that such hypotheses of temporal precedence in measurable properties do not imply a dualist perspective on mental and physical processes (cf. Kievit et al., 2011). They do suggest scientifically relevant distinctions can be made with implications for interpretation, the likely consequences of interventions and early detection of non-typical development.2Although it should be noted that SEM software packages can vary in their default model specifications, so users should always be aware of these modelling assumptions3https://osf.io/4bpmq/?view_.4Note: some firewalls block the app. A zipped folder that contains all scripts and can be run locally is available on https://osf.io/4bpmq/files/."

This has particular relevance for mental health disorders where a failure to understand these links might hinder the development of better diagnostic approaches and therapeutics. Here, we investigated this question in 306 adolescents and young adults (14–24 y, 25 clinically depressed) using a multivariate statistical framework, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). By linking individual functional brain connectivity profiles to self-report questionnaires, IQ and demographic data we identified two distinct modes of covariation. The first mode mapped onto an externalization/internalization axis and showed a strong association with sex. The second mode mapped onto a well-being/distress axis independent of sex. Interestingly, both modes showed an association with age. Crucially, the changes in functional brain connectivity associated with changes in these phenotypes showed marked developmental effects. The findings point to a role for the default mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks in psychopathology and depression.Subject termsDepressionComputer scienceWellcome Trust (reference: WT102845/Z/13/Z)Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (reference: SFRH/BD/120640/2016)UCLH Biomedical Research CouncilFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (reference: SFRH/BD/88345/2012)MRC Skills Development Fellowship (reference: MR/S007806/1)Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (reference: 095844)Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (reference: 095844) National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator Award (reference: NF-SI-0514-10157) NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North ThamesWelcome Trust (reference: WT102845/Z/13/Z)issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2019IntroductionAdolescence and early adulthood are periods of high risk for onset of many psychiatric disorders1,2, with up to a fifth of 18 to 25 year olds seeking professional help for psychological distress3. Despite this there are, as yet, no biological measures that inform early diagnosis and treatment. Neuroimaging techniques, especially functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)4, enable researchers to relate biological measures, such as patterns of functional brain connectivity, to the continuum of healthy to pathological states5. Here, we applied these techniques to uniquely identify underlying dimensions of brain-behaviour variation during a key developmental period.Multivariate statistical methods6, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA)7, allow an investigation of links between multiple sets of measures, such as brain imaging and behavioural data, collected from the same individuals. Recently, an emerging number of studies report links between individual patterns of functional brain connectivity and item-level measures of behaviour and mental symptoms8–11. To the best of our knowledge no study has investigated this relationship in adolescents and young people, including those with clinically diagnosed mental health problems.In the current study, we exploited resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) and extensive item-level self-report questionnaire data, IQ and demographic information (that we refer as ‘behavioural data’ for simplicity) to investigate relationships between individual patterns of functional brain connectivity and individual sets of psychometrics/IQ/demographics. We used a sample of 281 healthy and 25 clinically depressed subjects, comprising adolescents and young adults (14–24 y, 165 females) from the NeuroScience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) study12.All 306 subjects completed self-report questionnaires assessing well-being, affective symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, compulsivity, self-esteem, self-harm, personality characteristics, psychotic spectrum symptoms, substance use, relations with peers and family and experience of trauma. These item-level measures were supplemented with measures of subjects’ fluid and crystallized intelligence as well as additional demographic information (age, gender and socioeconomic deprivation index) amounting to a total of 364 behavioural (i.e. psychometrics/IQ/demographics) measures for each subject.We acquired anatomical MRI scans and approximately 11 minutes of rsfMRI from the 306 subjects, which  were then pre-processed as described in Methods. From the rsfMRI data, we extracted averaged time-series from 348 brain regions using subcortical regions from Freesurfer13 and the multi-modal parcellation of the Human Connectome Project (HCP)14. We then estimated functional brain connectivity for each individual using full correlation (Pearson-correlation) between all pairs of regional time-series. This resulted in a single connectivity profile (348 × 347 regions, i.e. 60378 connections) for each subject.We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to investigate the relationships between brain connectivity and behaviour profiles across individuals. CCA is a multivariate analysis technique, which seeks maximal correlations between linear combinations of two or more sources of data (e.g. brain connectivity and behavioural data). To reduce the high dimensionality of both brain and behavioural data (60378 and 364 variables, respectively) we applied principal component analysis (PCA). We then performed a CCA resulting in pairs of canonical variates, which define modes of covariation between linear combinations of brain connectivity and behaviour profiles (in short ‘CCA modes’). On these canonical variates, subjects are represented by brain and behaviour scores, which describe the subject specific loadings in each CCA mode. We used a permutation approach15 to estimate both the optimal number of PCA components and the statistical significance of the CCA modes. Finally, we applied CCA embedded in a multiple hold-out framework16 to investigate the generalizability of the model, i.e. to assess whether the CCA mode represent associations that can be found on new data.Given the age range of our sample, we expected a strong age (or developmental) effect on the brain-behaviour modes of covariation. We suspected that variation in these modes might be related to the presence of depression, given that our sample also included clinically depressed subjects. Finally, we hypothesized that psychopathological symptoms might be associated with a core set of abnormal functional brain networks incorporating default mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks as suggested by recent literature17,18.ResultsWe found two significant modes of covariation (Fig. 1) between patterns of functional brain connectivity and sets of behavioural measures, using a permutation approach (Supplementary Methods and Fig. S1). These were based on an optimal number of PCA components, d = 25, which explained 53% and 56% of the behaviour and brain connectivity variance, respectively. The first and second modes yielded canonical correlations of q = 0.62 (pFWE < 0.0001) and q = 0.58 (pFWE < 0.0134), respectively.Figure 1Significant brain-behaviour modes of covariation. Scatter plots showing the brain and behaviour scores for the first (a,c) and second (b,d) mode, where each dot represents an individual subject. Subjects are colour coded by: sex and clinical diagnosis (a,b); age (c,d). The canonical correlation, q, and corresponding p-value are shown on the top of each plot.Figure 1 shows the two significant brain-behaviour modes of covariation, representing the correlation between brain and behaviour scores of individual subjects. The first mode is associated with sex and has an interaction with depression, with healthy males clustering towards higher scores and depressed females clustering towards lower scores (Fig. 1a). Additionally, younger adolescents can be seen to have lower scores whereas older ones are distributed more towards higher scores (Fig. 1c). The characteristics of the second mode were qualitatively different. Although depressed females seemed to cluster towards lower scores (Fig. 1b) again, both males and females were evenly distributed along this mode, and younger adolescents had higher scores whereas older ones were more distributed towards lower scores (Fig. 1d).To inform the association captured by each mode, we correlated the original behavioural and connectivity variables with the subjects’ brain and behaviour scores, respectively, which revealed the behavioural variables or brain connections most strongly associated with each CCA mode (Figs 2–4). Figure 2a shows that the first CCA mode is positively associated with being male, age, measures of impulsivity, sensation seeking, drinking habits, and negatively associated with being female, depression-related symptoms and suicidal thoughts (for details, see Supplementary Table S1). Thus, the first mode has characteristic of an externalization/internalization axis, where extreme positive and negative scores represent vulnerability for males and females, respectively. Importantly, sex was weakly associated with the other top identified behavioural items (i.e. items most positively or negatively correlated with the behavioural variables) suggesting that those items are present due to an association with brain connectivity and not because of their association with sex (Supplementary Fig. S2). Brain connections most positively correlated with the first CCA mode (denoted by red edges in Fig. 3) included nodes within the dorsal and ventral attention networks and a somatomotor network; brain connections most negatively correlated (denoted by blue edges in Fig. 3) included nodes of the default mode, limbic and frontoparietal networks. Similar overall patterns were observed using different thresholds of top connections (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, when looking at the 0.5% most negatively correlated connections (top 302 connections), the subcortical network (mostly thalamus and caudate nucleus) also appeared negatively correlated with the first mode (including subcortical-subcortical connections and cortical connections with the default mode network, Supplementary Fig. S3). The list of 20 brain connections most positively/negatively associated with the first mode and their assignment to anatomical regions are described in Supplementary Table S2 and displayed on Supplementary Fig. S4.Figure 2Correlations between the behavioural variables and behavioural canonical variate (behaviour scores of all subjects) of the first (a) and second (b) CCA modes. Top 20 most positively and top 20 most negatively correlated variables are shown only. The list of correlation values and questionnaire items can be found in Supplementary Tables S1 and S3.Figure 3Correlations between the brain connectivity variables and brain canonical variate (brain scores of all subjects) of the first CCA mode in sagittal (left and right) and axial view (middle).

Nodes are colour coded by resting state networks assigning each node to one of the 7 cortical networks (based on the maximal surface based overlap) described in Yeo et al.44 or the subcortex. The list of correlation values and respective labels can be found in Supplementary Table S2.Figure 4Correlations between the brain connectivity variables and brain canonical variate (brain scores of all subjects) of the second CCA mode in sagittal (left and right) and axial view (middle).

Nodes are colour coded by resting state networks assigning each node to one of the 7 cortical networks (based on the maximal surface based overlap) described in Yeo et al.44 or the subcortex. The list of correlation values and respective labels can be found in Supplementary Table S4.For the second mode, the most positively correlated behavioural variables (Fig. 2b) related to measures of mental well-being, self-esteem, confidence, while the most negatively associated related to age, depression-related symptoms, drinking habits, suicidal thoughts and sexual abuse. Thus, this second mode captures a well-being/distress axis, along which individuals vary from high mental well-being through to distress (for details, see Supplementary Table S3). The brain connections most positively correlated (depicted in red edges in Fig. 4) with this CCA mode included nodes involving mainly the default mode and subcortical networks (thalamus); brain connections most negatively correlated (depicted in blue edges in Fig. 4) included nodes within the dorsal and ventral attention networks and the visual and somatomotor networks. A largely similar overall pattern of networks was observed using different thresholds of top connections (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, when looking at the 0.5% most positively correlated connections (top 302 connections), the limbic and frontoparietal networks also appeared positively correlated with the second mode (including cortico-cortical connections and subcortical connections mostly with the thalamus, putamen and accumbens nucleus). The list of 20 brain connections most positively/negatively associated with the second mode and their assignment to anatomical regions are described in Supplementary Table S4 and displayed on Supplementary Fig. S5.As validation of our model, we also applied a multiple hold-out framework (Supplementary Methods and Fig. S6) and found one brain-behaviour mode of covariation (Supplementary Fig. S7), based on ten PCA components (d = 10), which explained 40% and 47% of the behaviour and brain connectivity variance, respectively. Importantly, the distribution of subjects along the CCA main axis showed the same trend in the training and test sets (Supplementary Fig. S8). When ranking the original behavioural and connectivity variables according to their correlation with the subjects’ brain and behaviour scores, we obtained a very similar overall ranking for both the permutation and hold-out frameworks (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, the overlap was not very large when we considered alone the top 20 most positively and top 20 most negatively correlated behavioural and brain variables (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and Tables S5 and S6). Indeed, the scatter plots in Supplementary Fig. S9 show that only 11 brain connectivity and 11 behavioural variables overlapped when those top variables were chosen. This might be explained by the fact that we are just displaying the very top variables ranked according to their correlation value, and some correlation values simply differ from each other on the fourth decimal place. However, we can see that the overlap is more extended when the top 5% most positively and top 5% most negatively correlated variables are selected (Supplementary Fig. S9).DiscussionIn summary, leveraging both resting-state fMRI and behavioural data within a multivariate analysis framework, we identified two brain-behaviour modes of covariation in a sample of 306 adolescents and young adults. The first CCA mode relates to an externalization/internalization axis which is associated with sex. Specifically, it suggests that males are more susceptible to disruptive behaviour and alcohol use, whilst females are more susceptible to depression and self-harm. The second CCA mode relates to a well-being/distress axis which covers positive symptoms of well-being on one side and negative symptoms related to depression, suicidal thoughts, history of sexual abuse and alcohol use on the other side. Both modes are also associated with age, which could be expected considering that the sample age range covers an important developmental period. Importantly, the brain networks related to both CCA modes align well with models of brain development highlighting the sequential maturation of subcortical and cortical regions in adolescence19,20 and models of psychopathology17,18.Both CCA modes are conceptually associated with broadly described depressive psychopathology and can hence be seen as helping refine this clinical concept. It is therefore important to understand whether they capture distinctions in brain connectivity profiles alone or capture also distinctions in descriptive psychopathology. At first glance, the behavioural items common to both modes of depression, such as e.g. “…life was not worth living”, “I thought about dying”, “I cried a lot” might support the former hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are three clear differences:Firstly, the first mode is associated with a more anxious, agitated and behaviourally-activated expression of depression (four self-harm items, “I felt sick…”, “I worried…”, “I was afraid…”, “Are you emotional?”). Conversely, the second mode is associated with a more anhedonic and amotivational state (positively correlated with “…life was not worth living”, “…nothing good for me in the future”, “…feel so sad…” and negatively correlated with “…feeling interested in other people”). Interestingly, similar ‘anxious’ and ‘anhedonic’ axes have been found in other large data-driven depression studies9,21.Secondly, the first CCA mode is strongly correlated with sex, but the second mode is not. Thus the latter is a more sex independent dimension of psychopathology. Furthermore, depression-related variables of the first mode are associated with younger age, whilst depression-related variables of the second mode are associated with older age (Fig. 1c,d and Fig. 2). Accordingly, depression in the first CCA mode is related to behavioural items, such as e.g. “…I looked ugly”, “…my family would be better off without me”, “I worried about what my parents would say…”, which are more likely to be hallmarks of depression at a younger age. On the contrary, distress in the second CCA mode is related to items thought to characterise depression at an older age (e.g. “I thought about killing myself”, being drunk and drinking spirits).Thirdly, depression in the second mode is associated with sexual abuse and is negatively associated with feeling loved, confident and close to other people, perhaps indicating that sexual abuse affects these traits (however, causal attributions are not possible in this dataset).The strong relationship between sex and the first CCA mode is striking in light of recent findings that there is <10% overlap in gene expression changes in the brains of male and female humans with depression – at least in the prefrontal cortex and insula (other cortical areas were not sampled)22. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that a similar lack of overlap between the sexes also exists in a chronic variable stress mouse model22. It is interesting that both insula and the prefrontal cortex dominate the connections of the first CCA mode, being either positively (insula) or negatively (prefrontal cortex) correlated with depression. This suggests that sex interacts with depression risk in these (and likely other) areas in a way that might be fundamental to the disorder.Adolescence and early adulthood is the peak age of onset for many psychiatric disorders1,2, rendering understanding vulnerability of individuals at this age of particular relevance. Importantly, most items correlated with the CCA modes are related to psychopathology, and so the identified CCA modes might represent a two-dimensional space not only related to current depressive symptoms (or their absence), but to a latent vulnerability to psychopathology. Deeper understanding of this vulnerability may powerfully inform biologically informed interventions in young people23.Substance use is highly correlated with psychiatric disorders24,25, and it is especially detrimental in adolescence. Personality traits have an etiological role in the development of alcohol and substance use, and a vast body of research implicates two broad personality domains with opposing action tendencies, namely inhibition and disinhibition26,27. Our results concur with such a model. Alcohol usage is associated with both of our CCA modes in opposing directions. Behavioural items resembling to a disinhibited personality (first CCA mode) are positive correlations with e.g. “…enjoy doing things that are risky and dangerous?”, “…like TV, movies, comics, or electronic games with a lot of violence in them?” or “Do you like rough games and sports?”; whereas items suggestive of an inhibited personality (second CCA mode) are negative correlations with e.g. being interested in or enjoying the company of other people, or being interested in new things.As discussed above, age was associated with both CCA modes. The first CCA mode correlated positively with age (depicted in red in Fig. 2), attentional and frontoparietal networks (depicted in red in Supplementary Fig. S3a–c) and negatively correlated with subcortical-subcortical connections as well as connections within the limbic system (depicted in blue in Supplementary Fig. S3a–c). These results are consistent with models of adolescent brain development, demonstrating that subcortical and limbic regions mature in early adolescence followed by the maturation of cortico-cortical connections19,20. The second CCA mode was negatively correlated with age (depicted in blue in Fig. 2), connections within and between attentional networks (depicted in blue in Supplementary Fig. S3d–f) and was positively correlated with various subcortical-cortical connections (depicted in red in Supplementary Fig. S3d–f). Again, these results corroborate the aforementioned models of adolescent brain development. In particular, the results of the two CCA modes substantiate the sequential maturation of brain circuits, namely, the fine-tuning of circuits from subcortical-subcortical (early adolescence) to cortico-subcortical (late adolescence) and cortico-cortical (young adulthood)28. Furthermore, the sequential maturation of brain circuits might be a risk factor for alcohol use29, which aligns well with the strong positive correlation between alcohol use and age found in both CCA modes (Fig. 2).Our connectivity results are also consistent with recent literature suggesting that most psychiatric disorders emerge as a result of impairments within a few core brain circuits and networks10,17,18. In particular, the first mode was negatively correlated with depression and connections of the default mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks (Fig. 3); whilst the second mode was negatively correlated with depression and positively correlated with many default mode areas (Fig. 4). These networks underlie core social, executive and affective cognition, respectively, and dysfunctions in these networks might result in specific domains of symptoms (e.g. alterations in default mode network connectivity resulting in impaired self-representation and social functioning)17. Interestingly, due to the strong interplay between these networks, the aberrant functioning in any of these could cause impairments of the others. For example, excessive coupling between the limbic and default mode networks could mean that initial dysfunction in the former may propagate to the latter, causing depressive symptoms10,30,31. Conversely, a default mode network that can only dominate but cannot reciprocally communicate with the limbic network could prevent positive mood being established by the latter32.It is common practice in statistics to estimate a model using the entire dataset, once model selection has been performed using the permutation-based approach as described above. In contrast, in machine learning a dataset is often split into training and test sets (or training/test/validation sets) using cross-validation procedures, such that the model parameters are estimated on training data and the model performance is estimated on a test data. The permutation-based approach may be preferable to cross-validation when the number of samples is not very large, since it avoids the need to split the data into even smaller sets for training and testing. However, cross-validation approaches might be preferable if one wants to measure the robustness and generalisability of the results. In the present study, we also ran CCA embedded in a multiple hold-out framework (Supplementary Methods and Fig. S6) which was proposed by Monteiro et al.16. We found one mode of covariation, which was comparable to the first one found using the permutation framework (Supplementary Fig. S9). The second mode obtained using the permutation framework was not found with the hold-out framework, potentially due to the small sample size and the strictness of the multiple hold-out framework. The most striking finding obtained with this approach was that the distribution of the subjects along the CCA main axis on the test set was very similar to the training set (Supplementary Fig. S8), which means that the CCA mode generalised for the test set.Finally, we acknowledge limitations to the current study. Methodological limitations relate to the pipeline choice, which includes use of an atlas, full correlation as a connectivity metric and the PCA dimensionality reduction step that might remove a significant amount of signal variability of potential interest. Further work exploring other approaches to estimating resting state connectivity (e.g. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)8 and partial correlation33) and regularised or sparse CCA could be investigated to overcome potential limitations of the current pipeline. We also acknowledge the cross-sectional nature of our analysis. Future studies involving longitudinal samples could investigate how the described brain-behaviour modes of covariation change over time or whether they are predictive of future psychopathology. In addition, although we have used a multiple hold-out framework, we should ideally use an independent replication sample to validate our model. Finally, there are limitations of sample size. Future studies including big datasets, such as the ABCD study34, will be useful to explore higher variability in general population and potentially find different dimensions of psychopathology or groups of adolescents at risk.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that identifying brain-behaviour modes of covariation in healthy and depressed young people provides a powerful way of understanding the latent dimensions underlying abnormal mental states and behaviour35 and brings potential new insights into the mediation of vulnerability to mental health disorders.MethodsSubjectsIn total, 2406 healthy subjects and 50 subjects clinically diagnosed with depression (diagnosis and referral made by the subject’s NHS care service) aged 14 to 24 years were recruited from schools, colleges, National Health Service (NHS) primary care and mental health services, and via direct advertisement in London and Cambridgeshire12. This was carried out by the University College London and University of Cambridge NeuroScience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) research initiative, supported by a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) cohort was subsampled from the primary cohort, comprising a healthy cohort of 318 subjects and a depression cohort of 37 subjects. Furthermore, a demographically balanced cohort of 297 subjects was subsampled from the healthy cohort, with approximately 60 subjects in each of five age-defined strata: 14–15, 16–17, 18–19, 20–21, and 22–24 years inclusive.Of the healthy cohort (n = 297), 2 subjects were excluded due to low quality images, 1 was excluded due to gross radiological abnormalities, 4 were excluded due to missing convergence in ME-ICA pre-processing, and 9 were excluded due to excessive motion during the resting-state functional scan (5 subjects with maximum framewise displacement larger than 1.3 mm and 4 subjects with mean framewise displacement larger than 0.3 mm using calculation by Power et al.36). Of the depression cohort (n = 37), 3 subjects were excluded due to low quality anatomical scans, 1 was excluded due to radiological artefacts, 4 were excluded due to motion-induced Freesurfer reconstruction errors, 1 was excluded due to lack of convergence in ME-ICA pre-processing, 1 was excluded due to extremely low explained variance in ME-ICA pre-processing (<20%) and 2 were excluded due to excessive motion during the resting-state functional scan (applying the same criteria as for the healthy cohort). These exclusion criteria produced a final healthy cohort consisting of 281 subjects (mean age = 19.13, SD = 2.88, 144 females) and a final depression cohort comprising 25 subjects (mean age = 16.80, SD = 1.15, 21 females).Written informed consent was obtained for all subjects over the age of 16 years. For subjects under the age of 16, written informed assent was obtained for the subject and written informed consent from their parent/legal guardian. The study was ethically approved by the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with NHS research governance standards.Behavioural and demographic dataSubjects completed self-report questionnaires and cognitive tests as part of the NSPN data acquisition12. We used the following subset of these measures at the baseline study visit that assess psychopathological symptoms, personality characteristics, mental well-being and IQ as follows: Antisocial Behaviours Checklist (ABQ); Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD); Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS); Child and Adolescent Dispositions Scale (CADS); Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ); Drugs Alcohol and Self-Injury (DASI); Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU); Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10); Leyton Obsessional Inventory (LOI); Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ); Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS); Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES); Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ); Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI); Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS).Finally, we added four demographic variables (age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation index; hot coding was used for sex resulting in 2 variables; see Supplementary Material for the calculation of the deprivation index) to the items of these questionnaires resulting in a total of 372 variables.MRI data acquisitionAll MRI data were acquired on three identical 3T whole-body MRI systems (Magnetom TIM Trio; VB17 software version; Siemens Healthcare): two located in Cambridge and one located in London. Between-site reliability and tolerability of all MRI procedures were satisfactorily assessed by a pilot study of five healthy volunteers at each site37. Only scans at the baseline visit were included in the current study. Structural MRI scans were acquired using multi-echo acquisition protocol with six equidistant echo times (TE) between 2.2 and 14.7 ms and averaged to form a single image of increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)37. Apparent longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (R1 = 1/T1w) was calculated using previously developed models to create quantitative R1 maps38–40. Other acquisition parameters included: temporal resolution (TR) of 18.70 ms, spatial resolution 1.0 mm isotropic, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256, 176 sagittal slices and parallel imaging using GRAPPA factor 2 in anterior-posterior phase-encoding (PE) direction. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data were acquired using multi-echo acquisition protocol with three echo times TE = 13, 31, 48 ms, temporal resolution (TR) of 2420 ms, spatial resolution 3.8 mm isotropic with 10% gap, sequential slice acquisition, FOV = 240 × 240 mm, 34 oblique slices; bandwidth 1⁄4 2368 Hz/pixel and matrix size = 64 × 64 × 34.Structural MRI pre-processingR1 images were used to perform surface reconstruction of each subject using Freesurfer’s recon-all41 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Freesurfer average subject (fsaverage) was parcellated using a multimodal scheme that subdivides the cortex into 360 bilaterally symmetric regions based on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data14. HCP parcellation was transformed from fsaverage space to the cortical surface of each individual subject using Freesurfer’s mri_surf2surf. In addition, 16 regions were used from the subcortical segmentation of Freesurfer (thalamus-proper, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, accumbens-area, ventral diencephalon (DC) for each hemisphere).Resting-state fMRI pre-processingrsfMRI data were pre-processed using multi-echo independent component analysis42,43 (ME-ICA). ME-ICA identifies BOLD components that scale linearly with TE and discards remaining components to reduce motion-related artefacts. Only BOLD components were optimally combined to generate the denoised time-series of each voxel. A wavelet filtering was used to focus on the physiologically relevant frequency range of 0.025–0.111 Hz (scales 2 and 3). Functional scans were coregistered with each individual structural R1 images for time-series extraction. Regional time-series were estimated as the average time-series of all the voxels included in each of the 360 cortical and 16 subcortical regions. 28 regions (mostly near the frontal and temporal pole) were excluded due to low regional mean signal in at least one subject (z-score across regions within subject, z < −1.96), resulting in a total of 348 retained regions. Functional connectivity was calculated as the pairwise Pearson-correlation between time-series of each possible pair of regions resulting in a total of 60378 brain variables per subject.Behaviour and demographic data processingThe initial considered questionnaire data comprised 372 item level variables. However, we removed 8 variables for which more than 95% of subjects had the same value. Missing data were replaced by the median of the respective variable across subjects. This resulted in a total of 364 behaviour variables per subject.ConfoundsWe identified two main confound measures, whose effect was not of interest and were therefore regressed out from both brain and behavioural data:Mean framewise displacement: a summary statistic quantifying average subject head motion during the rsfMRI acquisitions (using calculation by Power et al.36).Site: each MRI site (two in Cambridge and one in London) was encoded as a one-hot variable (for example: [0 0 1] for London).Finally, each brain and behavioural variable was mean-centred and normalised (μ = 0, σ = 1), and these brain (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

CCA seeks maximal correlations between linear combinations of two or more sources of data, e.g. brain connectivity and behavioural data.To be able to apply CCA directly on this dataset, where the number of variables in both connectivity and behavioural data is greater than the number of subjects, we first reduced the dimensionality of the data using principal component analysis (PCA).

However, it is unclear what aspects of genetic and transcriptomic variation are associated with these differences. Here we investigate the genetic correlates of global cortical thickness differences (ΔCT) in children with autism. We used Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) on structural MRI data from 548 children (166 with autism, 295 neurotypical children and 87 children with ADHD) and cortical gene expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science to identify genetic correlates of ΔCT in autism. We identify that these genes are enriched for synaptic transmission pathways and explain significant variation in ΔCT. These genes are also significantly enriched for genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex (Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.11, Pcorrected  10−14), driven entirely by downregulated genes (OR = 1.87, Pcorrected  10−15). We validated the enrichment for downregulated genes in two independent data sets: Validation 1 (OR = 1.44, Pcorrected = 0.004) and Validation 2 (OR = 1.30; Pcorrected = 0.001). We conclude that transcriptionally downregulated genes implicated in autism are robustly associated with global changes in cortical thickness variability in children with autism.Subject termsGeneticsNeuroscienceissue-copyright-statement© Springer Nature Limited 2019IntroductionAutism Spectrum Conditions (henceforth ‘autism’) are characterized by difficulties in social communication alongside unusually narrow interests and restrictive, repetitive behaviours, a resistance to unexpected change and sensory hypersensitivity [1]. In addition to behavioural and clinical differences, differences in cortical morphology between individuals with autism compared to typical controls have been reported [2–5]. While heterogeneous, recent studies have reported increased cortical volumes in the first years of life with autism compared to controls, with accelerated decline or arrest in growth in adolescents [3, 4]. Changes in cortical volume may be attributed to changes in cortical thickness (CT), changes in surface area or both [3]. In support of this, studies have separately identified differences in both surface area [6] and CT [7] in children with autism. For example, Smith et al. [7] show that the developmentally accelerated gain in grey matter volume in autism is largely driven by the lack of typical age-related CT decrease (http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17010100?code=ajp-site). Furthermore, earlier studies identified differential trajectories in CT development in autism [8] as well as CT differences in autism in specific brain regions [9, 10]. In addition, Hardan et al. [11] found areas of increased CT in children with autism, predominantly in temporal and parietal lobules. In contrast however, Hadjikhani et al. [12] report a pattern of cortical thinning in adults with autism, mainly within the mirror neuron system. Both these studies point towards significant heterogeneity within findings that is at least partially related to differences in age. Despite significant heterogeneity in cortical morphology across autism imaging studies [13], recent studies have also indicated alterations in areas associated with higher cognition (e.g. language, social perception and self-referential processing) [7, 14]. This has been supported by observed differences in cortical minicolumns in association areas in individuals with autism [15].It is unclear what contributes to these differences in cortical morphology in individuals with autism. Genetic factors play a major role in the development of brain networks and volumes in typically developing individuals [16–18]. For instance, twin heritability of CT measures suggest modest to high heritability for most regions of the brain [19]. In parallel, the contribution of genetic factors for autism has been estimated between 50–90% [20–22]. Different classes of genetic variation have been associated with risk for autism. Several recent studies have identified a significant contribution of rare, de novo putative loss-of-function mutations for autism [23–27]. In addition, common genetic variants, cumulatively, account for approximately half of the total variance in risk for autism [20]. Studies have also identified genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex [28–30], enriched in processes such as synaptic transmission and astrocyte and microglial genes. These dysregulated genes may either represent causal mechanisms for risk or compensatory mechanisms as a result of upstream biological and cellular changes. Genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex are also enriched in specific gene co-expression modules identified using both adult [28–30] and fetal [31] cortical post-mortem samples.Despite considerable progress in understanding neuroanatomical and genetic risk for autism, several questions remain. Mechanistically, it is likely that genetic risk variants alter neuroanatomical structural and functional properties, contributing to behavioural and clinical phenotypes. Given the heterogeneity in autism imaging findings [13], it is pertinent to ask how genetic risk for autism is associated with variability in cortical morphology observed in individuals with autism. Thus, the goal of the present study was to identify molecular correlates of disease-related neuroanatomy irrespective of regional specific neuroanatomical differences that may not replicate well across studies [13]. Here, focusing on CT, we ask 3 specific questions: (Q1) Which genes and biological pathways are associated with in CT variability (ΔCT) in children with autism? (Q2) What is the spatial expression profile of genes associated with ΔCT? and (Q3) Are these genes enriched for three different classes of risk factors associated with autism: rare, de novo variants, common genetic variants and/or dysregulated genes in the post-mortem cortex? We address these questions by combining analysis of ΔCT in autism, as measured with MRI, with gene expression post-mortem data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS; [32, 33]).MethodsOverviewWe first assessed differences in CT (ΔCT) across 308 cortical regions in individuals with autism by extracting CT estimates for 62 children with autism (cases) and 87 matched typically developing individuals (controls) from the ABIDE-I (Table 1; Discovery dataset). Using median gene expression of 20,737 genes from six post-mortem cortical brain samples [32], we conduct a partial least squares regression (PLSR), a data reduction and regression technique, to identify significant genes and enriched pathways that contribute to ΔCT (Q1). We next quantified the expression of the same significant genes in terms of their spatial profile by comparing them across the different brain regions and Von Economo classes [45], which provides a way of assessing the hypothesis that there would be a global differentiation between higher order cognitive processing and more primary sensory processing (Q2). We tested any significant genes for enrichment for classes of genetic and transcriptomic variation associated with autism (Q3): (1) Genes dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex; (2) Adult cortical gene co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex; (3) Fetal cortical gene co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex; (4) Genes enriched for rare, de novo loss of function mutations in autism; and (5) Common genetic variants associated with autism. To assess the replicability of the findings, we validate the results using two independent datasets from ABIDE-II (Table 1). In parallel, we also used a second list of genes dysregulated in autism identified using a partially overlapping cortical gene expression data set of autism and control post-mortem brain samples to validate the enrichment analysis across all datasets. To assess specificity of our results, we furthermore sought to answer these questions in a matched MRI dataset of children with ADHD, another childhood psychiatric condition.

Further details on the Discovery and ADHD datasets are described elsewhere [34]aIndicates that the same controls were used for both the Autism Discovery and the ADHD datasets.Fig. 1Schematic overview of the methodology used to identify gene contribution. Mean cortical thickness was extracted for both the autism and the neurotypical groups across 308 cortical nodes (a). A difference score in cortical thickness (ΔCT; autism—neurotypical) was calculated between these two groups (b). In parallel the median AIBS gene expression profiles for 20,737 genes were calculated across the same 308 cortical nodes used in the imaging analysis (c). Both these streams were included in a bootstrapped PLSR analysis that used the gene expression profiles as predictors and the ΔCT as response variable (d). The PLSR assigns weights to each gene in terms of its contribution to the overall model in each component. Bootstrapped standard errors were derived and the gene weights were Z-transformed and corrected for multiple comparison using a FDR inverse quantile transform correction to account for winners curse (e; i = gene index number, z = z-score for that gene’s association and q = FDR corrected z-score). Genes that were significant after FDR correction (z-score >1.96) were analysed in terms of their spatial expression as well as tested for enrichment against three classes of risk for autism: dysregulated autism genes in the postmortem cortex, genes harbouring rare de novo variants and common genetic variants in autism (f)Discovery datasetNeuroimaging, gene expression and PLS regressionDiscovery imaging data used in this study are described in detail in the supplementary materials and elsewhere [34]. In short, structural T1-weighted MPRAGE images were obtained from the ABIDE I database (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/, selecting participants in the age range from 9 to 11, all males. All subjects were matched on age, and IQ between groups (see Table 1; Discovery Data) (see ref. [34] and Supplementary Materials for details on matching and scanner site). CT estimates were extracted using freesurfer and visually inspected for quality of segmentation by two independent researchers. Only when there was consensus between researchers were images included. Next, images were parcellated into 308 cortical regions and mean CT for these regions was extracted. In addition, scanner site was regressed out from CT estimates and the residuals were added to the group mean to allow for easier interpretation. The final sample consisted of 62 children with autism (cases) and 87 neurotypical individuals (controls).We used the transcriptomic dataset of the adult human brain created by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org) [32, 33]. The anatomical structure associated to each tissue sample was determined using the MRI data provided by the AIBS for each donor. The high-resolution parcellation with 308 cortical regions, employed in the neuroimaging dataset, was warped from the anatomical space of the average subject provided by FreeSurfer (fsaverage) into the surface reconstruction of each AIBS donor brain. After pre-processing regional gene expression values were represented as a 308 × 20,737 matrix that contained the whole-genome expression data for the 308 MRI regions of interest [35]. Code used to determine regional gene expression levels is available at (http://github.com/RafaelRomeroGarcia/geneExpression_Repository) and data used can be downloaded from Cambridge Data Repository [36]. More details on tissue sample handling, processing, batch correction and consistency of gene expression data across donors are provided in the Supplementary Materials. Cortical surface representations were plotted using BrainsForPublication v0.2.1 (10.5281/zenodo.1069156).We used PLSR to identify which genes were significantly associated with ΔCT. After obtaining PLS weights for each gene, these were z-transformed (based on standard errors obtained from bootstrapping) and FDR-adjusted using a FDR inverse quantile transformation correction to account for winners curse bias [37]. Only genes that passed FDR correction of p < 0.05 were included in enrichment analysis. We used significant genes with both negative and positive weights in our analysis. As our dependent variable, ΔCT, had both positive and negative values, weight signs were not informative about directionality in the analysis. A detailed description of the PLSR regression and the detailed rationale behind choosing the unsigned weights is provided in the Supplementary Materials.Genetic modules and enrichment analysesWe used Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr) [38, 39] to test for enrichment of significant PLSR genes for each component against Gene Ontology Biological Processes and report significant results after Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction (q < 0.05). Cell-type specific enrichment was conducted for five broad classes of cells: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and vascular cells [40]. We defined cell-type specific genes as the top 500 genes with higher expression in the cell-type compared to the remaining five genes. As these classes of genes are largely distinct with minimal overlap, we used a Bonferroni correction to correct for cell-type specific enrichment.We also investigated the enrichment in different classes of risk genes for autism using logistic regression (more detail on each class of genes can be found in the supplementary materials):Transcriptionally dysregulated genes (n = 1143, 584 upregulated and 558 downregulated in the autism cortex) were identified from Parikshak et al. [28].Adult gene co-expression modules [28].Fetal gene co-expression modules [31].Genes encriched for rare, de novo, putative loss of function variants (rare, de novo genes, n = 65) were identified from Sanders et al. [23].Common genetic variants associated with autism were downloaded from the latest data freeze from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (5305 cases and 5305 pseudocontrols). Gene based P-values and Z scores were obtained using MAGMA for each gene [41].Enrichment analyses for the different classes of autism risk genes were done using logistic regression after accounting for gene length as a covariate. Enrichments are reported as significant if they had a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjusted P-value < 0.05 [42] and if they have an enrichment odds ratio (OR) >1. The supplementary material provides further details about the gene sets and the methods used.Validation and specificityWe conducted extensive validation of our initial results against two independent datasets and checked for specificity of an autism effect against a matched ADHD dataset. There are significant phenotypic and genetic correlations between the two conditions, and we had access to MRI data from children with ADHD [34], making this a suitable dataset for testing specificity. Details on all these three datasets are provided in the supplementary materials.ResultsAutism discovery MRI datasetPLSR analyses and characterizationCross-validation using an initial 35 component analyses identified that a 13-component model had the best fit (Supplementary Table S1). Note that the number of components chosen for the model does not affect the individual component composition. Consequently, PLSR was run using a 13-component model. Four components (Components 1, 3, 4 and 6) explained more than 10% of the variance (Supplementary Figure S1). However, variance in ΔCT explained by PLS components was higher than expected by chance only for the first component (P = 0.009, 10,000 permutations) but not for the remaining components (P = 0.303, P = 0.693 and P = 0.394, for components 3, 4 and 6, respectively). Thus, only PLSR1 was used for subsequent analyses and we only included genes that passed FDR correction (q < 0.05). Only the GO term “Synaptic Transmission” in component 1 (PLSR1) survived FDR correction for multiple comparisons (Pcorrected = 0.00006). PLSR1 was also significantly enriched for 11 pathways (Table S2) in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). There was a significant positive correlation between ΔCT and the scores of PLSR1 (r = 0.32; P = 4.15 × 10−9).Cell-type specific analysis identified a significant enrichment for neurons (OR = 1.1; Pcorrected = 3.19 × 10−12), but no enrichment for genes enriched in astrocytes (OR = 1; Pcorrected = 1), oligodendrocytes (OR = 0.99; Pcorrected  1), microglia (OR = 0.97; Pcorrected = 0.43) or vascular cells (OR = 0.97; Pcorrected = 0.62).Topographical enrichment analysesPrevious studies reported an association between CT and cytoarchitectural cortical features [43] linked to specific abnormalities in laminar thickness of supragranular layers of the cortex of schizophrenia patients [44]. Here, we also conducted spatial characterization of PLSR1 across all 5 Von Economo classes [45] as well as an additional 2 subtype classes covering limbic regions and allocortex (class 6) and insular cortex (class 7) [17, 46]. We expected a potential differentiation between higher order cognitive processing and more primary sensory processing. The genes in PLSR1 were significantly over-expressed in secondary sensory and association cortices (VE classes 2, 3 and 4: all Pcorrected < 0.01) compared to a null distribution. In limbic and insular regions, however these genes appeared to be under-expressed (VE classes 6 and 7: all Pcorrected < 0.01). However, they also appear to be over-expressed in granular and primary motor cortices (VE Class 1). Figure 2 shows the results from the spatial characterization of the first component across all VE classes.Fig. 2Expression and Von Economo classification for PLSR1. The heatmap in a shows the ΔCT distribution across all 308 cortical regions. The barplot in b shows the z-scores of the mean distribution across the different Von Economo Classes (Class 1: granular cortex, primary motor cortex. Class 2: association cortex. Class 3: association cortex. Class 4: dysgranular cortex, secondary sensory cortex. Class 5: agranular cortex, primary sensory cortex. Class 6: limbic regions, allocortex. Class 7: insular cortex.). All significant over- or under-expression classes are marked with an asterisk. To determine significance, we used permutation testing and an false discovery rate corrected p-value < 0.025 to fully account for two-tailed testingGene enrichment analysesWe identified a significant enrichment for genes that are dysregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex (OR = 1.21; Pcorrected < 2.81 × 10−15), driven entirely by genes downregulated in autism cortex (OR = 1.87; Pcorrected < 3.55 × 10−16). In comparison, there was no enrichment for upregulated genes (OR = 1.01; Pcorrected = 0.49). The downregulated genes have been previously reported to be enriched for several GO terms including synaptic transmission [28].Transcriptionally dysregulated genes can reflect several different underlying processes. To provide better resolution of the processes involved, we next investigated if this enrichment was associated with six adult co-expression modules associated with dysregulated autism genes [28]. Three of these were associated with genes downregulated in the autism postmortem cortex (M4, M10, M16), and three were enriched for genes upregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex (M9, M19 and M20) compared to controls. As we had identified a significant enrichment for downregulated autism genes but not for the upregulated autism genes, we hypothesized that gene co-expression modules associated with downregulated genes would also be enriched for association with PLSR1 genes. Indeed, PLSR1 was enriched for all three downregulated modules but none of the 3 upregulated modules. See Fig. 3j, Table 2 and supplementary Table S6.Fig. 3Gene enrichment and dataset comparisons. a–c Show the correlation between ∆CT in the three datasets. d–f Show the correlation between the PLSR scores of all three datasets. g–i Show the correlation between ∆CT and the PLSR scores in all three datasets (indicating that increased scores are strongly correlated with increased ∆CT). j Shows the odds ratios for the gene-enrichment analysis in the discovery dataset.

The Mdev13, Mdev16 and the Mdev17 modules are enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes in autism postmortem frontal and temporal cortices [31]. The Mdev2 and the Mdev3 modules are enriched for rare variants identified in autism [31]. Again, we identified significant enrichment for three adult co-expression modules enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes. For the two modules associated with rare, de novo variants, we identified fewer PLSR1 genes than expected by chance. See Fig. 3j, Table 2 and Supplementary Table S6. We did not identify a significant enrichment for rare, de novo genes. We also did not identify a significant enrichment for common variants using MAGMA to collapse SNP based P-values to gene based P-values (OR = 1.00; Pcorrected = 0.29). Results of the gene enrichment analysis are provided in Fig. 3j, Table 2 and Supplementary Table S6.Validation of initial findingsPLSR analyses and characterizationWe validated all analyses using ΔCT from two independent cohorts (Table 1). There was no correlation in ΔCT between the discovery and the two validation datasets (Fig. 3a,b), which is in line with recent large scale assessments of autism neuroimaging studies [13]. This may be explained by factors such as heterogeneity due to scanner sites in the discovery dataset, age of onset of puberty and clinical conditions. There was a significant positive correlation in ΔCT between the two validation datasets (r = 0.476; P < 2.2 × 10−16). Heterogeneity in autism neuroimaging studies is well documented and complex [13, 47], but it should be emphasized that the present analysis focuses on the relation between whole-brain variation in ΔCT and whole-brain variation in gene expression, thus a lack of spatial overlap in ΔCT does not affect the ΔCT—Gene relation.Again, only the first component (PLSR1-validation1 and PLSR1-validation2; see Fig. 4) (P < 10−14, 10,000 permutations) (Supplementary Figure S2) explained a significant amount of the variance. There was a significant positive correlation between ΔCT and the gene expression scores in both validation datasets (Fig. 3h,i). Further, PLSR1 was enriched for the GO term ‘Synaptic transmission’ (Pcorrected = 1 × 10−4 for both Validation 1 and Validation 2). In addition, for Validation 2, the PSLR component was also enriched for the GO term ‘Membrane depolarization’ (Pcorrected = 7 × 10−4). KEGG pathway enrichment for both datasets are provided in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. Further, we replicated the cell-type enrichment in genes expressed in neurons (OR = 1.13; P = 2.01 × 10−7 for Validation 1 and OR = 1.06; P = 0.009 for Validation 2).Given the lack of consistent correlations in ΔCT between the original discovery dataset and both validation datasets we also added another validation dataset to confirm the PLS findings (Supplementary section 8, Figure S6). Results from this dataset were in line with the two original validation datasets and PLS weights were consistent across datasets.Gene enrichment analysesWe replicated the significant enrichment of transcriptionally downregulated genes in the autism post mortem cortex (Validation 1: OR = 1.24; Pcorrected = 0.004; Validation 2: OR = 1.3; Pcorrected = 0.001), providing confidence in the robustness of our initial results (Fig. 3k,l and Supplementary Table S6). Mirroring the enrichment with the downregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex, we also identified enrichment for the three adult gene co-expression modules that are enriched for downregulated genes in Validation 1 (M4, M10 and M16) and two of the three (M10 and M16) adult gene co-expression modules for Validation 2 (Fig. 3k,l, Supplementary Table S6). We also replicated the enrichment for the three fetal gene co-expression modules (Mdev13, Mdev16 and Mdev17) in both validation datasets (Fig. 3k,l, Supplementary Table S6). Fig. 4PLSR1 scores for all autism datasets. a–c represent the PLSR1 scores for the three autism datasets across 308 cortical regions. a Represents the discovery dataset, b represents Validation 1 and c represents Validation 2To understand the genes involved in this process, we focused on the top 200 genes (approximately 1%) based on their gene weights in PLS1 across all the three datasets (Supplementary Dataset). This identified several genes that have been implicated in autism, synaptic processes and neural development. For example, one of the genes identified is SCN1A, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel, is one of the genes identified to be frequently mutated in autism [48–50]. SLIT1 and SLIT3 are important for regulating midline axon crossing in the developing forebrain [51]. Focusing on just the top 1% in the two validation datasets, given their high correlation, we identified several other genes that have been implicated in autism and synaptic transmission including GABRA3, GABRA5 and GABRB1, all of which encode subunits of the GABA receptor. Mutations in PTCHD1, another gene identified in the top 1%, have been implicated in autism and intellectual disabilities and contributes to dysfunction of excitatory synapses [52]. SYN2 and SYT17 encode synapsin2 and synatotagmin17 respectively, which are present in the presynaptic terminal and regulate neurotransmitter release.Comparison with ADHDPLSR analysis of ΔCT in ADHD data did not identify any components that significantly explained the variance in ΔCT (Supplementary Table S5). Thus, we did not consider the ADHD dataset for further analyses. Details of the number of components, the model fit and the variance explained are provided in the supplementary materials.DiscussionHere we report the association of transcriptionally downregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex with global differences in CT in 166 children with autism and 295 neurotypical children. Using partial least squares regression on a discovery dataset of 62 cases and 87 controls, we identify one component (PLSR1) that explains a significant proportion of variance in ΔCT and is enriched for the GO term ‘Synaptic Transmission’ and for neuronal genes. This component was enriched for genes downregulated in the autism post-mortem cortex and validated using two independent datasets. We also find that PLSR1 genes are enriched for fetal and adult developmental cortical modules that have been previously reported to be enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes in the post-mortem autism cortex and for genes involved in synaptic transmission [28, 31]. We were unable to identify genes associated with ΔCT in ADHD, another childhood condition. Our study provides robust evidence linking disease-related variance in CT to synaptic genes and dysregulated genes in the autism post-mortem cortex, linking molecular and macroscopic pathology.Validation using two independent autism MRI datasets suggests that the results are valid even using MRI data from different cohorts that had different scanner settings. The results were valid despite non-significant correlations in global ΔCT between the discovery and the two validation datasets and sex did not contribute to any of the observed differences between datasets (see Supplementary material). This suggests that the same sets of genes are associated with ΔCT regardless of sex. Studies have identified differences in cortical morphology between neurotypical males and females and between males and females with autism [2, 53]. Here we identified a high correlation between a males-only dataset and two males and females combined MRI datasets for the gene weights and gene scores in the first PLS component.Changes in CT may be due to a host of factors such as changes in myelination, synaptic pruning and dendritic arborisation. Evidence from rare genetic variants [54, 55] and transcriptionally dysregulated genes in autism have highlighted a role for synaptic transmission in the aetiology of autism [28, 29]. Transcriptional dysregulation may reflect either a causative risk mechanism for autism, or a compensatory consequence of genetic, hormonal and environmental risk for autism. Here, we are unable to disentangle if transcriptionally dysregulated genes causally contribute to cortical morphology changes, or if they are both downstream of a common risk mechanism, or both. It is possible that both CT variability and transcriptional dysregulation are downstream processes of genetic variation implicated in autism, and, as such the enrichment for transcriptionally dysregulated genes need not be causative of cortical morphological changes.We did not identify enrichments for rare, de novo loss of function genes or common variants implicated in autism. The lack of enrichment with rare, de novo loss of function genes may be due to both the relative low frequencies of such variants and small proportion of variance in liability explained by rare de novo variants [20]. In contrast, the lack of enrichment with common variants may be explained by the lack of statistical power of the largest available autism GWAS dataset. Indeed, there is no enrichment for common genetic variants associated with autism in co-expression modules enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes in autism [28]. In contrast, common variants for schizophrenia are enriched in co-expression modules associated with dysregulated genes in schizophrenia [56]. It is likely that larger samples will better reveal the role of common genetic variants in cortical morphology differences in autism. While we do not know the genetic make-up of the cases and controls, our results likely represent common downstream convergence of upstream genetic perturbations.Animal studies have shown that several candidate genes for autism risk are regulated by synaptic activity, leading to the hypothesis that dysregulation in synaptic homeostasis is a major risk for autism [55]. The effects of this can contribute to both neural signal processing, and to more morphological changes in neuroanatomy via processes such as activity dependent synaptic pruning and dendritic arborization. Post-mortem studies of the brains of children and adolescents with autism have identified deficits in synaptic pruning [57]. Investigating the specific role of synaptic genes in altering neural circuitry and cortical morphology will help elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CT differences seen in autism.There are some caveats that need to be taken into consideration while interpreting these results. Gene expression data was derived from only six post-mortem adult brain samples. Gene expression is known to vary with age [58, 59]. Unfortunately, we are restricted in using the adult gene expression data from the AIBS for several reasons. First, this is the most spatially detailed dataset of gene expression. Second, the availability of MNI coordinates in the adult gene expression datasets allows for mapping of gene expression in distinct brain regions to CT differences extracted from MRI scans. Third, gene expression changes with age are limited and restricted to specific brain regions. A recent study identified only 9 genes significantly altered globally across the 10 regions investigated in post-mortem tissue samples [60], largely driven by glial genes. Cell specific enrichment in our dataset implicated neuronal genes only. Fourth, as autism is a developmental condition, investigating differences in cortical morphology at an early age is important to limit the role of environmental factors that contribute to differences in cortical morphology later in life [8, 61]. Fifth, enrichment for gene expression modules associated with autism risk in the developing cortex provides further confidence that the genes identified here are relevant across the age-spectrum. We do acknowledge that investigating a paediatric specific gene-expression dataset will help further refine the analyses, once this data becomes available.Lastly, the present study used CT in contrast to other morphological features such as cortical volume. It is known that grey matter volume relies on the relationship between two different morphometric parameters, CT and surface area that are unrelated genetically [62] and associated with different developmental trajectories1 [63]. The combination of at least two different sources of genetic and maturational influences on cortical volume would complicate meaningful analysis of associated genetic weights.To our knowledge, this is the first study linking different genetic risk mechanisms in autism with changes in cortical morphology. In sum, we have shown that genes that are enriched for synaptic transmission and downregulated in individuals with autism are significantly associated with global changes in CT. We also show that these genes are generally overexpressed in association cortices. We validated the results in multiple independent datasets but not in a matched MRI dataset that included individuals with ADHD, showing both replicability as well as selectivity.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary materialSupplementary materialSupplementary materialElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1038/s41380-018-0023-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.AcknowledgementsThis study was funded by grants from the Medical Research Council, UK, the Templeton World Charity Foundation, the Autism Research Trust and the Wellcome Trust.

Longitudinal studies have linked one-off measurements of CRP at baseline with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms subsequently at follow-up, but studies with repeat CRP measures from the same individuals are scarce.MethodsWe have examined whether longitudinal patterns of inflammation, based on three CRP measurements from childhood to early-adulthood, are associated with the risk of depression in early-adulthood in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort.ResultsUsing Gaussian mixture modelling of available CRP data from age 9, 15 and 18 years, we identified four population clusters/sub-groups reflecting different longitudinal patterns of CRP: persistently low (N = 463, 29.5%); persistently high (N = 371, 24%); decreasing (N = 360, 23%); increasing (N = 367, 23.5%). The increasing group showed a steep increase in CRP levels between adolescence and early-adulthood. Participants in this group had a higher risk of moderate/severe depression at age 18 years, compared with those with persistently low CRP; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.78 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.46–9.81; p = 0.006). The odds of moderate/severe depression were also increased for the persistently high CRP group, but this was not statistically significant; OR = 2.54 (95% CI, 0.90–7.16).LimitationsRepeat CRP measures were available for a subset, who may not be representative of all cohort participants.ConclusionsThe results suggest that an increasing pattern of inflammation from adolescence to early-adulthood is associated with risk of depression in early-adulthood.KeywordsALSPACCRPC-reactive proteinInflammationDepressionImmunopsychiatry1IntroductionDepression and other mood disorders are common in all populations [1], and a quarter of all cases emerge before 20 years of age [2,3]. Most current treatments for depression involve medication that affects the brain monoamine systems [4], however heterogeneity in clinical presentation and variability in treatment response suggest additional mechanisms are present. There is now ever increasing evidence for an association between depression and inflammation [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. CRP has been used most extensively as a measure of low-grade systemic inflammation in psychiatric [11,13,14] and physical conditions [15,16]. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies demonstrate that levels of CRP and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, are elevated in acute depression [7,[17], [18], [19]]. Similarly, longitudinal studies suggest that increased levels of inflammatory markers in childhood/adolescence are associated with increased risks of depression and psychosis subsequently in adulthood [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Using prospective birth-cohort data, we reported that higher levels of IL-6 in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression subsequently in early adulthood in a dose-dependent manner [22]. We also reported that higher IL-6 levels in childhood are associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms between the ages of 10 and 19 years [25]. Other studies have also found a longitudinal association between circulating IL-6 and CRP levels and risk of depression at follow-up [20,26]. Findings from longitudinal studies of childhood inflammatory markers suggest that inflammation precedes depression, so it could be a cause for depression rather than simply be a consequence of illness.A feature of most existing epidemiological studies of depression is that they used a one-off measure of CRP to gauge inflammation. There is some evidence that CRP and IL-6 levels remain relatively stable over time [27,28], and studies have often excluded participants with suspected infection [22,29]. Nevertheless, repeated measures within individuals over time allow to detect the level and longitudinal pattern of inflammation more accurately. To our knowledge, not many studies have examined the association between depression and longitudinal pattern of inflammation during childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. We are aware of one population-based longitudinal study that measured CRP five times between age 9 and 21 years [30]. Despite repeated measures, CRP data from only one assessment was used as predictor, reporting no association with depression in adulthood.We have investigated the longitudinal pattern of inflammation in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK general population birth cohort. We used data on serum CRP levels assessed at ages 9, 15 and 18 years to create population subgroups reflecting longitudinal pattern of CRP using cluster analysis, an unsupervised machine learning technique. We hypothesised that persistently high or increasing levels of CRP from childhood through to early-adulthood would be associated with the risk of depression in early-adulthood assessed at age 18 years.2Methods2.1Cohort description and sampleThe ALSPAC is a general population-based birth cohort. Pregnant women resident in former county Avon, UK, with expected dates of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled is 14,541 (for these at least one questionnaire has been returned or a “Children in Focus” clinic had been attended by 19/07/99). Of these initial pregnancies, there was a total of 14,676 foetuses, resulting in 14,062 live births and 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year of age.Since age 7 years, the children attended annual clinical assessments during which they participated in various face-to-face interviews and physical tests. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of age, an attempt was made to bolster the initial sample with eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally. As a result, when considering variables collected from the age of 7 onwards (and potentially abstracted from obstetric notes) there are data available for more than the 14,541 pregnancies mentioned above. The total sample size for analyses using any data collected after the age of 7 is therefore 15,247 pregnancies, resulting in 15,458 foetuses. Of this total sample of 15,656 foetuses, 14,973 were live births and 14,899 were alive at 1 year of age.Detailed information about the ALSPAC cohort can be found on the study website (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac), and the sample characteristics and methodology have been described previously [31,32]. Please note that the study website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/).The risk set for the current study includes 1627 cohort members who provided data on serum CRP levels at every follow-up at ages 9, 15 and 18 years. We excluded 66 participants who had CRP levels >10 mg/l (marker of suspected infection) at any point. Of the remaining risk set, 1462 participants took part in assessment for depression at age 18 years and were therefore included in the analyses.Ethical approval for the study was obtained from ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2004).2.2Measurement of CRPAt age 9, non-fasting blood samples were taken using standard procedures. At age 15, participants provided blood samples after a fast of at least 6 hours. Samples were immediately spun and frozen at −80 °C. There was no evidence of previous freeze–thaw cycles during storage. For high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) an automated particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche UK, Welwyn Garden City, UK) was used. All assay coefficients of variation were < 5%. At age 9, a valid measure of serum CRP was obtained from 5076 participants in total, which ranged from 0.01 to 67.44 mg/l (60 subjects over 10 mg/l). At age 15, a valid measure of serum CRP was obtained from 3490 participants in total, which ranged from 0.07 to 72.55 mg/l (60 subjects over 10 mg/l). Similar procedures were followed for measuring CRP at age 18. A valid measure of serum CRP was obtained from 3287 participants in total, which ranged from 0.02 to 176.1 mg/l (79 subjects over 10 mg/l).2.3Assessment of depression at 18 yearsThe computerised version of the Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (CIS-R) was self-administered by cohort participants in assessment clinics at average age 17.8 years (SD = 0.38). The CIS-R is a widely used, standardized tool for measuring common mental disorders in large community samples [33]. In the UK, CIS-R has been used in National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a household survey on 10,000 individuals representative of the UK population, in 1993 and 2007 [34,35]. The CIS-R is a fully structured assessment, suitable for trained social survey interviewers and does not require any expert knowledge on the part of the interviewers. As such, it can also be administered using personal computers in which the subjects self-complete the questionnaire [36].The CIS-R elicits responses to symptoms of depression experienced in the past week, and provides a diagnosis of depression according to ICD-10 criteria [37]. ICD-10 criteria for mild, moderate and severe depression were used to categorise depression severity. These were used as outcome.2.4Measurement of other variablesWe examined the association of CRP subgroups with sex, maternal education, father’s occupation, weight at birth, maternal Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS) score, body mass index (BMI) at age 18, total IQ score at age 8, atopic disorder in participants, and rheumatism or arthritis in either parent. Sex was recorded at birth and was coded as a binary variable. Father’s occupation was recorded at birth according to the UK Office of National Statistics Classification System (Class I = professionals and higher managerial workers; II = intermediate occupations; IIIa = skilled non-manual occupations; IIIb = skilled manual occupations; IV = partly skilled occupations; V = unskilled occupations), and was coded as a categorical variable (non-manual, i.e. I + II + IIIa, v. manual occupations, i.e. IIIb + IV + V). Maternal depression was measured by EPDS at 18-, 32-week gestation, and 8-week post-partum. These three values were averaged and used as a continuous variable. BMI was recoded at age 18 years, which was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metre squared. Full scale, verbal and performance IQ were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd UK edition (WISC III) (Wechsler et al. 1992). A shortened version of the test was applied by trained psychologists, whereby alternate items (always starting with item number 1 in the standard form) were used for all ten subtests with the exception of the coding subtest, which was administered in its standard form. Assessment of atopy was done through a postal questionnaire completed by parents at age 10 years old. Parents were asked whether anytime in the past a doctor had stated that the child suffered from asthma or eczema (original question: “Has a doctor ever actually said that your study child has asthma or eczema?”). Based on response to this question a single categorical exposure (or independent) variable was created, which included four groups: no asthma or eczema (reference group); only asthma or eczema; both asthma and eczema. Presence of a diagnosis of rheumatism or arthritis in either parent was also based on self-reported questionnaire data.2.5Statistical analysisStatistical analyses and graph plotting were performed in R v3.4 [38].2.5.1CRP variables preparation and population clusteringDue to skewed distributions, CRP data were log-transformed, and all subsequent analyses performed on log(CRP). Longitudinal population subgroups based on CRP data were created using Gaussian finite mixture modelling. Gaussian finite mixture modelling uses an expectation-maximisation algorithm; it is a ‘soft’ clustering algorithm which aims to find a small number of classes, homogeneous with respect to patterns in observed data (in our case, CRP levels over time). This is accomplished by decomposing complex distributions in multivariate spaces into a small number of Gaussian distributions. This procedure is implemented in R [38] within the mclust package [39]. This package has been shown to outperform similar packages [40]. Using this package, we fitted various models differing in the number of classes and cluster shapes. The evaluation of each model’s fit and the determination of the optimal number of classes were based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).2.5.2Descriptive analysisDescriptive analyses were performed using the psych v1.7 [41] package. The differences in prevalence between categorical variables were tested using χ2 tests on contingency tables, while differences in prevalence between continuous normally distributed variables were tested using ANOVA. Differences between several independent groups of non-normal continuous values were tested using a Kruskal-Wallis χ2 test.2.5.3Calculation of odds ratios (OR) for depressionMultivariate multinomial log-linear models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression associated with CRP subgroups. We included sex, maternal education, and BMI at 18 years as potential confounders, because these factors were associated with CRP sub-groups/clusters. Reference categories for the calculation of ORs were the persistently low group, male sex, lower maternal education (below A-level), and absence of depression. Analyses and plotting were performed using the packages nnet v7.3 [42], ggplot2 v2.2 [43], Cairo v1.5 [44], gridExtra v2.3 [45], dplyr v0.7 [46], and plyr v1.8 [47].3Results3.1Population subgroups of inflammation based on CRP data at ages 9, 15 and 18 yearsGaussian mixture modelling of the study population of 1561 participants with log(high-sensitivity CRP) values at 9, 15 and 18 years of age produced 2 potentially optimum models. Option 1 was an ellipsoidal clustering, with variable orientation, equal volume and shape, which identified 8 clusters in our data (BIC = -12631). Option 2 was also an ellipsoidal clustering, this time with variable orientation, volume and shape, which identified 4 clusters (BIC = -12634). Following the principle of maximal parsimony, and given that the BIC difference was minimal (3 points), we selected the second model as optimum. The four population sub-groups of CRP reflecting different patterns of inflammation over time were persistently low (N = 463, 29.5%); decreasing (N = 360, 23%); increasing (N = 367, 23.5%); and persistently high (N = 371, 24%). Subjects in the persistently low group showed the lowest average CRP values at all ages. Subjects in the decreasing group showed the second highest CRP values at 9 and 15 years of age, which decreased to the second lowest value at 18. Subjects in the increasing group showed the second lowest CRP values at 9 and 15 years, which increased to the highest levels at 18 years. Finally, subjects in the persistently high group showed the highest CRP values at 9 and 15 years, and the second highest at 18 (see Fig. 1, 3DFig. 1 : https://plot.ly/∼emosyne/2.embed, and Supplementary Table 1).

Individuals in the increasing, compared with low, CRP group had a higher risk of ICD-10 diagnosis of depression at 18 years, but this was not statistically significant; adjusted OR 1.33 (95% CI, 0.73–2.39). Additional analysis based on depression severity showed that belonging to the increasing CRP group was associated with moderate/severe depression at 18 years; adjusted OR 3.78 (95% CI, 1.46–9.81); see Table 2. The odds of moderate/severe depression were also increased for the persistently high CRP group, compared with low CRP group, but this was not statistically significant; adjusted OR 2.54 (95% CI, 0.90–7.16).Table 2Association between Longitudinal Population Subgroups of CRP and Risk of Depression at Age 18 Years.Table 2CRP GroupTotal SampleAny depression, No (%)Odds Ratio (95% CI) for DepressionUnadjustedAdjusted*Persistently lowN = 43329 (6.7%)1 [reference]1 [reference]DecreasingN = 33315 (4.5%)0.66 (0.35, 1.25)0.80 (0.41, 1.59)IncreasingN = 34628 (8.1%)1.23 (0.72, 2.10)1.33 (0.73, 2.39)Persistently highN = 35024 (6.9%)1.03 (0.59, 1.80)1.02 (0.54, 1.94)CRP GroupTotal SampleModerate/Severe depression, No (%)Odds Ratio (95% CI) for Moderate/Severe depressionUnadjustedAdjusted*Persistently lowN = 43310 (2.3%)1 [reference]1 [reference]DecreasingN = 3338 (2.4%)1.02 (0.40, 2.60)1.83 (0.62, 5.41)IncreasingN = 34619 (5.5%)2.41 (1.11, 5.26)3.78 (1.46, 9.81)Persistently highN = 35014 (4.0%)1.73 (0.76, 3.96)2.54 (0.90, 7.16)*Adjusted for sex, maternal education, BMI at 18 years.4DiscussionUsing population-based longitudinal birth-cohort data, we identified population sub-groups of young people characterised by different longitudinal patterns of peripheral inflammation levels. Subjects who showed a pattern of increasing CRP levels from childhood to early adulthood had a higher risk of moderate/severe depression at 18 years, compared with those who had persistently low CRP. Evidence for this association remained after controlling for sex, maternal education and BMI. Those with persistently elevated CRP also had increased odds of moderate/severe depression at 18, but this was not statistically significant. The results indicate that an increase in low-grade inflammation levels from childhood to early adulthood is strongly associated with risk of depression in early-adulthood.The increasing group showed a nearly 6-fold increase in average CRP levels between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and showed a significant association with moderate/severe depression at 18 years. It is therefore possible that the strongest link between inflammation and depression lies in a recent increase, and that this is more important than a chronically high CRP level with regards to future risk of depression. Whether this recent CRP elevation could be a mediating factor for links between depression and past psychological stress, abuse/maltreatment is an important hypothesis that needs to be tested in further prospective samples.Our findings add to increasing evidence supporting a link between the immune system, particularly low-grade systemic inflammation defined by elevated concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers, and depression and other major mental disorders [6,48,49]. CRP is an acute phase protein which has been studied extensively in depression and shown to be elevated in acutely unwell patients compared with controls in several meta-analyses [7,18,19]. Compounding cross-sectional evidence, recently longitudinal studies have shown that elevated cytokine levels precede, and so could potentially cause, depressive symptoms: elevated IL-6 or CRP levels in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood [20,22,23,50]. We are now more confident than ever to suggest a causal role for inflammation in depression, as two recent studies have used Mendelian randomisation to further investigate the matter. In [51], the authors find that a genotype variant associated with decreased CRP levels is also associated with reduced odds of depression. In [52], the authors found that a poly-genic risk score for high CRP levels was significantly associated with increases in the risk of depression. These studies suggest that, if the genes linked with high CRP are linked with an increase in the risk of depression, it is unlikely that this association is only due to a true causal link rather than reverse causation or confounding. This study adds to the existing evidence by showing that increasing CRP levels between adolescence and young-adulthood are associated with a subsequent ICD-10 diagnosis of moderate/severe depression in young-adulthood at age 18 years. This finding fits nicely with a causal role of high CRP in depression, as it means that depression is most likely to manifest when CRP levels rise close to the index time of examination.Based on repeat measure of CRP we report that individuals with increasing levels of inflammation over time, especially during adolescence, have higher risk of moderate/severe depression in early-adulthood. In this study we did not examine potential reasons for the increases in CRP levels during adolescence, but this is likely to include both genetic and environmental factors. Adolescence is a time of profound physical and psychological transformation. This is also a stressful time for many individuals due to, for instance, forming new relationships, peer pressure, bullying. Increasing independence and experimentation during this developmental epoch is also associated with fast-food consumption, smoking, drinking, substance use - all of these factors could increase levels of inflammation. In future, studies are required to test why a sub-group of adolescents experience a sharp increase in their level of inflammation.4.1StrengthsThe use of a general population birth cohort, a relatively large sample, and particularly repeated prospective assessment of an inflammatory marker are some of the strengths of this study. The exclusion of participants with CRP levels of >10 mg/l at any point minimised potential confounding by chronic inflammatory conditions or current infection. In addition, we adjusted regression models for maternal education (a marker of socio-economic status), sex and BMI, which are linked with inflammation levels.4.2LimitationsA key limitation is missing data. Of 14,062 live births in ALSPAC, 1627 cohort members provided serum CRP levels at all time points of 9, 15 and 18 years of age. Out of these, we excluded 66 participants who, at any point, had CRP levels >10 mg/l, and of these, 1462 participants took part in psychiatric assessment at age 18 years and were therefore included in this study. Thus, the group with CRP data at all three time points that formed the basis for our analysis may not be representative of all ALSPAC participants. Attrition in prospective cohort studies including ALSPAC is associated with lower socio-economic status and increased mental illness. Selective attrition of participants more likely to have the outcome of interest (depression) may have increased the possibility of null findings in our sample. Due to a limited sample size for repeat CRP data, we did not include additional confounders such as childhood trauma, smoking, poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and sleep disturbance, as this would have reduced the sample size further, leading to decreased statistical power.4.3ConclusionsIn summary, using repeated measurements of CRP from childhood to young-adulthood, we report that an increasing pattern of inflammation from adolescence to early-adulthood is associated with risk of moderate/severe depression in early-adulthood. Future studies should investigate the causes of this increase in inflammatory markers in the second decade of life in previously non-inflamed individuals, and the relationship these causes may have with depression.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential

Statistical methods that can integrate such multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting, poor generalization, and difficulties in interpreting the results.MethodsWe propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach, we investigated structural brain–behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires and IQ and demographic measures.ResultsBoth sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of brain–behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified brain–behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain volume.ConclusionsMultivariate techniques (such as sparse partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis) embedded in our novel framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or symptoms to neurobiology and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition of psychiatric disorders.KeywordsAdolescenceBrain–behavior relationshipDepressionFrameworkRDoCSPLSPsychiatric diagnoses [e.g., DSM-5 (1), ICD-10 (2)] lack neurobiological validity (3, 4, 5). To address this, the National Institute of Mental Health launched Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (6) in 2009, a research framework that “integrates many levels of information (from genomics and circuits to behavior) in order to explore basic dimensions of functioning that span the full range of human behaviour from normal to abnormal” (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml). RDoC represents a paradigm shift in psychiatry and highlights the need to include measures of genes, brain, and behavior to understand psychopathology (4,6). RDoC is structured as a matrix with 4 dimensions: 1) domains of functioning (e.g., negative–positive valence systems) that are further divided into constructs (e.g., attention, perception), 2) units of analysis (e.g., genes, circuits, behavior), 3) developmental aspects, and 4) environmental aspects. Analyzing data containing multiple such modalities, however, poses statistical challenges. Here, we propose a novel framework that is robust to some typical problems arising from high-dimensional neurobiological data such as overfitting, poor generalization, and interpretability of the results.Factor analysis and related methods (e.g., principal component analysis [PCA]) have long traditions in statistics and psychology (7,8). These techniques decompose a single set of measures (e.g., self-report questionnaires) into a parsimonious, latent dimensional representation of the data. Applications of these approaches include general intelligence [g factor (8)], the five-factor personality model (9), and many others (10, 11, 12, 13). However, factor analysis cannot integrate different sets of measures/modalities (e.g., investigate brain–behavior relationships).A principled way to find latent dimensions of one modality (or data type) that is related to another modality (or data type) is to use partial least squares (PLS) (14) or the closely related canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (15). PLS was introduced to neuroimaging by McIntosh et al. (16), and it has been widely used (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22). Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data makes PLS and CCA models prone to overfitting; moreover, the interpretation of the identified latent dimensions is usually difficult. Regularized versions of PLS and CCA algorithms address these issues (23, 24, 25); two popular choices are lasso (26) and elastic net (27) regularization, which constrain the optimization problem to select the most relevant variables.Sparse CCA and sparse PLS (SPLS) were originally proposed in genetics (23,28, 29, 30) and have since been used in cognition (31, 32, 33, 34), working memory (35,36), dementia (37, 38, 39, 40, 41), psychopathology in adolescents (42), psychotic disorders (43, 44, 45, 46), and pharmacological interventions (47). However, most of these studies used approaches for selecting the regularization parameter (model selection) and inferring statistical significance of the identified relationships (model evaluation) that do not account for the generalizability and stability of the results.Here, we propose an innovative framework combining stability and generalizability as optimization criteria in a multiple holdout framework (48) that is applicable to both regularized PLS and CCA approaches. Crucially, it increases the reproducibility and generalizability of these models by 1) applying stability/reproducibility for model selection and 2) using out-of-sample correlations of the data for model evaluation. To demonstrate this novel framework, we investigated associations between whole-brain voxel-based gray matter volumes and item-level measures of self-report questionnaires, IQ, and demographics in a sample of healthy adolescents and young adults (n = 312) and adolescents and young adults with depression (n = 33). We report the results from using SPLS in the main text, and for comparison we include results with another regularized approach, kernel CCA (KCCA), in the Supplement.Methods and MaterialsPLS/CCA and Other Latent Variable ModelsFigure 1 illustrates how PLS/CCA models can be used to identify latent dimensions of brain–behavior relationships. PLS/CCA maximizes the association (covariation for PLS and correlation for CCA) between linear combinations of brain and behavioral variables. The model’s inputs are brain and behavioral variables for multiple subjects (e.g., voxel-level gray matter volumes and item-level questionnaires). Its outputs, for each brain–behavior relationship, are brain and behavioral weights, brain and behavioral scores, and a value denoting the strength of the correlation/covariation.Figure 1Overview of the partial least squares/canonical correlation analysis (PLS/CCA) models. PLS/CCA models search for weight vectors that maximize the covariance (PLS) or correlation (CCA) between linear combinations of the brain and behavioral variables. Importantly, the sparsity constraints of sparse PLS set some of the brain and behavioral weights to zero. The linear combination (i.e., weighted sum) of brain and behavioral variables (columns of X and Y) with the respective weights (elements of u and v) results in brain and behavioral scores (Xu and Yv) for each individual subject. The brain and behavioral scores can be combined to create a brain–behavior latent space showing how the brain–behavior relationship (i.e., association) is expressed across the whole sample.The brain and behavioral weights have the same dimensionality as their respective data and quantify each brain and behavioral variable’s contribution to the identified brain–behavior relationship or association. Once the weights are found, then brain and behavioral scores can be computed for each subject as a linear combination (i.e., weighted sum) of their brain and behavioral variables, respectively. The brain and behavioral scores can then be combined to create a latent space of brain–behavior relationships across the sample. Furthermore, each brain–behavior relationship can be removed from the data (by a process called deflation) and new relationships sought.Next, we present a brief overview of PLS/CCA and some other latent variable models to contextualize our modeling approaches. Essentially, all these models search for weight vectors or directions, such that the projection of the dataset(s) (e.g., the brain and/or behavior) onto the obtained weight vector(s) has maximal variance (PCA), correlation (CCA), or covariance (PLS) (49, 50, 51). Note that PCA is limited to finding latent dimensions in one dataset (e.g., behavior). Although its principal components can be used in a multiple regression (referred to as principal component regression), such as to predict brain variables, the directions of high variance identified by PCA might be uncorrelated with the brain variables, while a relatively low variance component might be a useful predictor. Therefore, CCA and PLS can be seen as extensions of principal component regression to find latent dimensions relating two sets of data to each other (50,52).In the regularized versions of CCA/PLS, additional constraints (governed by regularization parameters) are added to the optimization problem to control the complexity of the CCA/PLS model and reduce overfitting. A regularized version of CCA was proposed by Hardoon et al. (53), in which two regularization parameters control a smooth transition between maximizing correlation (i.e., a CCA-like least-regularized solution) and maximizing covariance (i.e., a PLS-like most-regularized solution). Our KCCA implementation is an extension of this regularized CCA, where the kernel formulation makes the algorithm computationally more efficient (50).A regularized sparse version of CCA was proposed by Witten et al. (30), which applies elastic net regularization to the weight vectors. Interestingly, because the variance matrices are assumed to be identity matrices in this optimization, their formulation becomes equivalent to our SPLS implementation. Elastic net regularization combines the L1 and L2 constraints of the lasso and ridge methods, respectively. The L1 constraint shrinks some weights and sets others to zero, leading to automatic variable selection (26); however, it has 3 main limitations: 1) selecting at most as many variables as the number of examples/samples in the data, 2) selecting only a few from correlated groups of variables, and 3) leading to worse prediction than ridge regression when the variables are highly correlated (27). The L2 constraint shrinks the weights but does not set them to zero, enabling correlated variables to have similar weights. Combining both the L1 and L2 constraints, elastic net regularization can simultaneously enforce sparse solutions and select correlated variables while enabling optimal prediction performance (27). For further details of PLS/CCA models, see the Supplement.Model Selection and Statistical EvaluationTo motivate our proposed framework, we briefly review two landmark SPLS applications and their methods of model selection (i.e., regularization parameter choice) and statistical inference.In one of the most popular SPLS applications, Witten et al. (30) proposed 2 approaches: 1) fixing the regularization parameters of the data a priori and performing permutation testing for model evaluation and 2) using the same permutation test for both selecting the regularization parameters and evaluating the model. In the permutation test, the SPLS model is fitted to the original datasets and to the permuted datasets (i.e., after randomly shuffling one of the datasets); p values are calculated by comparing the SPLS model correlations from the original and the permuted (null) data. When this framework is also used for selecting the regularization parameters, the same procedure is repeated for each combination of regularization parameters (there is one regularization parameter for each dataset, e.g., brain and behavior), and the combination of values leading to the smallest p value is selected. Many other studies followed similar approaches either fixing the regularization parameters (23,32,38,41,54) or choosing them based on permutation tests (55,56). This framework might be preferable when the sample size is small; however, because it does not test whether the identified association generalizes to unseen or holdout data, this approach might overfit the data.Monteiro et al. (48) proposed a multiple holdout framework to optimize the regularization parameters and test the generalizability of the optimized SPLS models (Figure 2). This framework fits the SPLS model on an optimization set (e.g., 80% of the data) and assesses the identified multivariate associations on a holdout set (e.g., 20% of the data). The regularization parameters are selected by further splitting the optimization set into training and validation sets and choosing the combination of parameters with better generalization performance (measured by the out-of-sample correlation) on the validation set. To further test the robustness of the SPLS model, the entire procedure is repeated 10 times. This framework goes beyond many other SPLS approaches, which split the data once (or use cross-validation) to select the regularization parameters but do not evaluate the model generalizability on an independent test or holdout set (28,33,42,57). Although this framework provides a good test of model generalizability, it does not account for stability of the models across the different data splits while selecting the regularization parameters.Figure 2Multiple holdout framework. The original data are randomly split to an optimization set (80% of the data) and a holdout set (20% of the data). The optimization set is used to fit the regularized partial least squares/canonical correlation analysis model and optimize the regularization parameters in 50 further training and validation splits. The best regularization parameter is used to fit the regularized partial least squares/canonical correlation analysis model on the whole optimization set, and the resulting model is evaluated on the holdout set using permutation testing. Finally, the entire procedure is repeated 10 times.Our proposed framework is similar to that of Monteiro et al. (48), but it performs regularization parameter selection using stability and generalizability as a joint optimization criterion, extending the work of Baldassarre et al. (58) to regularized PLS/CCA models (Supplemental Figure S1). We measure generalizability as the average out-of-sample correlation on the validation and holdout sets for selecting regularization parameter and model evaluation, respectively. Stability is measured by the average similarity of weights (corrected overlap for SPLS and absolute correlation for KCCA) across splits, that is, how often the models (trained on different subsets of the data) select similar brain and behavioral variables (see Supplement). This joint criterion for parameter selection should enable the identification of brain–behavior associations that are stable and can generalize well to new data.DataA total of 345 participants from the NeuroScience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) project (59) were included in this study (312 healthy participants, mean age = 19.14 ± 2.93 years, 156 female; 33 participants with depression, mean age = 16.50 ± 1.23 years, 23 female). See the Supplement for the details of data acquisition and processing.All participants completed an abbreviated IQ test and extensive self-report questionnaires assessing well-being, affective symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity and compulsivity, self-esteem, self-harm, antisocial and callous-unemotional characteristics, psychosis spectrum symptoms, substance use, relations with peers and family, and experience of trauma. We added 3 demographic variables (age, sex, and socioeconomic status index) to the items of these questionnaires, resulting in a total of 364 variables, which we call behavioral data for simplicity. Including these demographic variables explicitly in the SPLS model permits investigation of whether these variables interact with brain–behavior relationships. Structural imaging scans were acquired on identical 3T Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio systems (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) across 3 sites. Only scans at the baseline study visit were included in the current analysis. Structural scans (∼19 minutes) were acquired using a quantitative multiparameter mapping protocol (60). Structural magnetic resonance imaging data preprocessing was performed using SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), including segmentation, normalization, downsampling, and smoothing (see Supplement). We then applied a mask selecting voxels with ≥10% probability of containing gray matter to all participants, resulting in a total of 219,079 voxels (brain data). Two confounds were removed (i.e., regressed out) from both datasets: total intracranial volume and data collection site (17,61).ResultsSPLS identified 2 significant latent dimensions of brain–behavior associations in our sample. Because the proposed framework fits the model to different splits of the data, here we present the results for the split that presented the best combination of generalizability (measured by the out-of-sample correlation on the holdout set) and stability (measured by the similarity of weights across the optimization sets). Results for the other data splits are in Supplemental Tables S1–S3 and Supplemental Figures S2 and S3.The first brain–behavior relationship (p = .001) captured an association between age and drinking habits and a widespread set of frontoparietotemporal cortical regions, including the medial wall (middle and posterior cingulate and medial orbital cortices), inferior parietal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyri (Figure 3). The brain weights are further summarized using an anatomical atlas in Supplemental Table S4. As expected, the SPLS weights were sparse, selecting 2% of the behavioral variables (1.73 ± 0.48% SEM across data splits) and 22% of the brain variables (36.75 ± 4.62% SEM across data splits).Figure 3Brain and behavioral weights of the two significant associative brain–behavior relationships identified by sparse partial least squares. The brain voxels are color coded by weight, normalized for visualization purposes, and displayed on Montreal Neurological Institute 152 template separately for subcortical (including hippocampus) and cortical regions. The behavioral variables are ordered by weight and color coded with red for positive weights. (A) Brain and behavioral weights of the first brain–behavior relationship. (B) Brain and behavioral weights of the second brain–behavior relationship. L, left; R, right.The second brain–behavior relationship (p = .014) captured an association between behavioral items related to depression, self-harm, and gray matter volume in a small set of regions, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, amygdala, pallidum, and putamen (Figure 3). The behavioral variables related to depression included items such as “feeling worthless,” “hated myself,” and “feeling depressed,” and the behavioral items related to self-harm included thinking about “killing myself” and “thought about dying.” The brain weights are further summarized using an anatomical atlas in Supplemental Table S4. Again, SPLS resulted in rather sparse weights, selecting 2% of the behavioral variables (3.35 ± 1.13% SEM across data splits) and 5% of the brain variables (11.85 ± 3.15% SEM across data splits).Scatterplots of the brain and behavioral scores allow us to examine how the brain–behavior relationship is expressed across the whole sample (Figure 4). The first multivariate associative effect clearly maps to age, while the second multivariate effect captured a brain–behavior association that varied from healthy to depressed, with subjects with depression presenting higher brain and behavioral scores.Figure 4Two significant brain–behavior latent spaces identified by sparse partial least squares. (A) Scatterplot of the brain and behavioral scores of the first brain–behavior relationship with subjects color coded by age. (B) Scatterplot of the brain and behavioral scores of the second brain–behavior relationship with subjects color coded by clinical diagnosis.For comparison, we performed 2 additional analyses. First, we added age to the confounds in the SPLS analysis to discount any sampling bias given that the subjects with depression were younger. Here, we identified 1 significant brain–behavior relationship that was very similar to the second depression-related associative effect of the main analysis (p = .047) (Supplemental Figures S4 and S5 and Supplemental Tables S5 and S6). Second, we used KCCA to demonstrate the framework with an alternative regularized approach. Here, we identified 2 significant brain–behavior relationships that were very similar to those identified by SPLS (first associative effect: p = .001 [Supplemental Figures S6A and S7 and Supplemental Tables S7 and S8]; second associative effect: p = .006 [Supplemental Figures S6B and S8 and Supplemental Tables S7 and S8]). For a detailed description of these results, see the Supplemental Results.DiscussionWe presented a novel framework combining stability and generalizability as optimization criteria for regularized multivariate methods, such as SPLS and KCCA, which decreases their risk of detecting spurious associations, particularly in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this framework can identify brain–behavior relationships that capture developmental variation as well as variations from normal to abnormal functioning.Our proposed framework coheres with the overarching intentions of RDoC (62,63). First, SPLS and KCCA link different levels of measures in a principled integrated analysis: here, the key levels are circuits and physiology (in brain imaging) and behavior and self-report. Indeed, RDoC views circuits as the key level anchoring and integrating the rest; however, without robust multivariate techniques, it is challenging to relate circuits to behavior in large-scale human datasets. Second, the latent dimensions identified by SPLS and KCCA may be fundamental axes of neurobiological variation spanning healthy to abnormal functioning. Application of this framework to sufficiently large clinical samples therefore might yield domains of mental (dys)function that are driven by data rather than chosen by experts (as in RDoC itself). Third, the SPLS and KCCA models output brain and behavioral scores for each individual subject in the identified latent dimensions; this is a crucial step toward using RDoC (or similar approaches) for clinical diagnosis.The model selection and statistical inference in our framework differs from those of other SPLS approaches in the literature. (Note also that these methods are not limited to SPLS but are also relevant for any regularized PLS/CCA models, including KCCA.) For model selection, some suggest fixing the regularization parameters a priori (23,30,32,38,41,54) or choosing the regularization parameters based on the performance of the SPLS model (e.g., maximizing the correlation or the associated p value of the obtained model) (36,45,46,56). Our framework is similar to other data-driven approaches that split the data into training and validation sets and use the validation set to evaluate the SPLS model and select the optimal regularization parameters (28,43,57). For model evaluation, most studies use permutation testing to evaluate the SPLS model based on all available data (30,32,45,55,56); however, this approach does not assess the model’s generalization to new data. To perform statistical inference on how the SPLS model generalizes to unseen data, independent test data (or holdout set) are needed to evaluate it (e.g., Figure 2) [as used, for example, in (23,39)]. If a validation set is used to select the optimal regularization parameter, 3 divisions of data are required: training, validation and test/holdout data (31,43,48).There are 2 main approaches in the literature to address the stability and reliability of SPLS results. The first approach is based on stability selection, which involves subsampling the (training) data and fitting SPLS with given regularization parameters. After many repetitions of this procedure, the variables selected in all SPLS models (64) or in a proportion of the SPLS models (65) are kept as the relevant variables to describe the association. This procedure can be applied to selecting variables (43,66) and to guiding model selection (40,67); however, it is computationally expensive and depends on additional parameters (e.g., number of repetitions, subsample sizes) that might need to be further optimized (68). The second approach is useful only for model evaluation and involves resampling the (overall) data (e.g., via bootstrapping) to provide confidence intervals for the SPLS model. Thus, this procedure is a complement to permutation testing; permutation testing indicates whether the identified SPLS model is different from a model obtained by chance, while bootstrapping assesses the reliability of the SPLS model (69,70).Next, we discuss the 2 significant brain–behavior relationships identified in our dataset. The first associative effect in the main SPLS results captured a relationship between age (with the highest weight) and alcohol use and gray matter volume in the cingulate and association (frontoparietotemporal) cortices. The supplementary analysis with SPLS did not find a similar effect after regressing out age from the data, whereas the KCCA analysis included age and a mixture of other factors relating to anxiety, interpersonal difficulties, and externalizing (for details, see Supplemental Results). These results demonstrate that including demographic variables such as age in the SPLS/KCCA model enables identifying variables that covary/interact with demographic variables. Furthermore, the interactive deflation procedure can be seen as an alternative strategy to remove effects (e.g., age) from the data. The frontoparietotemporal areas show the biggest loss of gray matter during adolescence (71, 72, 73); accordingly, 2 recent studies using the same community sample showed that myelination is a key factor in cortical shrinkage in these regions (74,75). These areas also relate to alcohol use; landmark studies have shown that their structural attributes (especially in frontal cortex) can predict drinking behavior later in adolescence (76,77).The second associative effect captured a relationship between depression-related items and mainly limbic regions. The main SPLS results included mainly items related to suicidality in this effect. The supplementary analyses with SPLS and KCCA selected additional items, including key depression symptoms (e.g., low mood, anhedonia, loss of energy and concentration) and core depressive beliefs (e.g., worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt, low self-esteem). Interestingly, some classic biological symptoms of depression (e.g., sleep, appetite, psychomotor disturbances) do not feature in the selected items, which are concentrated in the cognitive and behavioral aspects of depression. The brain regions with highest weights (in KCCA) or selected variables (in SPLS) were similar in all three analyses comprising amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, putamen, vermis, and insula. Despite having only 33 subjects with depression in this sample, there is a remarkable degree of overlap between these areas and those associated with depression in much larger studies. A large meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies (n = 4101 major depressive disorder [MDD] subjects) (78) also found gray matter differences in depression in insula, inferior frontal gyrus, hippocampal areas, caudate, and fusiform gyrus (and in vermis in bipolar disorder), all of which feature in this latent dimension. Whether volumes of other subcortical regions such as amygdala and putamen contribute to depression risk is more controversial; large univariate analyses have not found significant associations with depression (79,80).Although the specificity of these findings for depression is unclear—similar hippocampal and subcortical volume associations are seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (81) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (82), respectively—even cross-disorder findings may be useful for predicting outcome and, in particular, treatment response. For example, in relatively small samples, insula volume has been shown to predict relapse in MDD (83), and a combination of amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and vermis (and 3 cortical areas) can predict treatment response to computerized cognitive behavioral therapy for MDD.The identified latent dimensions also relate to existing RDoC domains, namely positive valence systems (i.e., reward anticipation and satiation that is excessive in the first [alcohol use] but impaired in the second [e.g., anhedonia]) and social processing (in KCCA only), in the attribution of negative and critical mental states to others. Another important element of the RDoC framework is the interaction of its domains with neurodevelopmental trajectories and environmental risk factors. Although our subjects were adolescents and young adults, our brain structure results were consilient with the adult depression literature (reviewed above). This is important because although some studies in children find hippocampal volume associations with both depression (84) and anxiety (85), a meta-analysis in adults with MDD concluded that hippocampal volume associations were absent at first episode (79). Indeed, our previous study of functional imaging data in this dataset revealed 2 latent dimensions of depression that had opposite relationships with age, one of which related to trauma (sexual abuse) (86).This study has some limitations. The sample size is modest, especially for participants with depression (n = 33). This, combined with the likely heterogeneity of the disorder, makes the results for the depression-related modes somewhat unstable; that is, although the selected behavioral variables are similar, some of the out-of-sample correlations are close to zero. Validation of our SPLS/KCCA models in a larger dataset of healthy adolescents and young adults and adolescents and young adults with depression would further strengthen the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of a broader selection of clinical disorders would reveal the specificity of these findings for depression rather than for psychological distress in general.Finally, we suggest some key areas for future work. First, future studies should investigate other regularization strategies for CCA and PLS; for example, applying group sparsity can capture group structures in the data that might exist owing to either preprocessing (e.g., smoothing) or a biological mechanism (43). Second, nonlinear approaches [e.g., KCCA with nonlinear kernel (50)] could explore more complex relationships between brain and behavioral data. Third, regularized CCA and PLS approaches can be used to find associations across more than 2 types of data (56,87), which may enable a more complete description of latent neurobiological (and other) factors. Fourth, the obtained latent space could be embedded in a predictive model to enable predictions of future outcomes such as treatment response. Finally, further research should investigate how these latent dimensions relate to the currently used diagnostic categories.In conclusion, we have shown that regularized multivariate methods, such as SPLS and KCCA, embedded in our novel framework yield stable results that generalize to holdout data. The identified multivariate brain–behavior relationships are in agreement with many established findings in the literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain volume. In particular, it is very encouraging that our depression-related results agree with a wider literature despite having only a small number of subjects with MDD. The depression-related dimension also contained largely cognitive and behavioral aspects of depression rather than its biological features. Altogether, we propose that SPLS/KCCA combined with our innovative framework provides a principled way to investigate basic dimensions of brain–behavior relationships and has great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition of psychiatric disorders.References1American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders5th ed.2013American

We investigated whether leveraging individual differences in information-processing impairments in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could reveal phenotypes within the disorder. We found that a subgroup of patients with PTSD from two independent cohorts displayed both aberrant functional connectivity within the ventral attention network (VAN) as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging and impaired verbal memory on a word list learning task. This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or comorbidities, but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to psychotherapy, the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we then identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by direct stimulation of that network. These alterations were associated with individual differences in functional fMRI connectivity within the VAN. Our findings define specific neurobiological mechanisms in a subgroup of patients with PTSD that could contribute to the poor response to psychotherapy."

innate immunityinflammationobsessive compulsive disorderchild and adolescent psychiatric disordersCOX-2 inhibitorimmunopsychiatryprostanoidnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugIntroductionEnzymes of the cyclooxygenase (COX) family catalyze the metabolism of arachidonic acids to prostanoids. In the central nervous system (CNS), COX-1 is constitutively expressed by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; COX-2 is expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala and is inducible in other cell types (1, 2). COX-2 and its products play important physiological role in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation but may also contribute to neuropathology by enhancing glutamate excitotoxicity, promoting neuronal cell death, and oxidizing endogenous cannabinoids (3, 4). Some studies suggest upregulation of COX-2 expression in inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases as well as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (1). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX enzymes either selectively or non-selectively. In rat models, selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib inhibit microglial activation (5) and glutamate release (6) and enhance serotonergic and noradrenergic output in the prefrontal cortex (7, 8). Meta-analyses suggest possible benefit of adjunctive COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) (9) and first-episode psychosis (10, 11); the general role of immunomodulation in these disorders has been recently reviewed (12).Sethi and colleagues provide an important and timely review of pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating the use of COX-2 inhibitors across multiple psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Other than a clinical trial protocol for celecoxib as an adjunct to vortioxetine in depression published in 2018 (13), their review of randomized controlled trials (RCT's) through November 2017 remains up to date 2 years later. In this commentary, we highlight three factors arising from their results that are essential to advancing this research agenda. First, there is a critical need to move beyond schema that use individual markers to characterize peripheral “pro-” and “anti-” inflammatory states, as well as M1/M2 microglial polarization. This model has the potential to vastly oversimplify the role of innate immunity in brain homeostasis and to limit biomarker discovery efforts. Second, COX inhibitors have direct and indirect effects on the functions of both neurons and glia. COX selectivity as well as COX-independent mechanisms of action vary among NSAIDs. More work is needed to determine which drugs of this class are the best candidates for adjunctive therapy targeting specific neuropsychiatric symptoms. Finally, childhood-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms represent important targets for early intervention with low-risk therapies, but there is little evidence to inform their use. Figure 1 outlines the potential role of COX signalling in psychiatric disorders and related research priorities.Figure 1Simplified schematic overview of COX activity in the central nervous system in psychiatric disorders. The inflammatory response may represent one mechanism by which environmental factors including psychosocial stress contribute to the development or perpetuation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with underlying genetic susceptibility. While typically inducible in other cell types, COX-2 is expressed constitutively at post-synaptic membranes by groups of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Release of prostanoids that act on pre-synaptic receptors may contribute to dysfunctional synaptic remodeling, altered calcium homeostasis, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuronal cell death. Research priorities are further described in the text.Measuring Inflammation in the Brain and Periphery: Beyond PolarizationThe identification of immune-related bio-signatures will ideally assist in predicting risk of disease, prognosis, and response to therapy (14). Sethi et al. describe elevated pro-inflammatory markers as “consistently associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms.” While promising studies have begun to identify subpopulations of patients with MDD likely to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy (15), results of immune phenotyping in other disorders have been variable. A recent systematic review found that meta-analyses for MDD, ASD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia have consistently reported changes in only 16, 7, 8, and 7 individual inflammation-related factors in peripheral blood, respectively (16). The single meta-analysis of immune phenotyping studies in OCD was filtered out because of insufficient statistical power (16). Longitudinal data were lacking and state versus trait markers difficult to distinguish, markers were restricted to a few per study based on a biased candidate gene/cytokine approach, and the contribution of confounding factors—including childhood adversity, diet, and smoking—was potentially significant (16). Ultimately, longitudinal clinical characterization combined with a broad approach to immune phenotyping—as employed in a recent analysis of microarray data in MDD (17)—is likely a higher-yield approach both for biomarker discovery and for improving our understanding of how peripheral inflammation reflects or perpetuates psychiatric symptoms.Sethi et al. also provide a common yet limiting perspective on microglial activation states. The disadvantages of the M1/M2 conceptualization of macrophage (18) and microglial (19) polarity in vivo have been previously discussed. As an in vitro construct that relies on stimulating cultured cells with a defined set of factors (20), its application to in vivo conditions is generally limited (21). Moreover, so-called M1 and M2 gene signatures often coexist in complex mixed phenotypes; the dichotomous paradigm is not supported by transcriptional profiling of human macrophages or monocytes activated by diverse ligands (22). Emerging evidence suggests that microglial subtype categorization should consider both their environment-dependent plasticity and subtypes with inherent functional specificity (23). Technologies that can assist in these efforts include two-photon imaging, whole-genome transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses at the cellular level, mass cytometry, and high-content experimental models (19).Evidence for activation of microglia in patients with psychiatric disorders does not appear to be specific for any particular diagnostic category. Post-mortem characterization of microglia together with evaluation of translocator protein positron emission tomography imaging in patients with MDD suggest that the severity of illness—marked by limited response to traditional medications and increased suicidality—rather than the presence of the disorder itself is associated with altered microglial phenotypes (24, 25). This has led to the hypothesis that inflammation in the CNS primarily reflects psychological stress (26). COX inhibition may therefore be most effective for individuals with severe pathology of diverse etiologies, and when employed at the earliest clinical stage possible may alter the path toward chronic aberrant innate immune activity.Diverse Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Mechanisms of Action: The Specific Drug MattersWhile all NSAIDS have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties attributable to prostaglandin inhibition, they vary with respect to COX selectivity (27) and likely with respect to COX-independent mechanisms (28–30). In the CNS, modulation of glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endocannabinoid signaling has been demonstrated for COX-2 inhibitors, while the role of non-selective NSAIDs in neurotransmitter function is less clear (3, 4, 6–8). NSAID use has also been associated with distinct gut microbial populations (31), an additional mechanism by which this class of drugs could affect neural development, cognition, and behaviour (32).Few RCT's have evaluated non-selective NSAIDs in primary psychiatric disorders, although the literature includes a negative RCT of naproxen in geriatric depression (33) and a study of adjuvant aspirin in schizophrenia suggesting some benefit (34). Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of children with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) recommend the use of naproxen before celecoxib because of its “greater potency” (35), despite clinical studies showing benefit of adjunctive celecoxib in OCD (36, 37) and pre-clinical data demonstrating celecoxib-mediated enhancement of the serotonergic effects of fluoxetine in a rat model of anxiety (38). Moreover, observational studies have focused on NSAIDs as a class in children with PANS/PANDAS (39, 40). Given the significance of different COX isoforms and their unknown relative “potencies” in the CNS, careful attention must be given to selection and evaluation of specific NSAIDs.Need for Pediatric Studies and Early InterventionA recent Danish population-based study suggested that environmental factors related to infection and inflammation are associated with the development of multiple mental disorders in children (41), adding to growing support for the link between immune activity and psychiatric symptoms early in life. However, there is currently little evidence to inform the use of adjunctive anti-inflammatory agents in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Studies of peripheral inflammatory markers in this population have been equivocal, largely limited by similar methodological factors as adult studies (42, 43).Early-life stress is more clearly associated with overt inflammation prior to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. For example, childhood trauma is associated with significantly elevated peripheral levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (44, 45). Elevated IL-6 in childhood is in turn associated with increased risk of future depressive and psychotic symptoms in adolescence (46, 47). Stress-related epigenetic dysregulation in immune networks represents one mechanism by which childhood experiences may become biologically embedded (48), and a potential target for early intervention. Epigenetic modifications facilitate the phenotypic plasticity of macrophages, are critical to their role in maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and contribute to a form of innate immune “memory” that persists across the lifespan (49, 50).Randomized controlled trials of COX-2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapies in children with treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders with a potential immune-mediated component may be warranted, beyond the single study of celecoxib in ASD noted by Sethi et al. Reassuring safety data exist for both celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs, derived from studies of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (51) and familial adenomatous polyposis (52). This approach may be particularly relevant in OCD given that the majority of affected individuals experience disease onset in childhood or adolescence, with a persistence rate of approximately 40% (53). Clinical practice guidelines suggesting the use of celecoxib as a third-line agent in adults with OCD (54) and naproxen or celecoxib in children with PANS/PANDAS (35) provide a further clinical imperative for these studies.ConclusionMultiple lines of evidence suggest that aberrant inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Altered immune homeostasis may represent the consequence of exposure to environmental factors including psychosocial stress together with cumulative genetic and epigenetic risk. Changes in neuroendocrine regulation, metabolism, gut microbiota, and health behaviours in turn affect peripheral and central immune cell phenotypes. For individuals with the most severe symptoms refractory to traditional treatments, modulation of the innate immune system with COX-2 inhibitors appears to be an attractive—though understudied—therapeutic approach.In characterizing state and trait markers of disease and identifying appropriate patients for anti-inflammatory treatments, broad immunophenotyping is likely to be essential. Moreover, preclinical studies suggesting effects of COX-2 inhibition on neurotransmitter function would suggest that traditional markers of inflammation in the periphery may not be required for therapeutic effect. The implications of differences in COX selectivity as well as COX-independent effects of individual NSAIDs in the CNS require further study. Finally, stressful events in childhood drive peripheral inflammation and affect neurodevelopment. Given our increasing understanding of innate immune memory and its potential role in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, the likely bidirectional relationship between inflammation and psychiatric symptoms, and the known benefits of early intervention, treatment trials of COX-2 inhibitors in carefully-selected pediatric populations are warranted.Author ContributionsCW-R conceived of and drafted the article.

Immunomodulatory drugs may have efficacy for depressive symptoms that are co-morbidly associated with inflammatory disorders. We report a large-scale re-analysis by standardized procedures (mega-analysis) of patient-level data combined from 18 randomized clinical trials conducted by Janssen or GlaxoSmithKline for one of nine disorders (N = 10,743 participants). Core depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia) were measured by the Short Form Survey (SF-36) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and participants were stratified into high (N = 1921) versus low-depressive strata based on baseline ratings. Placebo-controlled change from baseline after 4–16 weeks of treatment was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) over all trials and for each subgroup of trials targeting one of 7 mechanisms (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12/23, CD20, COX2, BLγS, p38/MAPK14). Patients in the high depressive stratum showed modest but significant effects on core depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI [0.12–0.45]) and related SF-36 measures of mental health and vitality. Anti-IL-6 antibodies (SMD = 0.8, 95% CI [0.20–1.41]) and an anti-IL-12/23 antibody (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI [0.26–0.70]) had larger effects on depressive symptoms than other drug classes. Adjustments for physical health outcome marginally attenuated the average treatment effect on depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06–0.35), but more strongly attenuated effects on mental health and vitality. Effects of anti-IL-12/23 remained significant and anti-IL-6 antibodies became a trend after controlling for physical response to treatment. Novel immune-therapeutics can produce antidepressant effects in depressed patients with primary inflammatory disorders that are not entirely explained by treatment-related changes in physical health.Subject termsDepressionPsychologyGlaxoSmithKlineJanssen Research & Development, LLCissue-copyright-statement© Springer Nature Limited 2020IntroductionActivation of the innate immune system is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Case-control studies and meta-analyses have reported that patients have modestly elevated peripheral blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP) [1, 2], tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [3–5], and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [4, 6]. Increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported [7, 8] and correlated with reduced hippocampal volume in depressed patients [9]. A central pro-inflammatory process has also been indicated by post mortem studies of microglial activation and PET studies of TSPO ligand binding in MDD [10, 11].Clinical evidence for a causal effect of inflammatory challenge on the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms includes data from interferon alpha (IFN-α) treatment trials for hepatitis C, which frequently induces symptoms of depression and fatigue, with a concomitant increase in inflammatory markers in peripheral blood [12] and CSF [13]. In the chronic social defeat stress model in rodents, animals susceptible to developing persistent depression-like behaviors manifest higher peripheral blood levels of IL-6 both before and after stress exposure [14]. Susceptibility to developing depressive phenotypes was reduced in IL-6−/− animals; but increased in wild type animals by transplanting the immune cells of donor animals that had previously expressed a depressive response to social stress [14].To date, only a few studies have addressed the therapeutic hypothesis that anti-inflammatory drugs may have antidepressant efficacy. Infliximab, an anti-TNF-α antibody, was not effective for depressive symptoms in subjects with treatment-resistant MDD; but post hoc analysis indicated that the subgroup of patients with high CRP was more responsive [15]. A small molecule inhibitor of P38 MAP kinase was not consistently effective in two studies of MDD [16]. However, there was evidence of a moderate-sized anti-inflammatory drug effect (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI [0.11–0.57]) on depressive symptoms in a meta-analysis of clinical trial data on NSAIDs and anti-cytokine antibodies in patients with a primary diagnosis of depression or inflammatory disorder [17], and in a meta-analysis of anti-cytokine antibody effects on depressive symptoms in inflammatory disorders (SMD = 0.44; 95% CI [0.22–0.59]) [4, 18–21].In any analysis of depressive symptom changes during anti-inflammatory drug treatment of an inflammatory disorder it is important to control for treatment effects on physical symptoms (e.g., swollen and painful joints in rheumatoid arthritis). Anti-inflammatory drug effects on psychological symptoms may arise secondarily to treatment effects on the physical signs and symptoms of inflammatory disorders. Alternatively, the antidepressant efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs may reflect a direct, mechanistically related effect of treatment. This hypothetical dilemma remains unresolved [17, 18].Here we report a large, integrated analysis of existing clinical trial datasets to further investigate anti-inflammatory drug effects on depressive symptoms. Access to patient-level data (N = 10,743) enabled us to identify the cohort of trial participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline, to focus on improvement in the DSM 5 cardinal depressive symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia, and to control for physical health outcomes (although high depressive patients were not randomly allocated to treatment groups in the primary studies). We analyzed 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials, sponsored by Janssen or GlaxoSmithKline, of 9 compounds targeting 7 mechanisms of action (TNF-α, IL-12/23, IL-6, CD20, COX2, BLγS, and P38/MAPK14) in patients with a primary diagnosis of one of 9 inflammatory or oncological disorders (see Table 1).Table 1Characteristics of clinical trials included in the mega-analysis.

The SF-36 comprises 36 self-report measures of physical and mental health that can be summarized by 8 domain scores and two component scores (physical and mental health). We used the mental health component score and the vitality domain score as standard SF-36 outcomes. Additionally, to focus on depressive symptoms, we constructed a depressive symptom summary score (range, 0–100). This was based on the two SF-36 questions (“Have you felt downhearted and depressed?” and “Have you felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer you up?”) that most closely corresponded to core DSM-5 symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia; see Supplementary Information. In one study (C0743T09), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS [23]) was used instead of the SF-36. In an independent study where both scales were measured, the HADS-D was significantly correlated with the defined SF-36 depressive symptom score (Spearman r = 0.63, p < 0.0001).Depressive symptom stratificationPatients were stratified as belonging to high depressive or low depressive subgroups based on their scores on the two SF-36 questions related to depressed mood and anhedonia. A patient was assigned to the high depressive stratum if they rated at least one of these two key symptoms as present at least “most of the time” in the previous 4 weeks and rated the other symptom as present at least “some of the time”; Supplementary Fig. 1. In C0743T09, patients were classified as high depressive if baseline total HADS score was ≥8 [23]. Notably patients with high depressive symptoms were not randomly allocated to treatment in any of the studies (Supplementary Table 2), which fundamentally constrains causal interpretation of treatment effects on this subgroup of patients.Analysis of baseline data and treatment effectsTreatment effects were estimated using mixed-effect linear models with repeated measures (MMRM). MMRMs were chosen for their ability to leverage all available data and to minimize the introduction of biases in the context of missing data under the assumption of missing at random [24]. The extent of missing data for each study, due to participant withdrawal, is indicated in Table 1 by the difference between N at baseline and follow-up assessments. Separate models were fit for patients in high and low depressive symptom strata. Depressive symptom score was the primary dependent variable. Treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction were fixed effects with time modeled as a repeated measure. Participants were treated as random effects in the model. For multi-country studies with >35 patients per treatment arm (Table 1), country was included as a covariate. The association of baseline biomarkers with treatment response is shown in Supplementary Table 3. The effects on antidepressant treatment outcomes of age, body mass index (BMI), sex and corticosteroid use were not consistently significant across studies; see Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2.The within-treatment change was estimated by contrasting the least square means of depressive symptom score at baseline and first follow-up visits. The drug treatment effect was estimated by contrasting the symptom change in the drug treated arm versus the placebo arm. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 and 9.4 (www.sas.com), and R 3.3.0. The statistical framework is described in more detail for the illustrative example of a phase 2 trial of sirukumab for RA, C1377T04 (Supplementary Fig. 3).Adjustment for treatment effects on physical healthWe controlled the estimation of treatment effects on mental health for the effects of treatment on physical health in two ways: (i) for each study, the severity scale used to measure clinical efficacy for primary disease signs and symptoms (e.g., DAS28-CRP in a rheumatoid arthritis trial C1377T04) was added to the mixed model as a time-dependent fixed effect; (ii) for a subset of 12 studies (delineated in Table 1) that had specified a responder/non-responder criterion a priori, we estimated the treatment effect on depressive symptoms only in those high depressive patients who were defined as non-responders on the primary (physical health) endpoint of the trial.Mega-analysisFor each study, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated by Cohen’s d: the difference in least square means between the treatment and placebo arms divided by the pooled standard deviation. This unit-less measure can be compared and combined across studies [17]. The R package metafor was used for analysis and visualization of forest plots. Treatment effects are reported primarily in terms of 95% confidence intervals on the mean SMD; if the 95% CI does not include zero, the treatment effect is statistically significant with two-tailed P < 0.05. Heterogeneity across studies was estimated by tau2, I2 and Cochran’s Q statistic (see Supplementary Information).ResultsStudy characteristicsThe clinical trials included are listed in Table 1. Active treatment groups were defined as patients receiving the new immunomodulatory drug at any dose. Treatment and placebo groups may have received concomitant medication as detailed in Supplementary Table 1.For each study we used self-reported measures of mood and anhedonia at baseline to stratify patients into two subgroups, designated as high or low depressive. The proportion of patients belonging to the high depressive stratum varied between studies categorized by primary disorder (Table 1; Fig. 1a), with the greatest proportion of high depressive patients in studies of rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.004, 2-tailed t-test, rheumatoid arthritis vs. all other disorders). Baseline CRP was measured in most studies and the mean baseline CRP (averaged across all patients in each study) correlated positively with the proportion of high depressive patients (Pearson R2 = 0.32, P = 0.04, Fig. 1b).Fig. 1High depressive symptoms in clinical trial participants at baseline. a Left panel, percentage of patients meeting criteria for high depressive symptoms at baseline for each trial, grouped by the primary disease treated in the study.

Each point corresponds to a studyTreatment and placebo effects on core depressive symptomsIn the high depressive stratum of patients (N = 1921 over all 18 studies), we estimated the change from baseline in depressive symptom severity in each treatment arm (active drug or placebo) in each study. Active drug treatment was always associated with significant improvement in depressive symptoms. However, in most (17) studies there was also significant improvement in depressive symptoms after treatment with placebo plus allowed concomitant medication. The placebo effect size varied widely between studies (Supplementary Fig. 4), possibly reflecting the heterogeneity of trial designs with respect to the control of concomitant drugs, like methotrexate or corticosteroids, that are known to affect mood states, or differences in disease states and study populations.Over all 18 trials, there was a modest but significant antidepressant effect of immunological treatments compared to placebo (SMD = 0.29; 95% CI [0.12,0.45]) (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Effects of immunomodulatory drugs (overall and classified by mechanism of action) on depressive symptoms in high depressive stratum of patients. a Change in depressive symptom scores from baseline to follow-up visit was compared between active treatment and placebo arms. The standardized mean difference (SMD) is a measure of placebo-controlled antidepressant effect size that can be compared and combined across studies. b Immunomodulatory drug effects on depressive symptoms were estimated by a linear model including the primary disease symptom scale appropriate for each study (Table 1) as a covariate to control for drug effects on physical health outcome. c Immunomodulatory drug effects on depressive symptoms were estimated only in the subgroup of high depressive patients who did not respond physically to drug treatment (non-responders)To explore the significant heterogeneity of effect sizes related to mechanistic differences between drugs, we computed placebo-controlled treatment effects on change from baseline depressive symptom scores for each of 7 clusters or classes of studies targeting the same mechanism of action: 5 studies targeted TNFα (3, infliximab; 2, golimumab); 3 targeted BLγS (belimumab); and 2 targeted IL-6 (1, sirukumab; 1, siltuximab) IL-12/23 (ustekinumab), CD20 (ofatumumab), P38/MAPK (losmapimod), or COX-2 (GW406381). The anti-IL-12/23 antibody demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = 0.48; 95% CI [0.26, 0.70]). Studies of the two anti-IL-6 antibodies also demonstrated significant antidepressant efficacy vs. placebo (SMD = 0.80; 95% CI [0.20, 1.41]). There were non-significant trends in favor of improved depressive symptoms in patients treated with the anti-BLγS antibody (SMD = 0.34; 95%CI [−0.07, 0.76]), and the two anti-TNFα antibodies (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI [−0.08, 0.67]). Studies of the small molecule COX-2 inhibitor (GW406381) demonstrated a non-significant trend in favor of improved depressive symptoms in patients treated with placebo (SMD = −0.12, 95% CI [−0.34, 0.10]), but it was notable that the change in the placebo arm of this study appeared unusually large (Supplementary Fig. 4).Controlling for treatment effects on physical health outcomesFirst, we included the continuous measure of physical sign and symptom severity measured for each study as a covariate in the model used to estimate treatment effects on depressive symptoms (Table 1). After this statistical adjustment, antidepressant effects were somewhat attenuated, but the primary mega-analytic estimate of effect size over all studies remained significantly different from zero (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI [0.06, 0.35]). The antidepressant effect of ustekinumab (targeting IL-12/23) remained significant after correction for physical sign and symptom changes (SMD = 0.40; 95% CI [0.18, 0.62]); whereas the antidepressant effect of drugs targeting IL-6 was attenuated to a non-significant trend (Fig. 2b).Second, using data from 7 Janssen and 5 GSK studies for which a prior decision rule could be used to dichotomize patients as “responders” or “non-responders” with respect to the primary (physical health) endpoint of each trial, we estimated treatment effects on depressive symptoms in the non-responder subgroups alone. The overall antidepressant effect remained significant (SMD = 0.38 95% CI [0.21, 0.55]), with significant effects on depressive symptom severity found in non-responders to treatment with anti-TNF-α (SMD = 0.35; 95% CI [0.09–0.60]) and anti-IL-6 (SMD = 0.88; 95% CI [0.16–1.59]) antibodies (Fig. 2c).Effects of treatment on the SF-36 Mental health component score and the vitality domain scoreThere was a significant effect of anti-inflammatory drug treatment over the 17 studies reporting the SF-36 for both the mental health component score (SMD = 0.28; 95% CI [0.11, 0.44]) and the vitality domain score (SMD = 0.24; 95% CI [0.09, 0.39]). However, treatment effects on the mental health component score were reduced (SMD = 0.14; 95% CI [0.02, 0.27]), and the vitality domain score was attenuated to a non-significant trend, by statistical control for treatment effects on physical health (Figs. 3 and 4).Fig. 3Effects of immunomodulatory drugs (overall and classified by mechanism of action) on SF-36 Mental Health Component (MC) scores in the high depressive stratum of patients. a Change in SF-36 MC scores from baseline to follow-up visit was compared between active treatment and placebo arms. The standardized mean difference (SMD) is a measure of placebo-controlled antidepressant effect size that can be compared and combined across studies. b Immunomodulatory drug effects on SF-36 MC scores were estimated by a linear model including the primary disease symptom scale appropriate for each study (Table 1) as a covariate to control for drug effects on physical health outcomeFig. 4Effects of immunomodulatory drugs (overall and classified by mechanism of action) on SF-36 Vitality Domain scores in the high depressive stratum of patients. a Change in SF-36 vitality domain scores from baseline to follow-up visit was compared between active treatment and placebo arms. The standardized mean difference (SMD) is a measure of placebo-controlled antidepressant effect size that can be compared and combined across studies. b Immunomodulatory drug effects on SF-36 vitality domain scores were estimated by a linear model including the primary disease symptom scale appropriate for each study (Table 1) as a covariate to control for drug effects on physical health outcomeSensitivity AnalysesThere was no significant treatment effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on the depressive symptom severity score, the mental health component score, or the vitality domain score, in parallel analyses of SF-36 data including all subjects, rather than just those with high depressive symptoms (In 18 trials; depressive symptom score: SMD = 0.00; 95% CI [−0.05, 0.06], see Supplementary Figs. 5–7). Additional sensitivity analyses were included to assess the effects of the additional covariates of age, gender, and corticosteroid use (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2), and the stringency of the definition for the high depressive symptom cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2). The effects on the SF-36 anhedonia and depression items were evaluated separately, and the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms among primary disease responders is shown (Supplementary Fig. 2).DiscussionOur principal findings are that depressive symptoms are frequent among patients recruited to clinical trials for non-psychiatric inflammatory disorders and that immunomodulatory drug treatment generally causes a modest, but significant, improvement in depressive symptoms, specifically in the subgroups of patients with high depressive symptoms at baseline (SMD = 0.29; 95% CI. 0.12–0.45). These results are compatible with prior data implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology and response to treatment of depression [1, 2, 25, 26]. This modest effect size is comparable to meta-analytic estimates of antidepressant efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with major depressive disorder [27], and comparable to the standardized effect sizes seen in meta-analyses of inflammatory cytokines in case-control cohorts [1, 4, 6, 28].In evaluating these results, it is reasonable to ask how much of the improvement in mental health is attributable to treatment benefits for the primary disease states evaluated in these trials. When we controlled statistically for treatment effects on physical health, the mega-analytic estimate of antidepressant effect size was reduced (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06–0.35) but remained significant. Likewise, anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF antibodies had significant beneficial effects on core depressive symptoms, even in patients who had not responded to treatment in terms of improved physical health for the primary disease states studied. In contrast, broader measures of mental health or vitality, which included questions probing somatic symptoms, such as fatigue, were less robust to statistical correction for physical health outcomes. We conclude that the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on depressive symptoms are not entirely attributable to their effects on physical health. However, it may be that somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue) are more strongly coupled to peripheral tissue disease activity than psychological symptoms (e.g., anhedonia). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that conventional assessments of primary disease severity sometimes included a biomarker index of inflammation (e.g., the DAS28-CRP index used to assess rheumatoid arthritis severity includes CRP). Adjusting antidepressant effects of treatment by DAS28-CRP scores may correct for not only physical health effects of treatment but may also attenuate the effect size of any treatment on depressive symptoms or fatigue that are mediated by inflammatory mechanisms.The antidepressant effect size varied between different classes of drug target. Antibodies targeting IL-6 or IL-12 and IL-23 (IL-12/23) had large and statistically significant effect sizes on core depressive symptoms before correction for physical health outcomes. Moreover, the antidepressant effect of ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23 antibody) remained significant after correction for physical health outcome, and the effect of sirukumab and siltuximab (anti-IL-6 antibodies) remained significant in non-responders for the primary disease states evaluated. A variety of evidence implicates IL-6 in the pathogenesis of depression [9, 29, 30], and a phase 2 trial of sirukumab for patients with MDD and CRP >3 mg/L has recently completed (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02473289). Increased levels of IL-12 in depressed patients were reduced by monoaminergic antidepressant treatment [31, 32]. Antibodies targeting BLγS and TNF-α also demonstrated trend-level efficacy for depressive symptoms. Small molecules targeting P38MAPK or COX2 demonstrated the least antidepressant effect which is compatible with the lack of compelling evidence for antidepressant efficacy of these mechanisms in previously published MDD trials [16].The main strength of this study is that we have reported depressive symptom outcomes in 1921 patients treated with one of a range of mechanistically selective and innovative drugs in randomized clinical trials. Access to patient-level data enabled post hoc patient stratification and statistical controls for physical health outcomes, which is not possible in literature-based meta-analyses. The main limitations are related to the fact that the primary studies were not prospectively designed to test drug effects on depressive or other psychological states. For example, depressive symptoms were usually assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. This PRO measure has the merit of being widely used, allowing consistent evaluation of treatment effects across a large number of studies and participants; however, it was not intended to serve as an endpoint for antidepressant efficacy. It is noteworthy, nonetheless, that the depressive symptom score derived from the SF-36 is significantly correlated with HADS-D scores. Similarly, the vitality domain score of the SF-36 includes questions related to fatigue but it is not designed to test efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in treating symptoms of fatigue.A related issue is that the studies were focused on a diverse range of primary disorders. The comparisons between different anti-inflammatory drug effects on depression were not controlled by design for type or severity of physical comorbidity, although we endeavored to mitigate this issue by including physical health measures as covariates in the analysis of depressive symptom scores. The primary studies also varied in terms of the “standard of care” provided to patients in both placebo and active treatment groups. In particular, studies differed in terms of allowed concomitant medications and the percentage of patients using corticosteroids. In each study, however, patients in both the placebo and active treatment groups were subject to the same standard of care, so this potential between-study difference appeared unlikely to bias within-study estimation of treatment effects; furthermore, a post hoc analysis found no significant effect of corticosteroid use on between-study variation in treatment effect size (Supplementary Table 2). Likewise, in each study, patients were well-matched for age, sex, and BMI between treatment groups, suggesting that these factors are unlikely to bias estimation of within-study antidepressant effects. We further evaluated the effect of between-study variability in age, sex, and BMI and found only a small age effect indicating that older subjects are less responsive (Supplementary Fig. 2). We were unable to rigorously assess dose-response relationships, because most studies used more than one dose of active treatment, but not always the same dose range in different studies of the same drug, and data on dose/occupancy relationships were not available for all drugs. Finally, patients with high depressive symptoms were not randomly allocated to treatment in any of the studies, which fundamentally constrains causal interpretation of treatment effects in this subgroup of treated patients.Collectively the limitations of our study highlight the need for future studies designed primarily to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on validated efficacy endpoints for depression and fatigue. Future studies also are needed to explore whether inflammatory biomarkers at baseline can identify subgroups of MDD patients likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Greater use of predictive biomarkers may also be important in managing safety risks by precluding treatment of patients unlikely to respond, We note that antidepressants include a black box warning indicating they may increase the risk of suicidal thinking in children and adolescents, and that recently the IL-17 inhibitor brodalumab was approved as a treatment for psoriasis with a warning that it has been linked to suicidal ideation [32]. In future trials of immunomodulatory drugs for inflammatory disorders associated with high levels of mental health comorbidity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it would be useful to measure outcomes early and frequently to test whether direct effects of treatment on mental health can be demonstrated before treatment effects on physical health are evident.We conclude that anti-inflammatory drugs can have therapeutic effects on psychological symptoms of depression associated with inflammatory disease that are not entirely attributable to treatment effects on physical health. Further studies are required to confirm these findings directly.Supplementary informationSupplementary InformationMembers of The MRC Immunopsychiatry Consortium are listed at the end of the paper.Publisher’s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.These authors contributed equally: Edward T.

Androgens may play a role in this male-bias by sex-differentially impacting early prenatal brain development, particularly neural circuits that later develop specialized roles in social cognition. Here, we find that increasing prenatal testosterone in humans is associated with later reduction of functional connectivity between social brain default mode (DMN) subsystems in adolescent males, but has no effect in females. Since testosterone can work directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen receptor through aromatase conversion to estradiol, we further examined how a potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), acts via the AR to influence gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC)—particularly for genes of high-relevance for DMN circuitry. DHT dysregulates a number of genes enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and for genes that in later development are expressed in anatomical patterns that highly correspond to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. DMN-related and DHT-affected genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes, many of which impact excitation-inhibition balance. Androgens have male-specific prenatal influence over social brain circuitry in humans and may be relevant towards explaining some component of male-bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions.Subject termsAutism spectrum disordersNeuroscienceGeneticsPsychiatric disordershttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004440Wellcome Trust091774/Z/10/Z091774/Z/10/ZLombardoMichael V.Baron-CohenSimonhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000781EC | European Research Council (ERC)755816LombardoMichael V.issue-copyright-statement© Springer Nature Limited 2020IntroductionIt has long been known that events occurring during prenatal development can have long-lasting programming impact on susceptibility for medical conditions that emerge later in life [1–3]. Emerging work has shown that events starting during prenatal development can have long-term impact potentially leading to increased likelihood for atypical neurodevelopmental phenotypes. For instance, neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism have been linked to multiple types of biological processes that stem from very early periods of prenatal development [4–10]. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly clear that prenatal brain development is a critical window of importance for understanding factors that increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions.Several early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorders, conduct disorder) are well known to have a sex-biased prevalence rate [11]. For example, the latest estimates for autism suggest that three males are diagnosed for every one female [12]. Several theories have been put forward to explain the sex ratio imbalance in early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions [13], over and above under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis in females [14]. One prominent theory suggests that there are factors inherent in females that act to reduce the likelihood of atypical neurodevelopment [15]. For example, a higher burden of large effect mutations are present in females compared to males with autism, suggesting that protective mechanisms in females may raise the threshold for deleterious impact of such mutations [16]. In contrast to female-specific factors reducing likelihood of autism, there may also be important male-specific mechanisms for increasing the likelihood of developing autism. We have theorized that sex steroid hormones such as testosterone may have fetal programming effects on later brain development in ways relevant to autism [17]. Recent large studies have confirmed that maternal polycystic ovary syndrome, a syndrome associated with elevated androgen levels, increases the odds for both autism and ADHD in offspring [18–20]. We also recently confirmed elevation of a latent steroidogenic factor affecting multiple steroid hormones including testosterone in the amniotic fluid of clinically diagnosed males with autism [7]. Extending into the non-clinical population, continuous variation in how much fetal testosterone (FT) an individual is exposed to in the womb is associated with behavioral variation in autistic traits [21, 22]. FT and later postnatal testosterone variation also affects specific behavioral and cognitive domains such as social cognition, language, emotion, and reward processes, which are implicated in autism and other male-biased neurodevelopmental conditions [23–25]. Thus, it may be that multiple sex-specific factors could be at work to both increase likelihood in males and decrease likelihood in females for developing early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions. Further work is needed to tease apart how these mechanisms may operate similarly or differently in males and females. In addition, translational work is needed to examine how such mechanisms directly affect biological processes supporting both typical and atypical human brain development.In this study, we first examine the question of whether FT longitudinally exerts sex-specific influence over intrinsic functional organization of specific circuits involved in social, language, and affective functions in humans. To test this question, we examined a unique cohort of individuals in whom we have measured concentration levels of testosterone directly from amniotic fluid during a midgestational window of pregnancy where fetuses are sexually differentiating and where surges in sex steroid levels may have maximal impact on early brain development [26, 27]. These individuals are now in their adolescent years and we examined how variability in FT is associated with patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity as measured with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Given known links between FT and the behavioral and cognitive domains of social cognition, social-communication, language, emotion, and reward [23, 24], we examined specific neural circuits known for their roles in these domains. We predicted that FT would act as a male-specific mechanism to influence connectivity towards atypicality and that such male-specific influence would not be observed in females.While it is important to identify associations between FT and macroscale neural circuitry, we also want to better understand how androgens like testosterone exert mechanistic influence over early prenatal neural development. Testosterone can exert gene regulatory influence through several routes. Testosterone or conversion via 5-alpha-reductase to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) could potentially act in a direct manner via the androgen receptor (AR) to influence transcription of other genes targeted by the AR. However, testosterone can also be converted to estradiol via aromatase and have different transcriptional influence over genes targeted by the estrogen receptor (ER). To understand how testosterone may have AR-dependent influence on early neural development we further examined how DHT affects gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC) [28]. Of particular interest for this work is the overlap between DHT-dysregulated genes and genes spatially expressed in similar patterns across cortex as rsfMRI-defined macroscale networks that are associated with FT. If FT influences later neural circuitry in an AR-dependent manner, we expect that the DHT-dysregulated gene set would be enriched for genes that are spatially expressed in patterns that highly resemble FT-associated rsfMRI networks.MethodsParticipantsThis study was approved by the Essex 1 National Research Ethics committee. Parents gave informed consent for their child to participate and each adolescent also gave assent to participate. Participants were 64 adolescents (32 males, 32 females; male age mean = 15.42 years, standard deviation = 0.92 years; female age mean = 15.55 years, standard deviation = 1.06 years; age range = 13.22–17.18 years) sampled from a larger cohort of individuals whose mothers underwent amniocentesis during pregnancy for clinical reasons (i.e., screening for chromosomal abnormalities). At amniocentesis, none of the individuals screened positive for any chromosomal abnormalities and were thus considered typically developing. At the time of scanning, none of the participants self- or parent-reported any kind of neurological or psychiatric diagnosis. After assays of current testosterone levels were completed, we found that the assay did not result in useable data for four males and two females, and thus these individuals were excluded from further analyses requiring intact FT and current testosterone data.Fetal testosterone collection and measurementFT was measured from amniotic fluid samples collected between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation via radioimmunoassay. This period is within the 8–24 week window that is hypothesized to be critical for human sexual differentiation [26]. Amniotic fluid was extracted with diethyl ether, which was evaporated to dryness at room temperature and the extracted material redissolved in an assay buffer. Testosterone was assayed by the Count-a-Coat method (Diagnostic Product), which uses an antibody to testosterone coated onto propylene tubes and a 125I-labeled testosterone analog. The detection limit of the assay using the ether-extraction method is 0.05 nmol/L. The coefficient of variation (CV) for between-batch imprecision is 19% at a concentration of 0.8 nmol/L and 9.5% at a concentration of 7.3 nmol/L. The CVs for within- batch imprecision are 15% at a concentration of 0.3 nmol/L and 5.9% at a concentration of 2.5 nmol/L. This method measures total extractable testosterone.Current testosterone collection and measurementCurrent testosterone during adolescence was measured from passive saliva samples using a commercial competitive ELISA (Salimetrics Ltd, US) at the Biomarker Analysis Laboratory at Anglia Ruskin University. All pipetting used a Tecan Evo liquid handler. Twenty-five microliters of saliva samples, standard and controls were pipetted into the appropriate wells of the ELISA plates, 150 µL of testosterone conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzymes was added to all wells and the plate shaken for 5 min and then incubated for 55 min at room temperature. The ELISA plates were washed four times in Salimetrics wash buffer using a Tecan Hydroflex before the addition of 200 µL of enzyme substrate (TMB), the plates shaken for 5 min and color allowed to develop for an additional 25 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µL of Salimetrics stop solution. The resulting optical density in the wells was read at 450 nm with a secondary filter correction at 620 nm. The sensitivity of this assay is 1 pg/mL. The CVs for within- batch imprecision were 4.53% for the high controls and 14.88% for the low controls.fMRI data acquisitionAll MRI scanning took place on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Center in Cambridge, UK. Functional imaging data were acquired with a multi-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with online reconstruction (repetition time (TR), 2000 ms; field of view (FOV), 240 mm; 28 oblique slices, descending alternating slice acquisition, slice thickness 3.8 mm; echo times (TE) = 13, 31, and 48 ms, GRAPPA acceleration factor 2, BW = 2368 Hz/pixel, flip angle, 90°, voxel size 3.8 mm isotropic). Resting state data were collected using a 10 min ‘‘eyes-open’’ run (i.e., 300 volumes), where participants were asked to stare at a central fixation cross and to not fall asleep. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence for warping purposes (TR, 2300 ms; TI, 900 ms; TE, 2.98 ms; flip angle, 9°, matrix 256 × 256 × 256, field-of-view 25.6 cm).fMRI preprocessingData were processed by ME-ICA using the tool meica.py as distributed in the AFNI neuroimaging suite (v2.5), which implemented both basic fMRI image preprocessing and decomposition-based denoising. For the processing of each subject, first the anatomical image was skull-stripped and then warped nonlinearly to the MNI anatomical template using AFNI 3dQWarp. The warp field was saved for later application to functional data. For each functional dataset, the first TE dataset was used to compute parameters of motion correction and anatomical-functional coregistration, and the first volume after equilibration was used as the base EPI image. Matrices for de-obliquing and six-parameter rigid body motion correction were computed. Then, 12- parameter affine anatomical-functional coregistration was computed using the local Pearson correlation (LPC) cost function, using the gray matter segment of the EPI base image computed with AFNI 3dSeg as the LPC weight mask. Matrices for de-obliquing, motion correction, and anatomical-functional coregistration were combined with the standard space non-linear warp field to create a single warp for functional data. The dataset of each TE was then slice-time corrected and spatially aligned through application of the alignment matrix, and the total non-linear warp was applied to the dataset of each TE. No time series filtering was applied in the preprocessing phase. Data were analyzed with no spatial smoothing. ME-ICA denoising was used to identify and remove non-BOLD signal fluctuation [29–31].Group independent components analysis and dual regressionTo assess large-scale intrinsic functional organization of the brain we utilized the unsupervised data-driven method of independent component analysis (ICA) to conduct a group-ICA, and then utilized dual regression to back-project spatial maps and individual time series for each component and subject. Both group-ICA and dual regression was implemented with FSL’s MELODIC and Dual Regression tools (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). For group-ICA, we constrained the dimensionality estimate to 30, as in most cases with low-dimensional ICA, the number of meaningful components can be anywhere from 10–30 [32]. From these components, we manually selected the components that best represented networks typically involved in emotion (amygdala), reward (ventral striatum), language (superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula), and social cognition (default mode network) functions.Between-component connectivity analysisTime courses for each subject and each component were used to model between-component connectivity. This was achieved by constructing a partial correlation matrix for all six components using Tikhonov-regularization (i.e., ridge regression, rho = 1) as implemented within the nets_netmats.m function in the FSLNets MATLAB toolbox (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLNets). The aim of utilizing partial correlations was to estimate direct connection strengths in a more accurate manner than can be achieved with full correlations, which allow more for indirect connections to influence connectivity strength [32–34]. Partial correlations were then converted into Z-statistics using Fisher’s transformation for further statistical analyses. The lower diagonal of each subject’s partial correlation matrix was extracted for a total of 15 separate component-pair comparisons. For each of these 15 comparisons we ran robust regression (to be insensitive to outliers) [35] (https://github.com/canlab/RobustToolbox) to examine correlations between connectivity and FT variation. This analysis was conducted twice—once with FT only and again with FT and controlling for variability in current levels of testosterone. These correlations were computed separately for males and females. Finally, we computed Z-statistics and p-values for difference between male and female correlations utilizing the paired.r function in the psych R library. False positive control was achieved with FDR q < 0.05, implemented with the p.adjust function in R.Androgen influence on gene expression in a human neural stem cell modelTo gain insight into the impact of androgens on gene expression in embryonic development, we examined data from a recent RNA-seq experiment whereby human neural stem cells (hNSC) derived from embryonic stem cells were treated with 100 nM of a potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or a control treatment (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) [28] (GEO accession number: GSE86457). The cell line used was line SA001 from a male donor, obtained from Cellartis (Goteborg, Sweden). The work was supervised by the French Bioethics Agency (Agreement number NOR AFSB 12002 43S). hNSCs were derived as described in Boissart et al. [36]. Read counts obtained from RNA sequencing of three batches (biological replicates) of treated hNSCs derived from SA001 (DMSO (n = 4;3;3) vs. DHT 100 nM (n = 3;3;3)) were analyzed, scaling them by library size using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method, implemented with the calcNormFactors function in the edgeR library [37]. Low expressing genes were removed if there was not two or more samples with more than 100 reads while the previous analysis [28] filtered out genes with less than 100 reads normalized and divided by gene length in kb for each condition and below the 80th percentile in one of the condition studied (DMSO or DHT 100 nM 24 h). This filtering left a total of 13,284 genes for further downstream analysis. Batch effects were removed using the ComBat function within the sva R library. The software utilized in the prior paper [28] for DE analysis was DESeq2 [38]. This study used the voom function from the limma library in R to estimate precision weights for linear modeling of differential expression (DE) that will account for mean-variance trends [39]. DE analysis in limma allows for utilization of the voom function to estimate precision weights that account for mean-variance trends and which are incorporated directly into linear DE models. Another unique aspect of DE analysis within limma is the incorporation of an empirical Bayes procedure for sharing information between genes in estimating variance. Genes were identified as DE if they survived Storey FDR correction at q < 0.05 [40].Isolating DMN-relevant genes based on spatial expression similarity to rsfMRI componentsWe next wanted to isolate genes with high-relevance to our specific large-scale neural circuits identified by rsfMRI ICA analysis. To achieve this aim, we used the gene expression decoding functionality within Neurosynth and NeuroVault [41] to identify genes whose spatial expression patterns are consistently similar across subjects to our rsfMRI IC maps. This decoding analysis utilizes the six donor brains from the Allen Institute Human Brain Gene Expression atlas [42, 43]. The analysis first utilizes a linear model to compute similarity between the observed rsfMRI IC map and spatial patterns of gene expression for each of the six brains in the Allen Institute dataset. The slopes of these subject-specific linear models encode how similar each gene’s spatial expression pattern is with our rsfMRI IC maps. These slopes were then subjected to a one-sample t-test to identify genes whose spatial expression patterns are consistently of high similarity across the donor brains to the rsfMRI IC maps we input. The resulting list of genes was then thresholded for multiple comparisons and only the genes surviving FDR q < 0.05 and with positive t-statistic values were considered.Gene set enrichment analysesAnalyses examining enrichment (i.e., overlap) between two lists of genes, was implemented using the sum(dhyper) function in R. For enrichments with Neurosynth Gene Expression Decoding analyses, the background set size for all enrichment analyses was set to the total number of genes considered for Neurosynth Gene Expression Decoding analyses (i.e., 20,787). We also examined enrichment with autism-associated genes listed under SFARI Gene Scoring categories (lists downloaded on 10/10/2017). The background set size for this analysis was set to the total number of genes included in the DE analysis (13,284).All enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO) database was implemented with AmiGO 2 (http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo). Here we used a custom background list, which was the total number of genes included in the DE analysis (i.e., 13,284 genes). Only GO terms surviving Bonferroni correction were used.Developmental trajectory of MEF2C expressionRNA-seq data from the Allen Institute BrainSpan Human Brain Gene Expression atlas was utilized for this analysis. We examined medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) in BrainSpan as it is the most prominent region from the IC01 functional connectivity map (see Results). We tested hypotheses about whether there is developmental upregulation of MEF2C and enhanced variability in prenatal vs. postnatal development. To test this, we used a permutation test (100,000 permutations) whereby on each permutation we randomized prenatal or postnatal labels and then re-calculated the mean difference or difference in standard deviation in expression between prenatal and postnatal (after birth) periods. We then compared the observed mean or standard deviation difference statistics to their null distributions to compute the p-value for each comparison.Follow-up experiment of DHT-dysregulation of MEF2C expression using qPCRThree lines of hNSCs cells (two derived from iPSC lines reprogrammed from male fibroblasts GM01869 and GM04603 and one derived from blood of an anonymous female donor, PB12) were treated by DMSO or DHT 100 nM during 24 h, in quadruplicates, as previously described in Quartier et al. [28]. RNA was extracted using RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) including a DNase I treatment. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time PCR quantification (qPCR) was performed on cDNA on LightCycler 480 II (Roche) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) and primers specific to MEF2C (MEF2C_RT_F: 5′-ATCGACCTCCAAGTGCAGGTAACA-3′ and MEF2C_RT_R: 5′- AGACCTGGTGAGTTTCGGGGATT-3′). All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Reaction specificity was controlled by post-amplification melting curve analysis. The relative expression of gene-of-interest vs. two references genes (GAPDH and YWHAZ) was calculated using the 2-(ΔΔCt) method. To test for DHT upregulation of MEF2C expression we utilized a linear mixed-effect model (lme function within the nlme R library) with condition and sex as fixed effects and cell line and replicate as crossed random effects. To quantify evidence of replication of the original MEF2C result in RNA-seq data, we computed a replication Bayes Factor [44]. Replication Bayes Factors >10 indicate strong evidence for replication.MEF2C expression in an iPSC model of autismMEF2C expression was examined from the RNA-seq data from Marchetto et al. [10]. This dataset comprises expression measured from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), neural progenitor cells, and neurons grown from fibroblasts of typically developing controls or patients with autism. Analyses were specifically focused on MEF2C expression and used a linear mixed-effect model ANOVA (lme function from the nlme R library) modeling diagnosis, RIN, cell type, and diagnosis⁎cell type interaction as fixed effects and subject identifier as a random effect. This ANOVA was followed-up by specific tests (lm function in R) of between-group difference within each cell type, covarying for RIN.Code availabilityThe code used to reproduce the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.ResultsSex-differential FT influence on connectivity between social brain default mode subsystemsConfirming our overall hypothesis that FT exerts sex-specific influence over connectivity between neural circuits underpinning functions affected in male-biased neurodevelopmental conditions, we find only one between-component connection that is differentially related to FT in males vs. females. This between-component connection comprises anterior and primarily cortical midline (IC01) vs. posterior (IC09) components of the default mode network (DMN) (Fig. 1a, b). On average, connectivity between these components is robustly non-zero indicating strong normative relationships between these two integral parts of the DMN. However, as FT increases, connectivity between IC01 and IC09 decreases, specifically for males but not females (male r = −0.69, p = 0.0001; female r = 0.02, p = 0.89; z = 3.35, p = 7.88e-4) (Fig. 1c). In other words, within males specifically, increasing FT has an effect of reducing connectivity between these DMN subsystems. In contrast to the sex-specific effects identified here, we also analyzed the data ignoring sex as a factor. However, we did not find any evidence of a relationship between FT and DMN connectivity that spans across the sexes (r = −0.20, p = 0.15; Supplementary Fig. 1). Because all subjects were adolescents, current levels of testosterone could play a potential mediating role in the relationship between FT and DMN connectivity. FT and current testosterone were not correlated in females (r = 0.03, p = 0.86), but showed a positive trend in males (r = 0.33, p = 0.08) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Current testosterone was also significantly negatively correlated with DMN connectivity in males (male r = −0.37, p = 0.008), but not females (female r = 0.08, p = 0.97) and there was no evidence of difference in the strength of the correlations (z = 1.55, p = 0.12) (Supplementary Fig. 3). When controlling for the effect of current testosterone, we find that sex-specific relationships between FT and DMN connectivity persist (male r = −0.63, p = 0.001; female r = 0.07, p = 0.74; z = 3.12, p = 0.001), indicating that this effect is not explained by current levels of testosterone during adolescence.Fig. 1Sex-differential relationship between FT and DMN subsystem connectivity. a, b show axial montages of the two DMN components (IC01, IC09). c Shows a scatterplot of the relationship between FT and IC01-IC09 connectivityGenes influenced by androgens and relevant to DMN circuitsWe next asked the question of how androgens may impact gene expression in early prenatal development—specifically DMN circuitry. To model these early stages of development, we re-analyzed previously published [28] transcriptomic data obtained from a human neural stem cell model (hNSC) treated with a potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 100 nM). Differential expression (DE) analysis identified 460 genes upregulated and 221 genes downregulated by DHT. Upregulated genes are enriched in numerous processes spanning angiogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis and development, enzyme linked receptor protein signaling, cell surface receptor signaling, signal transduction, cell morphogenesis, neuron development, and cell differentiation, among many others. Downregulated genes are enriched in cardiac chamber morphogenesis, regionalization, pattern specification process, neuron differentiation, neurogenesis, among many others (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). We previously reported enrichments with many autism-associated genes, which are also known as syndromic causes of autism [28]. Although our DE analyses differed from the past paper [28], the current enrichment analyses largely confirm this prior finding. Many genes listed in the ‘‘Syndromic’’ category of SFARI Gene were also DHT-dysregulated (e.g., HI1, ASXL3, CHD2, DHCR7, HCN1, MEF2C, PAX6, PRODH, PTEN, and SCN1A). Other important autism-associated genes were also DHT-dysregulated such as NLGN4X, NRXN3, FOXP1, and SCN9A. For more on this enrichment analysis between DHT-dysregulated genes and autism-associated genes for this analysis, see the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Fig. 4C.We then tested the critical question regarding whether any genes influenced by DHT in hNSCs are relevant for developing cortical networks such as the DMN, which are influenced by FT in a sex-specific manner. We used Neurosynth Gene Expression Decoding analyses to isolate spatial gene expression patterns that are similar to the DMN components identified by rsfMRI. While only four genes pass at FDR q < 0.05 for the IC09 component, 2444 genes pass at the same FDR threshold for the IC01 component. This IC01 gene set was significantly enriched in genes that are differentially expressed by DHT in hNSCs (OR = 1.88, p = 0.000002). This overlapping gene set was highly enriched in a number of synaptic processes (Fig. 2a). Several examples of such genes are shown in Fig. 2b–f—particularly myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), synaptotagmin 17 (SYT17), neurabin-1 (PPP1R9A), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), glutamate receptor 1 (GRIA1), and glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate 2 (GRIK2), sodium channel, voltage gated, type III alpha subunit (SCN3A), and sodium channel, voltage gated, type IX alpha subunit (SCN9A).Fig. 2Synaptic enrichments of DHT-dysregulated genes and genes with high levels of spatially expression similarity to rsfMRI DMN IC01 map (a) and plots of specific genes contributing to these enrichments (b–h).

The coloring in the enrichment plot in a represents terms from different Gene Ontology (GO) clustersSimilar directionality of MEF2C dysregulation in induced pluripotent stem cells of male patients with autismOf the genes that are both differentially expressed by DHT and spatially highly expressed in a pattern associated with the DMN, we followed-up one gene of particular interest—MEF2C (Fig. 3a). MEF2C is among the genes from SFARI Gene noted as a syndromic cause of autism and is differentially expressed here by DHT. MEF2C is also known to be a downstream target of the androgen receptor [45]. While MEF2C itself is not sex-differentially expressed in the brain during prenatal and adult periods of development [46, 47], as a transcription factor it can differentially target other genes as a function of sex and the degree of such sex-differential targeting explains a substantial amount of variance in sex-differential expression [48]. Confirming DHT upregulation of MEF2C expression we ran a follow-up experiment using qPCR and found that indeed the upregulation of MEF2C by DHT in the RNA-seq data is replicated using qPCR on three additional independent cell lines (t = 3.73, p = 0.003, replication Bayes Factor = 164) (Fig. 3b, c).Fig. 3a Shows spatial pattern of MEF2C expression compared to spatial rsfMRI map for IC01. The whole-brain MEF2C expression maps shown is a composite map averaging across all donors. This composite map is shown for visualization purposes only. It is not meant to reflect directly the hierarchical statistical testing as implemented with Neurosynth Gene Expression Decoding. b, c Show expression of MEF2C across RNA-seq (b) and qPCR (c) experiments. d Shows the developmental trajectory of MEF2C expression in the Allen Institute BrainSpan atlas (blue, female; red male). e Shows MEF2C expression across induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), neural progenitor cells (NPC), and neurons from cases with autism or typically developing controls (TD)We went further in subsequent analyses to identify MEF2C’s trajectory of expression in medial prefrontal cortex throughout prenatal and postnatal periods. Using the Allen Institute BrainSpan Developmental Gene Expression atlas we indeed find that prenatal development is a prominent period where MEF2C is upregulated in medial prefrontal cortex (p = 0.01). There is also enhanced variability in prenatal MEF2C expression compared to postnatal expression (p = 0.02)—an effect likely due to marked change from first to second and third trimesters of gestation. MEF2C expression increases substantially from first to second trimester of gestation and continues high levels of expression until around 2 years of age, when expression tapers off and becomes stable throughout the rest of the lifespan (Fig. 3d).Finally, we tested whether MEF2C is dysregulated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from male patients with autism and whether the directionality of such dysregulation is congruent with the directionality of DHT-influence on MEF2C expression. To achieve this aim, we re-examined a recent RNA-seq dataset, which examined iPSC, neural progenitor cells, and neurons grown from fibroblasts of male cases of autism [10]. An ANOVA examining all cell types identified a Diagnosis⁎Cell Type interaction (F = 6.89, p = 0.0047). Congruent with the directionality of DHT upregulation, MEF2C is also upregulated in iPSCs from male patients with autism (t = 3.68, p = 0.0035, Cohen’s d = 1.42). In contrast, no dysregulation is observed in neural progenitor cells (t = 0.12, p = 0.90, Cohen’s d = 0.11) or neurons in autism (t = 2.19, p = 0.052, Cohen’s d = 1.31) (Fig. 3e).DiscussionIn this study, we have shown that variation in testosterone during midgestational prenatal development has long-lasting effects on how specific networks comprising the core of the social brain, the DMN, are organized. In line with hypotheses about sex-specific mechanisms, we identified that the fetal programming impact of testosterone on later circuit-level organization of the DMN depends on whether an individual is male or female. These findings are compatible with other normative large-scale work on sex differences in DMN connectivity. Two large independent studies on adults utilizing the 1000 Functional Connectomes or UK Biobank datasets now replicably show that default mode connectivity is subtly on-average stronger in females than in males [49, 50]. While these prior and much larger studies find these subtle DMN sex differences, it is noteworthy that sex differences in DMN connectivity were not apparent in the current dataset (t = 0.23, p = 0.81; Supplementary Fig. 5). This result is most likely due to lack of statistical power for identifying the subtle sex differences that prior and much larger studies have identified. Nevertheless, the directionality of documented on-average DMN sex differences in functional connectivity are congruent with the directionality of the male-specific influence shown here—FT reduces later DMN connectivity, and thus could be one explanation behind the on-average lower DMN connectivity in males observed in other studies [49, 50].These findings are also particularly relevant for understanding how the prenatal environmental shapes early neurobiological mechanisms and heightens male-susceptibility for early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions. Autism is an early neurodevelopmental condition of particular relevance here, given the 3:1 sex ratio [12] alongside other work implicating elevated prenatal steroidogenic activity [7, 18]. The hallmark features of autism are profound difficulties with early social-communication and social behavior, which has led to many investigations on the possible link with default mode network organization and function. The two core DMN subsystems identified in this work are known for the importance in both mentalizing and self-referential cognition and these domains along with the DMN circuitry underlying them are known to be atypical in males with autism [51–54]. The current results suggest that FT could act as a male-specific mechanism that reduces connectivity between core default mode subsystems linked to domains that are highly important for social-communication.Showing that FT influences later functional organization within the human brain is the first step in understanding the developmental biology behind this effect. Imperative in working towards this translational goal is the need to understand how FT might have male-specific biological effects on developing neural circuits for the social brain, such as the DMN. Using a human neural stem cell model, we identified a subset of genes that are differentially expressed after androgen treatment. In an important link to autism, this set of genes is enriched in a number of high-impact genes known to be causes of syndromic autism and intellectual disability. This finding underscores a prior paper [28] utilizing the same dataset that came across similar findings albeit with a different approach for differential expression analysis. However, this finding makes some specific inferences with regards to enrichments with the ‘‘syndromic’’ category of variants (n = 102) labeled within SFARI Gene, whereas the prior paper looked for enrichment with any of n = 235 genes annotated within SFARI Gene.In keeping with the relevant early phase of neurodevelopment for hNSCs, the DHT manipulation affected many genes involved in important neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis, cell differentiation, pattern specification and regionalization, and morphogenesis. These findings are also in line with previous work [28] whereby independent experiments showed that DHT enhances cell proliferation and prevents cell death during neuronal differentiation under nutrient-deprived conditions. These processes are hypothesized to be some of the earliest key prenatal processes that are affected in autism and dysregulation of these processes can have multifinal outcomes and pleiotropic effects later in life including atypical circuit formation and function [55]. Androgen activity can be considered as a gene regulatory influence over prenatal brain development given that such sex hormones work via androgen receptor signaling to directly affect transcription of many other genes. This work further supports the idea that androgens can exert regulatory impact over prenatal neurobiological processes that are highly linked to male-biased conditions like autism.Going beyond the list of DHT-dysregulated genes, we went further to pinpoint a subset of DHT-influenced genes that are also highly relevant specifically for the cortical midline DMN subsystem that shows a male-specific influence of FT. This subset of DHT-dysregulated and cortical midline DMN-relevant genes was enriched for a variety of synaptic processes and potentially highlights important biological mechanisms in prenatal development that androgens act on. For example, the top enrichment in such genes was for excitatory postsynaptic potentials and includes genes for glutamate receptors such as GRIK2, GRIA1, and GRIA2, all of which are upregulated by DHT. Also included in this enrichment is MEF2C, which is upregulated by DHT, and is known to alter excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance [56, 57]. Also relevant to E-I imbalance is NPTX2, which has effects on GluA4-containing AMPA receptors [58] and synaptogenesis [59]. DHT also upregulates sodium-gated ion channel genes (SCN3A, SCN9A), which have spatial similarity expression with cortical midline DMN and could also be relevant to E-I imbalance. All of these effects whereby DHT upregulates expression of such genes may point to the importance of E-I imbalance in androgen-impact on early prenatal brain development. This is particularly relevant to autism given common theoretical views about E-I imbalance in autism [60]. Because these genes are highly expressed in spatial patterns resembling the DMN network we find associated with FT in rsfMRI, it may be that these are key mechanisms of prenatal androgen-impact on early developing social brain DMN circuit formation and maintenance.While there are many genes from this work that could be focused on, we particularly highlight the role of MEF2C. Ample evidence supports the involvement of MEF2C as a candidate mechanism involved in male-biased early developmental conditions such as autism and intellectual disability [4, 57, 61–64]. Developmentally, MEF2C is highly expressed during prenatal development (Fig. 3d). Within prenatal development MEF2C has the potential to be a transcriptional regulator of a number of autism-associated genes— MEF2C binding motifs are enriched in upstream regions of genes within prenatal gene co-expression modules that harbor a number of autism-associated genes [4]. Congruent with the idea that MEF2C is important for many prenatal neurodevelopmental processes, other work has shown it is involved in neurogenesis, cell differentiation, maturation, and migration [65–67] as well as having later roles to play in experience-dependent synaptic development and cell death [56, 57, 68, 69]. MEF2C is also a known downstream target of the androgen receptor (AR), thus making it highly susceptible to androgen-dependent transcriptional influence [45]. MEF2C is also one of the most important transcription factor genes influencing sex differences in human brain gene expression—MEF2C differentially targets genes as a function of sex, and the magnitude of this sex-differential targeting explains a large percentage of variance in sex differences in gene expression of its putative targets [48]. Our work further underscores MEF2C’s involvement in male-specific mechanisms behind atypical neurodevelopment, and particularly highlights how MEF2C could be one of many candidates behind fetal programming effects of androgens on developing social brain circuits such as the DMN. Compatible with effects on early neurogenesis and differentiation, we find evidence that MEF2C expression is dysregulated in the same direction as FT influence in iPS cells in male cases with autism. Thus, important future work could examine AR targeting of MEF2C and its effect on early neurogenesis and differentiation processes. Finally, while available data suggests that rare deleterious MEF2C mutations are not more prevalent in males vs. females with autism or intellectual disability [70–72], it is unclear whether sex effects would exist in more subtle missense mutations or whether effects might appear with much larger sample size. It will be important in future work to examine these questions with larger datasets.There are some important caveats and limitations to be discussed. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, it is noteworthy that FT exhibits a much larger range of variability in males than females. From the current data we cannot determine whether females might show a similar effect if FT variability was enhanced to a similar range as that of males. Thus, the interpretations must be tempered by the caveat that the current data cannot tell us whether the observed effects are due to a fundamental difference in the how males vs. females respond to FT or whether the effect is simply a matter of difference in how much FT males and females are exposed to. Further work examining females with a larger range of FT levels is needed to better understand the sex-specific effects of FT exposure on later development. Second, the current work on hNSCs primarily shows how testosterone may have important actions on early neural development via conversion to DHT and action on the androgen receptor. However, future work could examine other routes of influence, such as aromatization of testosterone to estradiol and actions through the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, prior work has shown that the gene RORA is influenced by androgens and estrogens and can have further regulatory influence over aromatase levels and act to reduce estrogen levels [73]. RORA and aromatase levels are both reduced in frontal cortex in autism and are highly related to each other [73, 74]. This work suggests that routes of influence via the AR may be more likely implicated in autism. Nonetheless, future work should investigate the role of testosterone conversion to estradiol and actions via the estrogen receptor and how such mechanisms interact with RORA in autism.In conclusion, we find that variation in FT during midgestational periods of prenatal development has a sex-specific impact on later human brain development. In particular, FT reduces functional connectivity in adolescence between social brain DMN subsystems in males, but has no effect on DMN functional connectivity in females. This sex-specific influence in early prenatal development was modeled in hNSCs to discover how androgens may act as a transcriptional influence on genes that are highly relevant in the adult brain for specific DMN-related circuitry. Here, we discovered that DHT-dysregulated genes are enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and are highly enriched for genes that are spatially expressed in a similar pattern to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. These DHT-dysregulated and DMN-relevant genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a variety of synaptic processes and may affect excitation-inhibition balance. These affected processes are congruent with the idea that FT may exert fetal programming influence on genes that play roles in biological processes that are integral for later circuit formation and maintenance. DHT also plays a prominent role in dysregulating genes involved in many early neurodevelopmental processes such as neurogenesis, cell differentiation, patterning, and regionalization. This effect is compatible with the idea that androgens can affect genes that may have pleiotropic roles at early and later phases of brain development that link early cell proliferation and differentiation to later synaptic organization. MEF2C is one particular gene with such early and late developmental roles. MEF2C is also highly relevant to cortical midline DMN circuitry and is highly associated with male-biased conditions such as autism and intellectual disability. MEF2C is upregulated in hNSCs by DHT. In an important link with autism, we find similar MEF2C upregulation in iPS cells, but not neural progenitor cells or neurons from male cases of autism. This work highlights that prenatal androgens may have male-specific influence over early prenatal neurodevelopmental processes that can potentially manifest as long-lasting influence over social brain circuitry. These effects may help explain normative sex differences in brain and behavior as well as increased male-susceptibility to conditions such as autism.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary Results and FiguresThese authors contributed equally: Michael V.

Inflammation is involved in the development of both cancer and psychiatric disorders. The role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the subsequent risk of psychiatric disorders after cancer diagnosis is however unknown.MethodsWe performed a cohort study of all patients diagnosed with a first primary malignancy between July 2006 and December 2013 in Sweden. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of NSAID use during the year before cancer diagnosis with the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders during the first year after cancer diagnosis.ResultsAmong 316,904 patients identified, 5613 patients received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorders during the year after cancer diagnosis. Compared with no use of NSAIDs, the use of aspirin alone was associated with a lower rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 0.97), whereas the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs alone was associated with a higher rate (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.32), after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications for NSAID use, and cancer characteristics. The association of aspirin with reduced rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders was strongest for current use (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93), low-dose use (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), long-term use (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.94), and among patients with cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95) or breast cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.98).ConclusionPre-diagnostic use of aspirin was associated with a decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders during the first year following cancer diagnosis.KeywordsAspirinAnti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidalMental disordersNeoplasmshttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794CancerfondenCAN 2017/322FangFanghttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006636Forskningsrådet om Hälsa, Arbetsliv och Välfärd2017-00531FangFanghttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543China Scholarship Council201806240005HuKejiahttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925National Health and Medical Research CouncilGNT1147498SloanErica K.http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001026National Breast Cancer FoundationIIRS-20 to 025PF-15 to 014WalkerAdam K.SloanErica K.issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2020BackgroundPsychiatric disorders are common comorbidities among patients with cancer [1] and may contribute to increased morbidity [2] and mortality [3, 4] after cancer diagnosis. In a previous study, we reported a highly increased risk of common psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions, among cancer patients, especially during the first year after cancer diagnosis [5]. Underlying reasons for such increased risk may include a severe stress response after receiving cancer diagnosis [6–8] and psychiatric symptoms caused by cancer treatment [9, 10], pain [11], and inflammation [12, 13]. Inflammation in the tumor micro-environment drives tumor development and progression [14] and cancer patients have a high burden of cancer-induced systemic inflammation [15].Inflammation has been suggested to be involved in the development of depression [16] and other psychiatric disorders [17]. For instance, inflammatory cytokines have been shown to influence neurocircuitry in the brain through the consequence of neurotransmitter signaling [18], including a cascade of behavioral and immune responses that might lead to depression, anxiety [19], and PTSD [19, 20] among vulnerable individuals. Although the link between inflammation and psychiatric disorders has been less explored among patients with cancer, chronic inflammatory disorders have been reported to be risk factors for depression and anxiety among cancer patients [21].Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for pain and inflammation. The anti-inflammatory actions of NSAIDs include inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and prostaglandin synthesis [22]. Due to its non-competitive and irreversible acetylation of COX, aspirin is different from non-aspirin NSAIDs in terms of indications and adverse effects [23]. A recent meta-analysis of 26 relatively small randomized clinical trials suggested that NSAIDs play an antidepressant role in patients with major depressive disorder and are reasonably safe [24]. Preclinical studies indicate that the use of aspirin is associated with a lower risk of depression in the general population [25], and among patients with stroke [26] or osteoarthritis [27]. There is, however, a lack of evidence in this regard among cancer patients and on psychiatric disorders other than depression. Our recent preclinical study showed that low-dose aspirin might counteract the inflammation-related cognitive impairment in a mouse model of breast cancer [28]. It is therefore plausible that aspirin may help to prevent inflammation-related psychiatric disorders among cancer patients.To this end, we performed a nationwide register-based study in Sweden to investigate the role of pre-diagnostic use of NSAIDs, especially aspirin, in the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders following cancer diagnosis. Our hypothesis was that pre-diagnostic use of NSAIDs, especially aspirin, is associated with a decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders following cancer diagnosis, compared with no use of NSAIDs.MethodsStudy designFrom the Swedish Cancer Register [29], we identified 338,009 patients that were diagnosed with a first primary malignancy between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013. Through cross-linkages with the Swedish Causes of Death Register, Migration Register, and Patient Register, we followed these patients individually from the date of cancer diagnosis until death, emigration from Sweden, or 1 year after cancer diagnosis, whichever came first, using the Swedish personal identity numbers. We focused on the first year after cancer diagnosis because the risk of psychiatric disorders appears to be highest immediately after cancer diagnosis [5]. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had conflicting information (i.e., died or emigrated before cancer diagnosis) (n = 982), or were diagnosed at autopsy (n = 2336). Because we aimed at assessing the risk of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders, patients with preexisting depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorder before cancer diagnosis ascertained since 1973 onward according to the Patient Register [30] were also excluded (n = 17,787), leaving 316,904 patients in the final analysis (Fig. 1). We hypothesized the newly onset depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis might be more closely related to cancer-related inflammation and the psychological stress patients experienced after receiving a cancer diagnosis.
Fig. 1Flowchart of the study design. NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsPre-diagnostic use of NSAIDsWe linked the cohort of cancer patients to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which contains information on all prescribed medications that are dispensed in Sweden since July 2005 [31]. The vast majority of prescribed medications are subsidized with a celling of co-payment in Sweden. Medications are coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System in this register. We identified all records of NSAIDs (aspirin: N02BA01, N02BA51, B01AC06; non-aspirin NSAIDs: M01A) dispensed within 365 days before cancer diagnosis. Patients were then classified into the mutually exclusive categories “no use of NSAIDs,” “use of aspirin alone,” “use of non-aspirin NSAIDs alone,” or “use of both.” We also grouped the medications by cyclooxygenase selectivity. Aspirin, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, tolmetin, and oxaprozin were defined as COX-1 selective NSAIDs, whereas coxibs, meloxicam, etodolac, mefenamic acid, and diclofenac were defined as COX-2 selective NSAIDs. Nonselective NSAIDs and use of both categories were collapsed into an additional group.As aspirin is the most frequently used NSAID, and our animal study suggested its protective role in cognitive well-being in a mouse model of breast cancer [28], we specifically studied aspirin and categorized the use of aspirin according to recency of use, daily dose, and duration of use. Recency of use was defined by the time between cancer diagnosis and last dispensation during 365 days before cancer diagnosis, and classified as “previous use” if the last dispensation was more than 90 days before cancer diagnosis or “current use” if no more than 90 days. The information of daily dose was extracted from the prescription text, and a mean daily dose was calculated from the prescribed daily dose of each dispensation. The daily dose was then categorized as low (20–150 mg), medium (151–300 mg), or high (> 300 mg). Duration of use was defined as the number of days that patients were supplied with aspirin, as estimated by the total dispensed dose divided by the mean daily dose. We defined a patient as a long-term user if the estimated duration was 300 days or more (the median of all duration values). Possible regimens of aspirin use, combining information on recency, dose, and duration, were also examined.Post-diagnostic depression, anxiety, and stress-related disordersThrough the Patient Register, we identified all patients with an inpatient or outpatient hospital visit that resulted in a diagnosis of psychiatric disorders [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): F10-F99] during the follow-up (from date of cancer diagnosis until up to 1 year after cancer diagnosis). We then limited the analysis to three groups of psychiatric disorders that are common among cancer patients [32, 33] and potentially related to inflammation [34], including (1) depression disorders (ICD-10: F32, F33), (2) anxiety disorders (ICD-10: F40, F41), and (3) stress-related disorders, namely PTSD, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions (ICD-10: F43).CovariablesInformation on age at diagnosis, date of diagnosis, cancer type, and cancer stage was obtained from the Cancer Register. We studied the most common cancer types, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancer, skin cancer, kidney and bladder cancers, gynecological cancers, hematological malignancies, and other less common cancers including tumor of the central nervous system. Using the European Network of Cancer Registries Condensed TNM Scheme and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, we classified non-hematological malignancies as localized limited (T-localized/N0/M0 or FIGO 0-I), localized advanced (T-advanced/N0/M0 or FIGO II), regional spread (any T/N+/M0 or FIGO III), distant metastasis (any T/any N/M+ or FIGO IV), and unknown stage. “Mx” was regarded as “M0” because “Mx” is commonly used when there are no clinical indications of distant metastasis.We calculated chronic disease score based on the medications used during the year before cancer diagnosis, as a comorbidity measure [35, 36]. We excluded psychiatric medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and analgesics from this calculation because they are related to the outcome and exposure of interest in the present study. We also ascertained potential indications for NSAID use through the Patient Register and classified them as cardiovascular diseases (ICD-10: G45.9, I00–02, I05–09, I20–21, I30, I32–33, I38–40, I63, I65.2, I80–83, I88, Z95), inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions (ICD-10: M05–19, M45–46, M60, M65), inflammatory systemic diseases (ICD-10: M30–36), and pain and fever (ICD-10: F45.4, G43–44, G50.0–50.1, M25.5, M54.5, M54.9, M79.1, N94.4, R50.8–50.9, R51–52). We further linked the cohort to the Longitudinal Integrated Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA) [37] for ascertainment of various potential confounders, including educational level, occupation, region of residence (east, south, and north according to the first-level Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics), and marital status at cancer diagnosis.Statistical analysisWe described baseline characteristics of the cancer patients according to their levels of NSAID use. We calculated the incidence rates (IRs) of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders by diving the number of patients that received a diagnosis of such disorders by the accumulated number of person-years during follow-up. We then investigated the rate of the studied disorders in relation to the different levels of NSAID use using Cox proportional hazards models. In the Cox models, the “time to event” data were used by setting the date of cancer diagnosis (from the Cancer Register) as the time when an individual started being at risk for the outcome, the date of diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorder (from Patient Register) as the time of event, and the earliest date among death (from the Causes of Death Register), emigration (from the Migration Register), and 1 year after cancer diagnosis as the time of censoring if no event happened. We adjusted for age at cancer diagnosis, sex, calendar year of cancer diagnosis, educational level, occupation, place of residence, marital status, and comorbidity in model 1 and additionally adjusted for indications for NSAID use in model 2. We created one dummy variable per indication of NSAID use. In model 3, we further adjusted for cancer type and cancer stage. We first analyzed all studied disorders together and then analyzed separately depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. We then focused on aspirin and studied the effect of recency of use, daily dose, duration of use, and combined regimens of aspirin use. To calculate stratum-specific HRs, we fitted separate models for each level of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications for use, and cancer characteristics for aspirin use as well as for current, low-dose, and long-term aspirin use. To test for effect modification by these variables, we included interaction terms between NSAID use and these variables in the multivariable models and used Wald tests to test the statistical significance of the estimated interaction terms (for one exposure and one stratification variable at a time).Because patients with other psychiatric disorders might be more likely to use NSAIDs and at higher risk of studied disorders after cancer diagnosis, we performed a sensitivity analysis where cancer patients with any pre-existing psychiatric disorders before cancer diagnosis were excluded. Additionally, as patients with gastrointestinal symptoms might avoid the use of NSAIDs and might have a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders in general, we conducted another sensitivity analysis where we stratified the analysis by use of proton pump inhibitors, defined through at least two dispensations, within 1 year before cancer diagnosis. In all analyses, time since cancer diagnosis was used as the underlying timescale. We used Schoenfeld residuals to test the proportional hazards assumption for the main exposure (i.e., NSAID use) in all models and found no major deviation from the assumption.The statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4, SAS Institute and Stata, version 16, StataCorp LP. We used a two-sided P < 0.05 to indicate statistical significance.ResultsAmong the 316,904 patients included in the analysis, the median age at cancer diagnosis was 68 years and 53.4% were male. 58,761 (18.5%) of these patients used aspirin alone and 49,059 (15.4%) used non-aspirin NSAIDs alone during the year before cancer diagnosis (Fig. 1). Cancer patients who used aspirin alone were more likely to be male, older, less educated, were less likely to be working, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have a deceased partner, compared with patients who did not use any NSAIDs (Table 1). Compared with no users, aspirin users were more likely to have cardiovascular disease, whereas non-aspirin NSAID users were more likely to have inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis.

Compared with no NSAID use, the use of aspirin alone was associated with a lower rate of the studied disorders in all models (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.97 in model 3 with adjustment for sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications, and cancer characteristics) (Table 2). Similar results were found for depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders separately (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs alone was associated with an increased rate of the studied disorders (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1), compared with no NSAID use. We did not find an association between the use of both aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and the studied disorders. The sensitivity analyses showed similar results after excluding patients with any pre-existing psychiatric disorders (Supplementary Table S2) or after stratifying the analysis by use of proton pump inhibitors within 1 year before cancer diagnosis (Supplementary Table S3).

IRs were calculated by dividing the number of patients that received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders by the number of person-years accumulated during follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals in relation to exclusive NSAID use, using no use of NSAIDs as the referenceAbbreviations: PYs person-years, IR incidence rate per 1000 person-yearsaEstimates were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year of cancer diagnosis, educational level, occupation, region of residence, marital status, and Chronic Disease ScorebEstimates were additionally adjusted for potential indications for NSAID usecEstimates were additionally adjusted for common cancer types and cancer stage, as well as subtypes of hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasm)A lower rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, although not statistically significant, was suggested for use of COX-1 selective NSAIDs (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85–1.01) compared with no NSAID use (Supplementary Table S4). The use of COX-2 selective NSAIDs was associated with a higher rate (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15–1.38) of the studied disorders compared with no NSAID use. A combined use of COX-1 selective, COX-2 selective, and nonselective NSAIDs was associated with a moderately increased rate of the studied disorders.Recency, daily dose, and duration of aspirin useThe association of aspirin with reduced rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders was primarily noted among current users (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93), low-dose users (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), and long-term users (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.94) (Table 3). Among commonly combined regimens, individuals with a combination of current, low-dose, and long-term aspirin use had the lowest rate of the studied disorders after cancer diagnosis (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.87).

A total dispensed dose of aspirin, average daily dose, and number of days to be covered were calculated according to prescription text. Average daily dose was then categorized as low (20–150 mg), medium (151–300 mg), and high (> 300 mg) dose. Long-term users were defined as those who used aspirin for ≥ 300 days during the 365 days before cancer diagnosis. IRs were calculated by dividing the number of patients that received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders by the number of person-years accumulated during follow-up. Combined regimens across recency, dose, and duration were also examined. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from separate Cox proportional hazard models to assess the effect of recency, dose, and duration of use, as well as the six combined regimens of aspirin use, using no use of NSAIDs as the referenceAbbreviations: PYs person-years, IR incidence rate per 1000 person-yearsaEstimates were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year at cancer diagnosis, educational level, occupation, region of residence, marital status, and Chronic Disease ScorebEstimates were additionally adjusted for potential indications for NSAID usecEstimates were additionally adjusted for common cancer types and cancer stage, as well as subtypes of hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasm)Subgroup analysis and effect modificationThe magnitude of the inverse association of aspirin use alone with the rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders was greater among females than males, among patients who lived in the east of Sweden than patients who lived in other parts of Sweden, among patients with cardiovascular disease than patients without cardiovascular disease, and among breast cancer patients than patients with other cancer types (all P values for interaction < 0.05) (Table 4). The association did not, however, differ by calendar period of cancer diagnosis, age, educational level, marital status, occupation, comorbidity, other indications for NSAID use, or cancer stage.

Stratum-specific hazard ratios were estimated for each exposure by fitting separate Cox proportional hazard models for different levels of the stratification variable and are presented in different rows, adjusting for age, sex, calendar year at cancer diagnosis, educational level, occupation, region of residence, marital status, Chronic Disease Score, potential indications for NSAIDs, cancer type, cancer stage, and subtypes of hematological malignancies. To assess the interaction between the exposure and each stratification variable, multivariable models were fitted adjusting for the above covariates and including an interaction term for the exposure and each level of the individual stratification variable. P for interaction was then calculated through a Wald test of the null hypothesis that interaction parameter for the exposure and the individual stratification variable is equal to zero. P < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant interaction between the exposure and the stratification variableDiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this nationwide register-based cohort study is the first to examine the association of prior NSAID use with the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis. The study included all patients with newly diagnosed cancer in Sweden between July 2006 and December 2013 and found that aspirin use, especially long-term and low-dose use, shortly before cancer diagnosis was associated with a reduced rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders during the first year after cancer diagnosis. Non-aspirin NSAID use, on the other hand, was associated with a higher rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders.The different results for aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs are consistent with recent studies of depression in the general population [25] and among patients with stroke [26]. We further extended the knowledge to other common psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and stress-related disorders (namely PTSD, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions). The different results for aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs are also biologically plausible. Accumulating evidence supports the role of COX-1 inhibition in attenuating neuroinflammation, leading to protection against inflammatory brain damage [28, 38, 39]. In contrast, COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to augment nitro-oxidative and oxidative stress in the brain [40], and to interfere with the resolution of inflammation by decreasing the negative immunoregulator Prostaglandin E2 [41], thereby aggravate neuroinflammation. Consistent with this, selective COX-2 inhibitors have also been related to increased psychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, and changes in cognition [42]. Taken together, COX-1, rather than COX-2 inhibition, might be the key factor in blocking neuroinflammation [38]. Our findings that COX-2 selective NSAID use was associated with a higher risk of common psychiatric disorders compared with nonselective NSAID use also supports this hypothesis. Aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, particularly at a low dose [38]. As the majority of aspirin is used at low dose, the observed protective effect of aspirin on the studied disorders is likely driven by COX-1 inhibition. The null association of high-dose aspirin may on the other hand be due to additional inhibition of COX-2 [25]. In contrast, although non-aspirin NSAIDs have mixed selectivity, they are mostly selective for COX-2 inhibition or non-selective, possibly leading to the observed harmful effect of non-aspirin NSAIDs on these psychiatric disorders. This was however partly inconsistent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis that found celecoxib to have an antidepressant effect when added to traditional antidepressants [24]. One possible explanation for the contradictory findings might be the fact that we studied newly onset depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis whereas Bai et al. studied the treatment effort on prevalent depression [24].We further found that current, long-term, and low-dose aspirin use was associated with the lowest rate of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis. Current and long-term aspirin use reflects persistent anti-inflammatory activity, in addition to low-dose use with enhanced inhibition of COX-1. The stratified results by cancer stage showed clear evidence for an inverse association between aspirin and the studied disorders in most stages of cancer, apart from distant metastatic cancer. Furthermore, the effect of aspirin was more pronounced among females, in line with the proposed female-specific impact of low-dose aspirin in anti-inflammation [43]. The stronger association noted for females might alternatively be attributable to the stronger findings among breast cancer patients, which corroborates with our preclinical findings using animal models [28]. The underlying reasons for the stronger association among patients with breast cancer, compared with patients with other cancers, remain unknown. This finding, together with the fact that patients with breast cancer have indeed the highest prevalence of depression among patients of different cancer types [33], highlights a potentially specific role of inflammation in breast cancer-related depression [44].The strength of the study includes the nationwide population-based study design, independent collection of information on drug exposures and psychiatric disorders, the comprehensive information of covariables, and thorough statistical analysis including multivariable adjustments for potential confounders. Common systemic and random errors are therefore minimized. Some potential limitations of the study should, however, still be noted. The Prescribed Drug Register does not include information on medications used over the counter or in hospitals and nursing homes. We speculate however that this is non-differential between individuals that would later receive a cancer diagnosis and subsequently also a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders and individuals that would not receive a diagnosis of psychiatric disorders after being diagnosed with cancer. Such misclassification would therefore most likely have diluted the magnitude of the studied association. Also, this should not have affected the results on aspirin use greatly because low-dose aspirin is mostly prescribed in Sweden [45]. Further, because of its observational nature, residual confounding due to unknown and unmeasured confounders may exist. Patients with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder might be more likely to use NSAIDs and at higher risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis. We therefore excluded patients with any psychiatric disorders—in addition to patients with depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders—prior to cancer diagnosis and observed similar results. However, the exclusion of these patients was likely incomplete because not all patients with psychiatric disorders attend health care. Similarly, we investigated the role of gastrointestinal symptoms, which could indicate high stress levels and reduced NSAID use, by stratifying the analysis by use of proton pump inhibitors during the year before cancer diagnosis and found again similar results.ConclusionsAspirin use, especially current, long-term, and low-dose use, was associated with a decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders following cancer diagnosis, while the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk, compared with no use of NSAIDs. Our findings call for pre-clinical research in examining the underlying mechanisms of low-dose aspirin and depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders after cancer diagnosis and, if confirmed in further studies, provide a rationale for randomized clinical trials.Supplementary informationAdditional file 1: Table S1.

For some patients, their cognitive impairment may be transient, but for a subgroup, these symptoms can be long-standing and have a major impact on the quality of life. This paper describes the protocol for a study: (1) to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition via self-report, neuropsychological testing, peripheral markers of inflammation and neuroimaging and (2) to explore and describe patterns of cancer-related cognitive impairment over the course of treatment and recovery in patients with newly diagnosed, aggressive lymphoma undergoing standard therapy with curative intent.Methods and analysisThis is a prospective, longitudinal, feasibility study in which 30 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with aggressive lymphoma will be recruited over a 12-month period. Patients will complete comprehensive assessments at three time points: baseline (time 1, pre-treatment) and two post-baseline follow-up assessments (time 2, mid-treatment and time 3, 6–8 weeks post-treatment completion). All patients will be assessed for self-reported cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive function using Stroop Colour and Word, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Controlled Oral Word Association and Digit Span. Blood cell-based inflammatory markers and neuroimaging including a positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and CT (18F-FDG-PET/CT) and a MRI will explore potential inflammatory and neuroanatomical or functional mechanisms and biomarkers related to CRCI. The primary intent of analysis will be to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition using subjective reports and objective tasks from patients during treatment and recovery for lymphoma. These data will inform the design of a larger-scale investigation into the patterns of cognitive change over the course of treatment and recovery, adding to an underexplored area of cancer survivorship research.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been granted by Austin Health Human Rights Ethics Committee (HREC) in Victoria Australia. Peer reviewed publications and conference presentations will report the findings of this novel study.Trial registration numberAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619001649101).lymphomaadult neurologydelirium & cognitive disordersOlivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research CentrePhD Supportive care research scholarshipCelgene Pty LtdNon-restricted educational grantspecial-featureunlockedStrengths and limitations of this studyWe have developed a workable schedule of assessments to support the collection of multiple sources of information that will help characterise and understand the nature of cognitive changes over the course of treatment and recovery.We have been able to develop processes and procedures to accommodate the rapidity with which treatment has to commence and the intensity of treatment.We may be limited in our ability to achieve exploratory aims; this, of course, will be dependent on the success of recruitment, compliance with assessments and attrition.IntroductionCancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a recognised and adverse consequence of cancer and its treatment1–5 and can occur in up to 75% of patients.1 2 For some people cognitive impairment may be transient, but for a subgroup these symptoms can be long-lasting after treatment, drastically impacting on the quality of life and ability to function.4–7
Aggressive lymphomas, including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and grade 3b follicular lymphoma, account for 15% of all haematological malignancies, with approximately 1500 new cases across Australia annually.8 Current treatment paradigms consist of intensive combination chemotherapy which achieves durable remissions in 65%–95%, and potential cure in approximately 50% of patients.9 Younger age at diagnosis and a favourable prognosis have resulted in a growing population of survivors of aggressive lymphoma at risk of long-term toxicity.10
Although persistent changes in cognitive function are reported among lymphoma survivors,7 11 the majority of CRCI studies have focused on women with breast cancer, alongside a smattering of studies assessing other or mixed tumour groups.6 12 13 Even those studies dedicated to haematological malignancies to date, have been limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous populations and therapeutic interventions, plus cross-sectional design.11 Although studies have assessed objective neuropsychological functioning in people with haematological malignancies,14–19 few have included people with aggressive non-central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Many lack consistency in measures of cognitive symptoms, ranging from self-reporting to various objective testing methods,17 18 and the majority use cross-sectional evaluation at the end of therapy with no pre-treatment cognitive data reported.2 This is an important gap in the literature given the long life expectancy of young adults with aggressive lymphoma, where impaired cognition may have a dramatic impact on function, quality of life, work, learning capacities and many aspects of social life.7
Clinical and preclinical studies have implicated inflammation in the pathophysiology of CRCI in non-CNS solid tumours, and in response to chemotherapy in these populations.20–24 It is plausible that peripheral inflammatory signatures may provide insight regarding individuals at risk of developing CRCI or serve as a useful diagnostic tool.25 Structural differences in the brain have also been identified in patients with solid tumours using brain imaging.26–35 However, there is no longitudinal data investigating either of these biomarkers in newly diagnosed aggressive non-CNS lymphoma.In 2006, the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (ICCTF) was established. Subsequently. it developed recommendations for a core set of neuropsychological tests, standard criteria for deﬁning cognitive impairment and cognitive changes, and approaches to improve the quality of study methodology.36 As 30% of people have been shown to have lower than expected cognitive performance prior to cancer treatment,37 the ICCTF strongly recommends longitudinal studies with repeated measures, including a pretreatment baseline assessment and comparison to a non-cancer control group.38
The feasibility of collecting comprehensive longitudinal cognitive data including self-report, neuropsychological assessment, biomarkers and brain imaging over the course of treatment and recovery in patients with newly diagnosed aggressive non-CNS lymphoma undergoing standard treatment with curative intent is currently unknown and potentially challenging. Establishing feasibility in people with suspected aggressive lymphoma as they undergo an urgent comprehensive diagnostic workup and rapid commencement of chemotherapy is an important goal. Nonetheless, a longitudinal exploration of the pattern of CRCI over the course of treatment and recovery has not been described in this population and is an important precursor to the development of supportive care services.For the first time, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal comprehensive assessment using repeated measures of cognition in patients with non-CNS aggressive lymphoma as supported by International guidelines.38 At the completion of this study, we will understand the feasibility of conducting a comprehensive longitudinal study on CRCI in this population to describe patterns of CRCI over time. This novel study will address a deficit in the evidence, before embarking on a large-scale study to comprehensively describe the cognitive outcomes and trajectory of this cohort of patients.AimsThis study has two main aims. The first is to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition using self-report and objective assessments in people with newly diagnosed, aggressive lymphoma undergoing standard therapy with curative intent.The second is to explore and describe patterns of CRCI in the population of interest as measured by self-report, neuropsychological assessment, peripheral markers of inflammation and neuroimaging.ObjectivesThe primary feasibility objectives are to: estimate the recruitment rate to the study; describe reasons for ineligibility; assess retention of participants at follow-up assessments; assess compliance with scheduled neuropsychological assessments; assess compliance with patient-reported study measures at scheduled assessments; assess the acceptability of study measures as reported by participants; assess the practicability of blood collection; estimate the proportions of patients who are willing to have positron emission tomography (PET)/CT brain acquisition studies at each assessment; estimate the proportions of patients who have scheduled PET/CT brain acquisition studies; estimate the proportions of patients who are willing to have MRI scans at each assessment and estimate the proportions of patients who have scheduled MRI scans.Exploratory objectives relate to the assessment of changes in measures of cognition over time. Relevant objectives are to: describe changes in neuropsychological functioning from baseline at follow-ups; changes in self-report cognitive functioning from baseline at follow-ups; changes on PET/CT brain scans from baseline at follow-ups and, changes on MRI scans from baseline at follow-up.MethodsDesign and settingThis single-site longitudinal, feasibility study will be conducted in the specialised haematology department of a comprehensive cancer centre in a large acute tertiary hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia.ParticipantsThirty newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with aggressive lymphoma undergoing curative-intent combination chemotherapy will be recruited over a 12-month period. Each participant will be followed up to 6 months from enrolment.EligibilityThe study will enrol people aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma (HL, DLBCL, Burkitt lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma or grade 3b follicular lymphoma); scheduled to undergo standard combination chemotherapy with curative intent; able to read and comprehend English; with a documented Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <3.Exclusion criteria include lymphomatous CNS involvement; prior or planned cranial radiotherapy and a life expectancy of <12 months; any medical condition that may compromise adherence or lead to prolonged hospitalisation; a documented history of past or current substance abuse, or poorly controlled psychiatric illness.Sample sizeThe target sample of 30 participants is pragmatic. If 30 patients are accrued in 12 months, the expected monthly accrual rate is 2.5 patients per month with a 95% CI of 1.7–3.6 patients per month; the corresponding CI for the accrual rate over 12 months is 20.2–42.8 patients (confidence limits calculated in R V.3.5.1 using the ‘epitools’ package).39
ProceduresConsented participants will undergo comprehensive assessments, including neuropsychological testing, self-report questionnaires, blood cell-based inflammatory markers and neuroimaging at three pre-specified time points. Time 1 (T1): pre-treatment (treatment naïve), time 2 (T2): mid-treatment (that is after cycle 2, and before cycle 3 of chemotherapy) and time 3 (T3): 6–8 weeks post-treatment completion.The neuroimaging (18F-FDG PET/CT brain acquisition study and MRI scan) will be offered as an optional substudy. The brain MRI substudy will occur in the first 15 participants willing to participate at two time points only (T1 and at T3). The flow of participants through the study is described in figure 1.Figure 1Schematic diagram of the study design.

Treatment detailsChemotherapy regimens, including agents delivered, dose-intensity, duration and number of cycles, as well as amendments to planned treatment, will be collected from the participants medical record.Neuropsychological assessmentStandard neuropsychological testing will be used to assess cognitive domains of memory, information processing speed, verbal fluency, attention and executive function. Table 1 depicts the domains assessed and tests used. These tests cover the cognitive domains most commonly impaired in cancer survivors, are widely used, validated and include those recommended as part of a core battery of tests by the ICCTF.38 Normative data for each neuropsychological test are available for comparison to determine similarities or differences between the lymphoma group and a healthy population.Table 1Cognitive domain assessed and the neuropsychological tests usedDomains assessedTestsExecutive functionStroop Colour and Word42

The Stroop colour and word test measures executive function, based on the observation that individuals can read words much faster than they can identify and name colours.42 The Trail Making Test is an assessment of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The test can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning and is sensitive to detecting cognitive impairment.43 The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test assesses verbal memory and involves participants being asked to remember a list of 12 words with three semantic categories. Three learning trials are followed by an unprompted delayed recall and a 24-word list in which participants are asked which words are the target words and which are distractors.44 The Controlled Oral Word Association test is a verbal fluency test measuring spontaneous production of words belonging to the same category or beginning with the same designated letter.45 The Digit Span Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale measures auditory focused attention and working memory by having the participant repeating back number sequences of increasing length in the same order or in reverse order.46
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)A set of self-report measures will be used to assess cognitive functioning, fatigue and emotional distress. All measures are appropriate for use in cancer populations and have evidence supporting their measurement properties.47
Subjective cognitive functioning will be assessed with The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life questionnaire for cancer (QLQ-C30) Cognitive functioning scale (EORTC QLQ-C30 CF),48 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Cognitive Function scale (FACT-COG)49 and The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ).50
The 2-item EORTC QLQ-C30 CF assesses the extent to which participants have experienced each cognitive condition (attention and memory) within the last week. Respondents use a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘0’ (Not at all) to ‘3’ (Very much) to rate each item. Item review involved patients and psychometric evidence support its use in patients with cancer.48 51 Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 0–6) and higher scores reflect higher levels of cognitive condition.The 37-item FACT-COG assesses perceived cognitive functioning including mental acuity, attention and concentration, memory, verbal fluency, functional interference, deficits observed by others, change from previous functioning and impact on the quality of life within the last week. Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘0’ (Never) to ‘4’ (Several times a day) to rate each item. Item generation and review involved patients and oncology specialists and psychometric evidence support its use in patients with cancer.52 The FACT-COG includes negatively worded (eg, I have had trouble concentrating) and positively worded (eg, My mind is as sharp as it has always been) items. Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 0–148). Negatively worded items are reverse scored to create subscale scores, with higher scores reflecting fewer cognitive problems and better quality of life, consistent with the FACT scoring system.53
The 25-item CFQ assesses the frequency at which participants have experienced cognitive failures, such as absent-mindedness, everyday life-slips and errors of perception, memory and motor functioning in the past 6 months. It will be completed at two time points only (T1 and T3) and will provide data on self-reported capacity in the 6 months leading up to diagnosis, through treatment and into recovery. Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘0’ (Never) to ‘4’ (Very often) to rate each item, and psychometric evidence support its use in patients with cancer.50 54 Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 0–100) with higher scores indicating higher levels of cognitive failures.Fatigue is strongly associated with self-reported cognitive declines and is considered a contributor to decline in cognitive function.55 Fatigue will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale (FACT-Fatigue). This 13-item questionnaire used with the 28-item FACT-G quality of life instrument assesses the intensity and impact of fatigue on daily life in the last 7 days. Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘0’ (Not at all) to ‘4’ (Very much) to rate each item. Item generation and review involved patients and oncology specialists and psychometric evidence supports its use in patients with cancer.56 Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 0–52), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of fatigue. We have healthy normative data collected using the FACT-G questionnaire in an Australia population available for comparison.Depression and anxiety have been associated with CRCI, thus these outcomes will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Emotional Distress-Depression 8b and-Anxiety 7a short forms.57 The 7-item PROMIS Anxiety 7a short form will assess the frequency of emotions such as fear, stress and anxiety in the last 7 days. Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘1’ (Never) to ‘5’ (Always) to rate each item. Item review involved patients and psychometric evidence supports its use in patients with cancer.58 Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 36.3–82.7), and higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety.The 8-item PROMIS Depression 8b short form will assess the frequency of emotions such as worthlessness, hopelessness and sadness in the last 7 days. Respondents use a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‘1’ (Never) to ‘5’ (Always) to rate each item. Item review involved patients and psychometric evidence supports its use in patients with cancer.58 Responses are summed to create a total score (possible range: 35.2–82.4), and higher scores reflect higher levels of depression.Average testing time is 10–12 s per item on each questionnaire, giving a total time per assessment for all questionnaires of 25 min.Participant burden interview (initial pilot)In addition to neuroimaging requirements, it is anticipated study measures may take between 60 and 70 min to complete. It is important to explore the acceptability and feasibility of this set of measures in a population for whom there is no reported data of acceptability for this battery of tests. We will therefore ask the first five participants enrolled to describe their experience of completing the assessments, including time commitment, repetition of measures, burden and recommended changes. This brief, face-to-face interview using a semi-structured interview schedule, will take place 1 week after the participants have completed the T1 self-report measures and neuropsychological testing.Laboratory testsWe hypothesise that inflammatory markers in the blood are positively associated with CRCI. As an initial exploration of this association, we will use full blood examination (FBE) counts that are inexpensive and standard of care in treating patients with lymphoma. These include:Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR).Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR).Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII).Participants will have blood tests collected as part of standard care. This will occur prior to each cycle of chemotherapy, and at the end of therapy to ensure blood count recovery. The blood cell-based inflammatory markers will be calculated from readily available results of FBE. These data will be available at each of the three time-points. The NLR and PLR will be calculated as the ratio of neutrophil count to lymphocyte count, and as the ratio of platelet count to lymphocyte count, respectively. The SII will be defined as platelet count times the NLR.25
We recognise that lymphoma and cancer treatment can modify NLR, PLR and SII, and other markers of inflammation such as CRP, ESR or cytokine analysis may show a stronger association between inflammation and CRCI. However, these markers are not always included in the standard of care assessment in patients with lymphoma. The aim of this study is to explore whether standard of care blood cell counts may serve as a cost-effective biomarker for CRCI that requires no additional labour or tests.Neuroimaging substudyNeuroimaging will be performed using both 18F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT and MRI examinations to explore potential structural and functional changes associated with CRCI.18F-FDG PET/CT brain acquisition study: a dedicated brain acquisition study will be undertaken to explore changes in glucose metabolism and signs of acute metabolic effects at all three time points. As it is an optional sub-study, it will be undertaken with the subset of participants willing to take part. The whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scans will be performed as standard of care. As part of this scan, an additional 10 minute brain PET emission scan, 30 min post-injection and a low dose head CT will be acquired.Consenting participants will be assessed on the same PET scanner (Philips Ingenuity scanner), in the hospital’s Molecular Imaging department. The brain PET emission scan will not expose participants to additional radiation above the standard of care whole-body PET emission scan. The low dose brain CT scans (for localisation and attenuation correction of PET emission scan) will include low additional radiation exposure to participants. Based on the estimated dose, the level of risk is described as very low, and is within an allowable annual dose to the public from controlled sources.59
MRI scan: an MRI scan of the brain will be performed to explore changes in regional cortical volumes. This will be performed only in the first 15 patients who consent to the MRI sub-study, at two time points only (T1 and T3), due to the costs of the scans.Consenting participants will be imaged on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Skyra) with a 64-channel phased-array head coil in the radiology department. The MRI acquisition will include 3D magnetisation prepared - rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) T1, 3D fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. A T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetisation prepared rapid gradient echo (T1 MP-RAGE) sequence with 1 mm isotropic voxels will be used for structural/morphometric analyses. FLAIR images will be used for quantitative measures of white matter (WM) hyperintensity burden.MP-RAGE images will be acquired with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)=2300 ms, echo time (TE)=2.98 ms, field of view (FOV)=256 mm, fractional anisotrophy (FA)=9°, number of slices=192, 1.0 mm thickness, 256×256 matrix, in plane resolution of 1.0 mm2. 3D FLAIR sampling perfection with application optimised contrasts using different flip angle evolution (SPACE) will be acquired using the following parameters: TR=5000 ms, TE=391 ms, FOV=256 mm, number of slices=192, 1.0 mm thickness, 256×256 matrix, in plane resolution of 1.0 mm2. DTI acquisition will be conducted using a whole brain two-dimensional spin-echo sequence with an echo-planar readout and a pair of diffusion weighting gradients positioned symmetrically around the 180° pulse.60 DTI parameters: TE=92 ms, TR=2400 ms, 30 axial slices interleaved with 4 mm slice thickness, field of view=220 mm, voxel size 1.7×1.7×4.0 mm. Diffusion gradients will be applied along 64 non-collinear directions with a b value of 1000 s/mm2; one non-diffusion-weighted set of images will be acquired.Data analysisFeasibility outcomesThe main feasibility outcomes are recruitment, retention, compliance with study measures, as well as acceptability and practicability of subjective and objective study measures. Recruitment data will be summarised using a rate and 95% CI using the Poisson distribution. Compliance with assessments, as well as adherence and retention data, will be summarised using a proportion and 95% CI; the latter will be estimated using the Wilson method.61 Relevant analyses will be performed in R.Acceptability of the assessments will be explored through one-on-one, face-to-face, semi-structured participant burden interviews in the first five participants. Content analysis will be used to analyse the responses and identify recommendations for modifications to improve the acceptability of study assessments.62
Patient characteristics, patient-reported outcomes and neuropsychological test outcomesAnalysis will include all available data and will be performed in R. Responses to patient-reported outcome measures and neuropsychological tests will be scored according to author guidelines. Values for missing measures and tests will not be imputed.Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise patient characteristics and missing data. Descriptive statistics will include counts and percentages, and means and SD or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate.Continuous patient-reported and neuropsychological test outcomes will be summarised descriptively (means and SD) at each time point. Changes from baseline at follow-up time points will also be analysed descriptively (means and SD). Effect size estimates (ie, standardised measures of change from baseline; in this case, mean change divided by the baseline SD), as described by Kazis et al
63 will be used to characterise the size of observed differences. If appropriate, a secondary analysis of continuous patient-reported and neuropsychological test outcomes will be carried out by fitting a linear mixed model to each outcome separately using the ‘lmerTest’ package.64 Models will be estimated via maximum likelihood and include a fixed effect for time and a random participant effect.NeuroimagingWe will be using a Tukey-Kramer HSD test to establish longitudinal changes in regional tracer uptake as well as in cortical volumes and thickness over the course of the treatment and recovery. False discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons will be performed on the regional comparisons and correlations.18F-FDG PET/CT brain acquisition study analysis: all brain study scans, and MRI image sets are aligned using CapAIBL.65 Standardised uptake values (SUV) will be calculated for all brain regions examined and SUV ratios (SUVR) will be generated by dividing all regional SUV by the cerebellar cortex SUV. Neocortical glucose hypo-metabolism will be expressed as the average SUVR of the mean of frontal, superior parietal, lateral temporal, lateral occipital and anterior and posterior cingulate regions. We will also compute the frontal and anterior cingulate SUVRs and the FDG posterior cortical index as the average SUVR of the lateral temporal, parietal and posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices.Voxel-wise analyses: Statistical brain mapping (SPM8) strategies66 will be used to analyse the variation of the continuous PET measurements during treatment and recovery on a voxel-by-voxel basis, thus providing regional information that is independent of any pre-specified cortical region. Difference in SUVR images between the different PET scan visits will first be computed. We will then perform straightforward SPM on the difference SUVR images to define the pattern of tracer retention changes over the course of treatment and recovery.MR analysis: Volumetric estimates (hippocampus, cortical grey matter (GM), WM and ventricular volumes), expressed in cm3, will be obtained from T1 MP-RAGE images using computational quantification of MRI from AIBL (CurAIBL).67 CurAIBL implements an Expectation Maximisation approach for the segmentation of GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid, and a segmentation propagation approach to define smaller regions of interest (ROIs) including hippocampus and ventricles. The hippocampus ROI is extracted using a multi-atlas approach based on the Harmonised Hippocampus Protocol.68 Cortical volumes will be corrected for intracranial volumes.Once pure tissue segmentation and partial tissue classification are performed, the cortical thickness estimation of the resulting GM will be computed using a combined voxel-based approach. Cortical thickness will be estimated in the anterior middle frontal gyri, in the cerebellum and in the posterior parietal cortex.Patient and public involvementThis study explores the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition in patients with newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma. However, no patients or members of the public were included in the design of the study. The results will be disseminated to participants after the study on request, which will be completed by the study team. The participant burden interview will not be analysed by patients themselves, but inclusion of the burden interviews speaks to this limitation as they will generate patient feedback on feasibility of the study.DiscussionFor the first time, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal comprehensive assessment using repeated measures of cognition in patients with newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma undergoing standard therapy with curative intent. At the completion of this study, we will understand feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition, and will describe patterns of CRCI in the population of interest as measured by self-report, neuropsychological assessment, peripheral markers of inflammation and neuroimaging.This novel study will address a deficit in the evidence, to inform the planning of a larger-scale longitudinal cohort study, to comprehensively describe the cognitive outcomes and trajectory of this cohort of patients, and ultimately lead to intervention studies in the future.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval was granted by the Austin Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) approval number HREC 55582/Austin-2019. The study is registered at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. The trial is open to patient recruitment. Participants will not be exposed to any undue risks or harm by participation. The estimated risk of the additional radiation exposure from the neuroimaging is classified as very low risk and covers the allowable annual dose to the public from controlled sources. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.69
We anticipate the study will be completed in April 2021 and report results in 2021–2022. Future publications and presentations will explore feasibility outcomes and patterns of cognitive function over time in this cohort of patients, and relationships between outcomes.Supplementary MaterialReviewer commentsAuthor's manuscriptContributors: PG contributed to the literature reviews and study design, was involved in all aspects of protocol and the overall preparation and writing of the manuscript.

The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalising on a unique longitudinal dataset that includes in-vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI, we show that this developmental period is characterised by brain-wide growth in MT, within both gray matter and adjacent juxta-cortical white matter. In this healthy population the expression of common developmental traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these MT trajectories in fronto-striatal regions. This reduction is most marked in dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity, and in lateral and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. The findings highlight that psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally specific reduction in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain development.IntroductionStructural brain development extends into adulthood, particularly so in regions that mediate higher cognition such as prefrontal cortex1. A canonical view is that this maturation is characterised by regional shrinkage in gray matter (GM) coupled to an expansion of white matter (WM)2. However, the underlying microstructural processes remain obscure. Two candidate mechanisms are proposed3, namely synaptic loss (pruning) that reduces supernumerary connections, and an increase in myelination that serves to enhance communication efficiency. Both accounts receive a degree of support from cross-sectional and ex-vivo studies4–7. What is also known is that there are substantial inter-individual differences in these growth trajectories8, with the most marked changes occurring within an age window where an emergence of psychiatric illness is increasingly common9,10. This raises a possibility that this enhanced psychiatric risk is tied to altered maturational brain trajectories during this critical developmental period11,12.Compulsivity and impulsivity are two important symptom dimensions in psychiatry13 that also show substantial variation in expression within a healthy population (Supplementary Fig. 1a-f). At the extreme these axes can manifest as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) respectively. Macrostructural and cross-sectional studies suggest a link to changes in fronto-striatal regions13–16, but leave unanswered the question of whether compulsivity and impulsivity reflect consequences of altered developmental microstructural processes.Here we used semi-quantitative structural MRI17 to investigate the microstructural brain development during a transition into adulthood, specifically asking whether individual variability in these developmental brain trajectories is linked to the expression of compulsive and impulsive traits. We used a novel magnetic transfer saturation (MT) imaging protocol to provide an in-vivo marker for macromolecules, in particular myelin18,19. Importantly, MT saturation has been shown to be a more direct reflection of myelin compared to other imaging protocols, such as magnetization transfer ratio20,21. It is also sensitive to developmental effects7. This renders it ideal for tracking patterns of brain maturation in longitudinal studies involving repeated scanning of participants, a crucial necessity for a full characterisation of development22. Using such a protocol, we show that during late adolescence and early adulthood cingulate cortex expresses the greatest myelin-related growth, both within gray and adjacent white matter. Individual differences in compulsivity are reflected in a reduced rate of this growth particularly within dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal regions. This contrasted with impulsivity, which was associated with reduced myelin-related growth in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that within an otherwise healthy population heterogeneity, compulsivity and impulsivity traits reflect regionally distinct differential growth in myelin growth trajectories.ResultsOngoing myelin-related growth at the edge of adulthoodTo assess developmental trajectories of myelin-sensitive MT we exploited an accelerated longitudinal design that included repeated scanning in 288 (149 female) adolescents and young adults aged 14–24 years, up to three times in all, with an average follow-up time of 1.3±0.32 years (mean±SD) (1 scan: N=100, 2 scans: N=167, 3 scans: N=21). The sample was gender balanced and comprised of otherwise healthy subjects (excluding self-reported illness a priori to avoid illness-related confounds, such as medication effects) who were selected to be approximately representative of the population (cf online methods for details).Examining individual, ongoing maturation using whole-brain voxel-based quantification analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b) in gray matter revealed a brain-wide increase in myelin-related MT, with a strong emphasis within cingulate, prefrontal and temporo-parietal areas (Fig. 1a, p<.05 false-discovery rate [FDR] peak corrected; merging cross-sectional and longitudinal effects, mean change in GM (±SD): 0.58±0.19% per year; max z-value voxel [z=6.78, p<.002 FDR] in right angular gyrus [MNI: 51 -46 44]: 0.98% per year; cf. Supplementary Table 1 for parametric and non-parametric results; separate cross-sectional and longitudinal effects shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a-b). These developmental changes were accompanied by increased MT in adjacent (juxta-cortical) superficial white matter with a similar topography to that seen in gray matter (Fig. 1b, mean change: 0.47±0.18% per year; max z-value voxel [z=6.18, p<.004 FDR] in posterior cingulate [5 -58 56] with 0.89% per year; cf. Supplementary Table 1), consistent with the idea that connections within gray and white matter are myelinated in concert (correlation between neighbouring gray-/white-matter voxels: Pearson r=0.25, permutation p<0.001; cf. online methods). Similar, albeit less pronounced, microstructural maturation was observed in subcortical gray matter nuclei including amygdala, ventral and posterior striatum, pallidum and dorsal thalamus (Fig. 1c, mean change: 0.29±0.06% per year; max z-value voxel [z=5.12, p<.004 FDR] in amygdala [25 4 -23] with 0.5% per year). These findings highlight that myelin-related MT development in both cortical and subcortical areas is a marked feature of a transition from adolescence into adulthood, and conforms to a pattern that is suggestive of involvement of both local and inter-regional fibre projections.Association between macro- and microstructural developmentThe observed developmental expansion of myelin-sensitive MT expressed overlapping topographies with macrostructural gray matter shrinkage (with the exception of hippocampus) and white matter expansion (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 4a-c and Supplementary Table 2 for macrostructural results). This raises a question as to how precisely macrostructural volume change relates to development of our myelin marker MT. A positive association in white matter volume (Fig. 2b-c; mean±SD: r=0.09±0.05, t=453, p<e-15) supports the notion that myelination is linked to the observed macrostructural volume changes, as predicted by an assumption that increased myelination leads to a white matter volume expansion23. The relatively modest, but consistent, effect size is partially explained on the basis that we only investigate the purely developmental associations and controlled for potentially confounding effects. However, our findings leave open a possibility that there might be additional microstructural factors driving the change in white matter macrostructure.Voxel-wise analysis in gray matter revealed a more complex association between macrostructural development and myelination (Fig. 2b-c). We observed that the association is dependent on where a voxel is located in the tissue. An overall profile of consistently negative correlations (albeit relatively small) in gray matter zones close to the white matter boundary (0-2mm from GM/WM border: t=300, p<e-15) suggest that developmental myelination may lead to a ‘whitening’ of gray matter, which in turn is likely to drive partial volume effects evident in a shrinkage of gray matter volume23,24. This means that a gray matter volume decline in deep layers during adolescence may well be driven by an increase in myelination within these same areas. This negative association was reduced with increased distance from the white matter boundary (Pearson r=0.3, p<e-15, Fig. 2c, bottom right panel). This suggests that ongoing myelination in superficial layers (i.e. close to the outer surface of the brain) contributes to an attenuated volume reduction and implies that developmental macrostructural change is the result of complex microstructural processes.Compulsivity linked to reduced development in cingulate, dorsolateral and striatal MTWe next asked whether individual differences in the expression of symptoms, indicative of obsessive-compulsive traits, were associated with distinct developmental trajectories in myelin-sensitive MT growth. We employed a dimensional approach exploiting a heterogeneity within this otherwise healthy community sample. We computed a compound-score (first principal component, Supplementary Fig. 1a-f) from the two established obsessive-compulsive symptom questionnaires25,26 available in our sample in order to aggregate a common score to index meaningful variation (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1). Top loading items on this score (subsequently called ‘compulsivity’) reflect compulsive behaviours, such as checking, and it was strongly aligned with total scores on our obsessive-compulsive questionnaires (Pearson correlations r>.8).Assessing how compulsivity related to individual myelination over time, we found our compulsive measure was linked to altered MT growth primarily in frontal areas, with significant clusters in dorsolateral (superior frontal gyrus, GM: z=4.87, p=.009 FDR, [-23 34 49], WM: z=4.28, p<.05 FDR, [-24 -4 64]) and dorsomedial (anterior mid-cingulate, GM: z=4.1, p=.009 FDR, [18 1 58], WM: z=3.74, p<.05 FDR, [-25 1 37]) frontal cortices (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 3), both in cortical gray and adjacent superficial white matter. Importantly, more compulsive subjects showed reduced MT growth compared to less compulsive subjects. A similar pattern was seen in the left ventral striatum (z=3.9, p=.018 FDR, [-22 14 -9]) and adjacent white matter (z=4.2, p=.027 FDR, [21 -9 25], Fig. 3b). Intriguingly, the locations of reduced MT development were spatially centred in cingulate and ventral striatum, and this regional focus aligns with a specific fronto-striatal loop described in primate anatomical tracing27 studies. This alignment with a well described anatomical circuit suggests compulsivity may relate to attenuated myelin-related developmental growth in this cingulate-striatal loop13.Reduced inferior prefrontal maturation trajectories in impulsivityWe next examined whether a common heterogeneity in impulsivity (as assessed using the well-established Barratt impulsiveness questionnaire total score; cf Supplementary Fig. 1f) is linked to individual growth of the myelin marker. In examining this linkage we opted to use a questionnaire measure over task-based measures of impulsivity because the former have been found to be more reliable (cf 28–32 for detailed discussion; stability subsample in this study33 [N=63], BIS total: re-test reliability Pearson r=.76 for 1 year follow-up, reflection impulsivity decision parameter34: r=.16 for 6 months follow-up), reflecting a stable trait more likely to be linked to structural development. We found impulsivity was associated with reduction in adolescent MT growth with a strong focus on frontal areas, encompassing lateral (including inferior frontal gyrus, IFG; GM: z=1.65, p=.031 FDR, [-48 13 -4], WM: z=4.38, p=.015 FDR, [-27 39 -2]) and medial prefrontal areas (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 4; GM: z=4.13, p=.031, [15 58 18], WM: z=3.69, p=.015, [-12 47 20]), both within gray and adjacent white matter (subcortical effects in Supplementary Fig. 5a).The above finding suggests that while impulsivity and compulsivity are both linked to reduced myelin-related growth in prefrontal areas, these alterations have their peak expression in distinct anatomical regions (cingulate and dorsolateral vs inferior later and medial prefrontal cortex, for direct comparison cf. Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, both compulsivity and impulsivity showed a reduced growth in the anterior insula (Supplementary Fig. 6), possibly expressing a common, transdiagnostic vulnerability.We next investigated development-independent levels of myelination in impulsivity, indicating myelin-related differences that emerged before the commencement of our study. This is important because a pre-existing ‘hyper-myelination’ with the reduced ongoing growth would suggest a normalisation during adolescence, whereas a ‘hypo-myelination’ prior to adolescence onset would imply that a deficient myelination was further accentuated during adolescence. We found a main effect of impulsivity evident in hypo-myelination across several, primarily anterior prefrontal, brain areas including IFG (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Figure 5b, Supplementary Table 5). An overlap between these baseline effects and areas showing a reduced ongoing growth suggests that for impulsivity a gap in myelination may exist prior to adolescence, with this gap is widening further during a transition into adulthood. The same effects were found when analysing across the entire prefrontal cortex, where a reduced MT growth was linked to both compulsivity (t(421)=1.99, p=.047) and impulsivity (t(421)=-2.80, p=.005), but where a developmental, baseline hypo-myelination in impulsivity (t(474)=2.30, p=.022) is further accentuated during late adolescent development (no such effect was found for compulsivity: t(427)=1.03, p=.30, Supplementary Figure 7a-b).Lastly, we examined how MT change related to the development of impulsivity traits. Although we did not see age-related change in impulsivity across the entire group, there was substantial variability within individuals (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1). We thus investigated whether myelin growth in IFG, a key region previously implicated in impulsivity15, related to ongoing changes in impulsivity. We found that a change in IFG MT was negatively associated with impulsivity change (Pearson r=-.27, p<.0003, Fig. 4d), indicating that individuals with the least ongoing myelin growth had a worsening impulsivity over the course of the study (irrespective of other covariates, such as baseline impulsivity or age). Similar effects were also seen in prefrontal cortex when using a voxel-wise analysis (cf. Supplementary Figure 7c).DiscussionMyelin enables fast and reliable communication within, and between, neuronal populations35,36. Using a longitudinal, repeated-measures, MRI scanning design in a developmental sample, we provide in-vivo evidence that myelination extends into adulthood as evident in a pronounced myelin-related whole-brain MT growth. We find that the macrostructural growth pattern closely resembles that expressed in our myelin marker. The positive association between these measures in white matter suggests that macrostructural volume change is, at least in part, driven by myelination. In gray matter, depth-dependent associations suggest that macrostructural volume reduction in adolescence is the result of multiple microstructural processes. In superficial layers, ongoing myelination seems to attenuate the impact of a pruning effect, leading to an apparent slowing in gray matter volume decline. In deeper layers, close to the gray-white matter boundary, ongoing myelination appears to contribute to an inflated estimate of volume reduction, with a myelin-induced ‘whitening’ of gray matter resulting in a misclassification of gray matter voxels (i.e. partial volume effects23), leading to an apparent volume reduction. This observation extends on recent cross-sectional studies that report age-related myelin increases in deep layers7,24 and implies that developmental neuroimaging that avail of markers sensitive to specific microstructural processes17 can provide more precise accounts of the likely mechanisms underlying adolescent and early adult brain development.Critically, we found that individual differences in myelin-related MT growth during development is linked to common heterogeneity in compulsivity and impulsivity within an otherwise healthy sample. Both compulsivity and impulsivity were associated with a reduction in MT growth, and this reduction was almost exclusively present in fronto-striatal areas. In compulsivity, MT growth reduction was primarily expressed in dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal regions as well as ventral striatum, whereas impulsivity was more tightly linked to reduction in lateral and medial prefrontal growth. It is worth noting that variability in compulsivity/impulsivity does not reflect clinical impairment in this healthy sample37. Our findings extend on previous animal and patient studies that implicate lateral and medial prefrontal regions in attention-related functions38 and ADHD15,39. It is also noteworthy that the regions implicated in compulsivity are reported to show altered function in OCD40,41 and constitute prime targets for invasive OCD treatment interventions42,43. Critically, our findings of a reduced myelin growth linked to compulsivity suggest that differences in brain structural variables may not prevail during childhood (or only to a minor extent), but emerge during adolescence as a result of aberrant developmental processes.Embracing a longitudinal developmental approach, as in this study, poses distinct developmental questions. In relation to impulsivity and compulsivity, we can ask how a stable trait is related to longitudinal change as well as baseline myelination differences, where the latter is more indicative of influences emerging prior to recruitment into our study. In the case of impulsivity, we found that ongoing growth occurred in similar regions that also express a difference in baseline myelination, advocating the presence of a pre-existing myelination gap in impulsivity that further expands during adolescence. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying impulsivity have long-lasting effects on brain development, possibly affecting myelination trajectories before adolescence onset with lasting effects into adulthood.An extension of the approach outlined above poses the question as to how ongoing change in compulsivity and impulsivity relate to ongoing brain maturation (i.e. correlated change). Strikingly, we found that IFG growth change was indicative of change in impulsivity. Subjects who showed worsening of their impulsivity were also those who showed the least maturational myelin-related growth in IFG. Thus, during the transition into early adulthood even though impulsivity traits as a whole do not change at a population level, individual psychiatric risk trajectories show meaningful variation, and this in turn is reflected in specific patterns of brain maturation.In our study, we adopted a broad definition of impulsivity and compulsivity traits yet found links to myelin growth. This suggests reduced myelin-related growth in these areas may represent a developmental feature shared across multiple cognitive and/or genetic endophenotypes. This also implies that a more refined cognitive endophenotyping might yield spatially more defined developmental effects44–46. Compulsivity and impulsivity showed little overlap in our sample and this relative independence was also reflected in their impact on distinct fronto-striatal brain regions (with the exception of insula which showed a common growth reduction). These data leave open the possibility of a genetic pleiotropy, meaning that a shared genetic factor may drive both myelination and impulsivity/compulsivity, without a direct causal influence between brain and trait expression47. However, our correlated change finding that ongoing myelination in the IFG is directly related to how impulsivity evolves over time advocates for the possibility of a direct relationship between myelin-related maturation and impulsivity.Variability in trait dimensions, such as compulsivity and impulsivity are often related to other variables known to affect brain structure. We examined how potential confounding factors, such as subject movement during scanning (Supplementary Figure 8a-f), alcohol consumption45,46, recreational drug use, socio-economic status, intelligence (between subject differences and within-subject changes, Supplementary Fig. 9a-c) or ethnicity affected the link between compulsivity/impulsivity and MT growth. Importantly, none of these factors accounted for the observed effects (Supplementary Figure 9d).A challenge for human neuroscience is to determine the cellular mechanisms that underlie macrostructural change in-vivo
48. This has particular importance for developmental neuroscience where longitudinal, repeated-measures, approaches are critical for understanding brain development22. Our focus in this study on a magnetization transfer (MT) saturation protocol as a proxy for myelin content is rooted in evidence of its sensitivity to myelin and related macromolecules17, as well as the fact this measure is more robust to instrumental biases20. There is also evidence for a strong relationship between MT and myelin as measured in histological studies18,19 and we have shown previously that MT is linked to myelin gene expression7. Our longitudinal findings extend the importance of MT as a myelin marker with relevance for individual differences. We show myelin-related effects are expressed in both cortical gray and adjacent white matter, but more pronounced in the former as found also in ex-vivo studies4. Taken together our findings suggest that MT is an important, albeit imperfect, indicator of myelin.The transition into adulthood is a particularly vulnerable stage for the emergence of psychiatric illness10. Our findings suggest variability in the expression of compulsivity and impulsivity is tied to ongoing microstructural brain development. The brain’s potential to dynamically adjust its myelination49, for example as a function of training50, points to the potential of interventions that target specific deviant trajectories. Such interventions might offer a novel therapeutic domain to lessen a developmental vulnerability to psychiatric disorder.Online MethodsStudy design & participantsThe NSPN study33 used an accelerated longitudinal design to investigate variability in compulsivity and impulsivity traits and brain maturation during adolescence and early adulthood. Participants were recruited in London and Cambridgeshire from schools, colleges, primary care services and through advertisement. Subjects were sampled in six age bins 14-15y, 16-17y, 18-19y, 20-21y, and 22-24y, with roughly balanced numbers (overall age mean (std) 19.45 (2.85) years). Each age bin was balanced for sex and ethnicity (relative to the local population). From the 2406 participants that took part in the study and which filled out socio-demographic information and questionnaires at least once, 318 healthy subjects (~60 subjects per age bin) participated in the MRI arm. Subjects with self-reported pervasive neurological, developmental or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the recruitment. After rigorous visual quality control and excluding 10% of scans with highest during-scan motion (cf. Supplementary Fig. S8 for details) of all 558 processed imaging datasets, 61 scans from 30 subjects had to be discarded due to severe artefacts. We finally analysed 497 available brain scans from 288 (149 female) healthy individuals that passed rigorous quality control. In particular, data from 100, 167, and 21 subjects with one, two or three visits per person were available, with mean (standard deviation) follow-up interval of 1.3 (0.32) years between first and last visit. The study was approved by the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (12/EE/0250) and all participants (if <16y also their legal guardian) gave written informed consent.Assessing compulsivity and impulsivityTo examine the effects of compulsivity and impulsivity traits on myelin development, we analysed psychometric questionnaires that were handed out to the participants over the course of the study. A detailed description of the assessment waves and the overall structure of the NSPN study is provided elsewhere33. As an index of impulsivity, we used the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)51 total score, a well-established and calibrated measure of general impulsivity. To assess compulsivity, we built a composite score (using principal component analysis (PCA), cf supplementary information) from two established obsessive-compulsive questionnaires that were available in this study (Supplementary Fig. 1a-e, revised Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, OCI-R26, and revised Padua Inventory, PI-WSUR25).Questionnaires were assessed at several times throughout the study. BIS was completed at home by participants on up to three occasions (ca 1 year between assessments), with the first assessment wave taking place before initial scanning. PI-WSUR was also completed at home during waves 2 and 3. OCI-R was assessed on the day of the second MRI scan. Per construction, the considered psychometric questionnaires aim at measuring stable subject-specific traits but cognitive constructs could as well change over the course of this longitudinal study. In our sample, linear mixed-effects modelling (LME, cf supplementary information) revealed that both indices did not substantially change during the study period while accounting for covariates and confounds, which motivated our use of aggregated scores (LME intercepts) for most of the subsequent MRI analyses on impulsivity. Compulsivity and impulsivity trait measures showed a weak (Pearson) correlation r=0.119 in the large behavioural sample, supporting a notion of rather independent dimensions (less than 1.4% shared variance, cf Supplementary Fig. 1).MRI data acquisition and longitudinal preprocessingBrain scans were acquired using the multi-echo FLASH MPM protocol52 on three 3T Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio MRI systems located in Cambridge and London. Comparability between scanners was assessed prior to study onset (for more details, cf 33) and differences between scanners were accounted for by adding scanner as covariates in our analyses. Isotropic 1mm MT maps were collected to quantify local changes in gray and adjacent white matter and all image processing was performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), the h-MRI toolbox for SPM53,54 (www.hmri.info), Computational Anatomy toolbox (CAT, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/) and custom made tools (cf code availability statement).Magnetization transfer saturation (MT) maps provide semi-quantitative maps for myelin and related macro-molecules, and correlate highly with myelin content in histological studies18,19. MT shows a high sensitivity to actual microstructural changes such as myelin and thus overcomes limitations in previous methods, such as diffusion tensor imaging, which measure microstructural change only indirectly through assessing diffusivity55. It was also found to be more robust than earlier protocols such as magnetization transfer ratio20. This is important also because myelin patterns are defining for brain anatomy and are used for subdividing brain structures56,57.Since longitudinal neuroimaging is prone to artefacts due to registration inconsistency, scanner inconsistencies and age-related deformations of the brains, we developed advanced processing pipelines in order to detect the changes of interest and achieve unbiased results. To assess the microstructural myelin-related MT changes during development, we used a longitudinal processing pipeline with the following steps (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To normalise images, we performed a symmetric diffeomorphic registration for longitudinal MRI58. The optimization is realized within one integrated generative model and provides consistent estimates of within-subject brain deformations over the study period and a midpoint image for each subject. The midpoint image is subsequently segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid using CAT. MT maps from all time-points were then normalized to MNI space using geodesic shooting59,60, spatially smoothed preserving GM/WM tissue boundaries54, and manually as well as statistically quality checked using a proxy for during-scan motion (cf. Supplementary Fig. 8) and covariance-based sample homogeneity measures (as implemented in CAT). Lastly, we constructed masks for both gray and adjacent white matter using anatomical atlases for subsequent analysis (cf. illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2b).To relate these quantitative (Voxel-Based Quantification, VBQ) to more conventional metrics (i.e. Voxel-Based Morphometry), we normalized tissue segment maps to account for existing differences and ongoing changes of local volumes using within- and between-subjects modulation. The obtained maps were spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM). All analyses were conducted in voxel-space, and then projected onto surface space for illustration purposes. Voxel-wise result maps can be inspected online (cf data availability statement).In this paper, we focused on the developmental VBQ analysis of myelin-sensitive MT. Since this is the first longitudinal study with this marker, effects of demographics (time/visits, age and sex) as well as impulsivity and compulsivity were considered on the whole-brain level. The analyses were particularly aimed at exploring MT in gray matter and the adjacent superficial white matter tissue. In order to define disjunct but adjacent gray and white matter regions for voxel-based analysis in the MNI template space, the gray and white matter tissue classes of the template were thresholded with 0.5, resulting in an approximately symmetric GM/WM boundary, i.e. with roughly 0.5 probability for each tissue class for voxels on the boundary (shown in Fig. 2). The resulting (non-overlapping) canonical gray and white matter tissue masks are not expected to be biased towards either gray or white matter and thus avoid over- or underestimation on both tissue classes. The subcortical gray and white matter masks were computed analogously.Longitudinal design specification, MT image, and statistical analysesIn this study, we employed a longitudinal observational design to examine myelin-related MT development in late adolescence and early adulthood. Traditional cross-sectional approaches employ between-subject measures to study age-related differences rather than within-subject changes. These can be affected by biases61, such as cohort differences62,63 or selection bias64, and typically require additional assumptions, such as (a) the age-related effect in the sample is an unbiased estimate of the group level average of individual within-subject effects of time or (b) all subjects change in the same way. Here, we follow recent analysis recommendations65, taking the advantage of the accelerated longitudinal design in which we study separately (in one joint model) (a) how the individual brain changes over time/visits (from baseline to follow up(s)) and (b) how it varies with mean age of different subjects in the study, and their interaction. To do so, we used the accurate and efficient Sandwich Estimator (SwE)65 method for voxel-based longitudinal image analysis (http://www.nisox.org/Software/SwE; cf supplementary information). Similar to common cross-sectional general linear modelling (GLM) approaches, this so-called marginal model describes expected variability as a function of predictors in a design matrix, while additionally accounting for correlations due to repeated measurements and unexplained variations across individuals as an enriched error term (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2b),In our developmental analyses, we focused on the factors time/visits and mean age of the individual (over all visits). Moreover, in order to investigate if, and how, compulsivity and impulsivity traits are related to brain trajectories and altered growth we enriched the models by adding a main effect of trait (compulsivity/impulsivity), as well as their interaction with change over time/visits. The latter metric allowed us to assess how MT growth is associated with compulsivity and impulsivity traits (e.g., lower MT growth in high compulsives), whereas the former indicates how a trait relates to overall MT differences across individuals, independent of all other covariates (time, mean age of a subject over all scans, sex, etc.). Unless specifically mentioned, all analyses were performed in a dimensional manner using the subjects’ trait scores directly rather than comparing median-split groups. Notably, in addition to including effects time/visit, mean age of subject (further denoted age_mean), and compulsivity/impulsivity traits, all models were tested for indications of effects of (a) other relevant demographic factors, especially sex and socioeconomic status (as measured by national poverty index66); (b) effects of during scan motion as indicated by standard deviation of R2* exponential decay residuals in white matter areas (cf. supplementary methods and Supplementary Fig. 8a-c); (c) non-linearites (accelerations/deceleration) of brain changes (across the study age range) and age-related trajectories, especially using time by age_mean interactions, and quadratic/cubic effects of age_mean; and (d) all first order interactions among all previous covariates. All image analyses, if not reported differently, were based on one-sided Wald-tests implementing the research questions (such as hypothesized developmental growth or trait-related impairment) described above. More detailed notes on longitudinal modelling and design specification can be found in supplementary information.There were no indications of substantial nonlinearities for myelin-sensitive MT (cf Supplementary Fig. 3d), but for volumes (cf Supplementary Fig. 4b). Demographic covariates and confounds (motion, total intracranial volume, scanner, socioeconomic status) were included in all models, and additional interactions of covariates were included when showing significant effects. This is intended to account for potential confounding effects of residual head size variations induced by tissue-weighted smoothing of quantitative MT analysis during morphometric analysis. Additionally, this allows utilisation of a consistent design (and power) across modalities. We additionally examined the effects of potentially confounding covariates, such as alcohol consumption, recreational drug use, ethnicity (‘white’ vs ‘other’), and IQ, but did not find any effect on our main results (cf. Supplementary Fig. 9d). We controlled for the False Discovery Rate (FDR) during corrections for multiple comparisons in all image analyses. We additionally report bootstrapping-based results (cf. Supplementary Fig. 2c; Supplementary Tables 1 & 3-5). We illustrate local trajectories using model predictions based on parameters and data averaged in 6mm spheres around peak effects. These model predictions are focussed on specific effects of interest (e.g. study visit or impulsivity) while the data is shown adjusting for effects of no-interest (e.g. other covariates and confounds, c.f. illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 4b).To examine the topographical similarity of growth effects in gray and adjacent white matter, we assessed the correlation between GM and nearest neighbouring WM voxels (significance tested using 1000 permutation tests).The sample size was conceived by NSPN consortium during the design of this study based on the developmental studies that were available at the time33. We used normalisation procedures (z-scoring and boxcox-transformation) for the psychometric data to align with the normality assumptions of our tests. In addition, all qMRI image analysis were additionally examined using sampling methods that do not assume normality of data distributions to allow valid inference. Our study had an observational design and no randomization of subgroups was used. Our study design also implied that data collection and analysis were not performed blinded.Analysis of macrostructural changes and MT/Volume associationsTo relate the findings from our microstructural myelin marker (MT) to traditional macrostructural markers (GM/WM volume), we performed analogue analyses (using VBM67) as described above on traditional normalized tissue segment maps. To quantify how developmental changes of macro- to microstructural parameters correlate, we specified a multi-modal SwE model including all volumetric and MT scans in a joint (block-diagonal) design matrix with all covariates separately for each modality. Developmental effects within each modality are defined by respective time/visit and age_mean beta estimates of those regressors of the design matrix. After SwE model estimation, the posterior covariance of these beta parameters from volume and MT modalities were calculated and transformed into correlation (see Fig. 2b).Assessing wide-spread effects of compulsivity and impulsivityTo assess the effects of development and compulsivity/impulsivity on myelin-sensitive MT across the entire frontal lobe (GM, WM separately), we used linear mixed-effects modelling (LME, cf supplementary information). Besides assessing the effects of time/visit and time by (continuous) trait interactions, we calculated the model predictions over the study period while accounting for covariates68. Random-effect intercepts were included and proved optimally suited using likelihood ratio tests. Global frontal MT was analysed separately for each dimension (shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a) and jointly with both dimensions (and their interaction) included in the design (Supplementary Fig. 7b). For both of these global models, we used discrete (median split bivariate traits: low vs. high) for simplified illustration although continuous variables were used during modelling.Analysis of correlated changes of brain and impulsivityTo assess whether MT development was related individual changes in impulsivity, we conducted a hypothesis-driven analysis of the bilateral IGF (anatomically defined). This LME analysis provides information about whether changes in impulsivity also reflect how quickly a brain region myelinates during the study period. The LME model used IFG MT, rates of change in IFG MT, time, their interaction, as well as the above introduced covariates as fixed effect to predict the dependent variable impulsivity score. We visualize the observed correlated changes using simple correlations. In addition, we conducted exploratory voxel-wise correlated change analyses. Time-varying BIS scores were decomposed in purely within- and between-subject components and entered as regressors in voxel-wise SwE modelling of myelin-sensitive MT (in addition to covariates time/visits, age_mean, sex, interactions and confounds, cf. supplemental information).Analysis of MT peak effect specificity for both traits and compulsivity subtestsAbove described voxel-based SwE analysis assessed whether there is region-specific growth in myelin-sensitive MT and compulsivity and impulsivity related impairment of the ongoing myelination process. However, here we complemented this by a subsequent analysis of MT in observed fronto-striatal peak effects (Fig. 3 and 4) and global frontal MT using LME modelling. More specifically, we were interested in specificity of local brain trajectories associated with each or eventually both impulsivity and compulsivity traits. The fixed effects design was specified with X = [intercept, time/visit, time by trait interaction, trait, age_mean, sex, socioeconomic status, confounders] (similar to the mass-univariate SwE models above). We explored the potential interaction of both dimensions, in addition to the separate modelling (presented in Fig. 3 & 4) a joint model was specified including both traits simultaneously, as well as their interaction (not found to be significant), and their respective interactions with time/visits. By inclusion of both effects of trait as well as their time by trait interaction, we accounted for potential baseline and rate-of-change differences related to both trait dimensions simultaneously rendering coefficients/statistics specific for each dimension. Random effects were restricted to intercepts. The specificity of MT (averaged in 6mm sphere around peaks observed in voxel-based SwE analysis above) for compulsivity and impulsivity is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. Finally, we assessed the specificity of two available compulsivity scores, OCI-R and PI-WSUR for the observed reduced MT growth effects using our compulsivity dimension (from PCA). Thus, we explored each subscore’s main effect and time/visit interactions on local MT trajectories (in averaged in 6mm spheres of peaks presented in Fig. 3a) as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 5c.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary MaterialReporting SummarySuppl Information Suppl tablesSuppl figuresAcknowledgmentsA Wellcome Trust Cambridge-UCL Mental Health and Neurosciences Network grant (095844/Z/11/Z) supported this work.

AnalysisThird EditionChapman and Hall/CRC2013Figure 1Developmental growth of myelin-sensitive MT into early adulthood.Transitioning into adulthood is characterised by marked increases in a myelin marker within cortical gray (a), white (b) and subcortical gray matter (c). Statistical maps of voxel-wise MT saturation show increase with time/visit (longitudinal) or age (cross-sectional; for specific effects of covariates, e.g. time/visit, age, sex, interactions etc., see supplementary information). (a) Gray matter MT increase (top row; statistical z-maps from one-sided Wald-test, p<.05 FDR corrected, sampling-based correction reported in Supplementary Table 1, cf Supplementary Fig. 2c, n=497/288 scans/subjects, 51.7% female, sample and test apply for panels a-c) is strongest in parietal, lateral temporal, posterior and middle cingulate, but is also present in prefrontal cortex. Longitudinal model in angular gyrus peak (mean across a 6mm sphere; coloured lines in left data plot; x-axis: relative time of scan) and adjusted data (uncoloured) shows an MT growth in both sexes, with a marked sex difference reflecting greater MT in females (see Supplementary Fig. 3c for region-specific sex differences). Corresponding cross-sectional model predictions in the same region show a similar increase with age (right data plot; y-axis: MT; x-axis: mean age over visits). (b) MT growth in adjacent cortical white matter is most pronounced in cingulate and parieto-temporal cortex with a coarse topographical correspondence to the gray matter MT effects. (c) Subcortical gray matter nuclei express MT age effects in striatum, pallidum, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus (cf Fig. 2a-b). This growth is most pronounced in amygdala, ventral (max z-value voxel [z=4.81, p=.004 FDR], [MNI: 20 13 -11]) and posterior (z=4.47, p=0.004 FDR, [MNI: -31 -19 3]) striatum suggesting ongoing myelin-associated changes in both cortical and subcortical brain structures.Figure 2The relation between macrostructural and microstructural brain development.(a) Coronal sections through prefrontal (left panels), striatal (middle) and thalamus/hippocampus (right; MNI: y=15, 12, -14) show more myelin-related MT in white than in gray matter with a clearly preserved white-gray matter boundary (top row, model intercept/mean, n=497/288 scans/subjects, 51.7% female, sample applies for panels a-b, all beta parameters shown for illustration of effect sizes, for statistical tests see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Developmental change in MT (second row, averaged beta parameter of age and time/visit effects) illustrating the rate of change of our myelin marker in both tissue classes, with faster increase in gray matter areas. Developmental change in macrostructural brain volume (third row, averaged beta parameter of age and time/visit effects) shows a characteristic cortical shrinkage (blue colours) in gray, but an expansion in core and frontal white matter (red colours; cf Supplementary Fig. 4). Only hippocampal gray matter shows an opposite effect with continuing volume growth up to the verge of adulthood. (b) Association between microstructural myelin growth and macrostructural volume change. A positive association throughout whole-brain white matter supports the notion that myelination contributes to white matter expansion. In gray matter, a predominantly negative association in deep layers points to partial volume effects at the tissue boundary and positive associations in superficial layers (correlation was obtained from posterior covariance of beta parameters in sandwich estimator model simultaneously including longitudinal observations of both imaging modalities, unthresholded). (c) Association as a function of Euclidean distance to GM/WM boundary. Both tissue classes show consistent increase of MT (top row, Pearson’s correlation with distance and two-sided p-values from corresponding t-distribution based on n=336164/118502 voxels in cortical gray/white matter), but opposite macrostructural volume change (middle row). Association between micro- and macrostructural growth is positive in white matter, rather independent of distance to GM/WM. In gray matter, the mean association changes from negative in deep layers (i.e. myelin MT change associated with reduced gray matter volume) to more positive associations in superficial layers (i.e. MT associated with a tendency to more gray matter volume).Figure 3Compulsivity is related to altered fronto-striatal MT growth.Longitudinal developmental change of our myelin marker is reduced in high compulsive subjects. (a) Aggregate compulsivity score is related to decreased MT increase in dorsolateral frontal gray matter (upper panel; statistical z-maps, p<.05, FDR and bootstrapping corrected; Supplementary Table 3, one-sided Wald-test, n=452/246 scans/subjects and test apply for panels a-b with available compulsivity, 50.4% female) and adjacent white matter, as well as cingulate cortex (lower panel; blue colours depicting negative time by compulsivity interactions). Subjects with higher compulsivity scores (light yellow) compared to low scoring subjects (dark red) express significantly less MT increase over visits (coloured lines in right panel indicate the interaction effect; y-axis: MT; x-axis: time of scan in years relative to each subject’s mean age over visits). (b) The above slowing in cortical myelin-related growth is mirrored by a decreased developmental growth in subcortical ventral striatum (left panel) and the adjacent white matter (right panel). These findings indicate young people with high compulsive traits express slower maturational myelin-related change in a fronto-striatal network comprising cingulate cortex and ventral striatum.Figure 4Decreased frontal growth in myelin-sensitive MT in impulsivity.Myelin marker (MT) in frontal lobe is linked to impulsivity traits. (a) Impulsivity is associated with reduced growth of MT in lateral (inferior and middle frontal gyrus), medial prefrontal areas, motor/premotor and parietal areas in both gray (top panel) and adjacent white matter (bottom panel) depicting negative time/visit by impulsivity interactions (z maps, statistical z-maps, p<.05 FDR and bootstrapping corrected, Supplementary Table 4, one-sided Wald-test, n=497/288 subjects/scans, apply for panels a-c, 51.7% female). (b) Plot shows subjects with higher impulsivity (light yellow) compared to low scoring subjects (dark red) express significantly less MT growth over visits (coloured lines in right panel indicate the interaction effect; y-axis: MT; x-axis: time of scan in years relative to each subject’s mean age over visits). (c) More impulsive subjects show a local decrement in baseline myelin marker (peak middle frontal gyrus, p<0.05, FDR and bootstrapping corrected, Supplementary Table 5) in lateral and orbitofrontal areas (fixed for other covariates, e.g. time/visits, mean age of subject, sex). Right panel shows the plot of MT in this peak voxel over impulsivity (x-axis, z-scored) and with adjusted data (gray/black) and model predictions (red/orange, effects of interest: intercept, impulsivity, sex by impulsivity). (d) Bilateral IFG not only shows a reduced myelination process for higher impulsivity (as shown in a, b), but this reduced growth rate is more strongly expressed in subjects who manifest an accentuated impulsivity growth over study visits, such that subjects who manifest an even more restricted growth in myelin become more impulsive (Pearson’s correlation and p-value from corresponding t-distribution based on n=188 independent subjects with available follow-up scans)."

Here, we show that the chemoagent paclitaxel induces memory impairment and anhedonia in mice within 24 h of treatment cessation, but inflammation is not present until 2 weeks after treatment. We find no evidence of brain inflammation as measured by cytokine analysis at any time point. Furthermore, treating with aspirin to block inflammation did not affect paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. These findings suggest that inflammation may not be responsible for memory impairment induced by paclitaxel. These results contrast with recent findings of a causal role for inflammation in cancer-induced memory deficits in mice that were prevented by treatment with oral aspirin, suggesting that cognitive impairment in cancer patients undergoing treatment may arise from multiple convergent mechanisms.cancercognitive impairmentmemoryinflammationanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)IntroductionCognitive impairment and mood disturbance are widespread in cancer patients and survivors who have received chemotherapy. Colloquially called “chemobrain”, up to 70% of cancer patients report noticeable deficits in learning, memory, executive function and concentration after chemotherapy, and up to 40% have measurable cognitive decline (1–4). Roughly 20% of cancer patients experience mood-related disturbances including anxiety and depression (5). In many survivors these symptoms are sustained for months or years after cessation of treatment (6, 7). While the clinical phenomenon of chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment and mood disorders has been widely characterized across a number of chemotherapies and different cancer populations, the biological mechanisms responsible for these symptoms remain elusive. A primary hypothesis proposed to account for sustained cognitive impairment and mood-related disorders is that chemotherapy drives peripheral inflammation that is propagated to the brain to induce neuroinflammation, thereby driving changes in cognition and mood. This “inflammation hypothesis” has been supported by findings of cognitive and mood symptoms in cancer patients and survivors that correlate with increases in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios during and after chemotherapy (6, 8). However, other studies have failed to find any association (3, 9). Such a hypothesis is plausible given the known relationship between peripheral inflammation, brain inflammation and disturbances in cognitive function, mood and behavior in non-cancer contexts (10–16). Given that numerous studies have identified an increase in proinflammatory cytokines in response to chemotherapy, it is not surprising that inflammation would be considered a candidate mechanism (17–19).If inflammation is causal in chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and mood disorders, then prophylactic and sustained treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs would be a potential intervention strategy to prevent these symptoms in cancer patients. We have previously reported that the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin prevents tumor-induced cognitive impairment in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer (11), suggesting its potential to be given to patients prior to chemotherapy to reduce cognitive impairment induced by the cancer. To date, no one has tested the utility for aspirin to combat chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. Here we determine if aspirin may also serve to alleviate chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. We test the immediate and sustained impact of a commonly employed chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, on memory performance and depression-like behavior in non-tumor bearing mice, and examine the inflammatory profile of these 24 h after the last dose of paclitaxel and 2 weeks later. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used treatment for multiple cancer types including breast, ovarian, lung, bladder, and prostate cancer that has been associated with symptoms of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in cancer patients (20, 21). Paclitaxel has also been shown to alter plasma inflammatory cytokines in patients (22). Consistent with those clinical observations, we show evidence of peripheral inflammation, as indicated by increased plasma cytokines 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment, but no evidence of elevated cytokines in the brain at any time point. The findings suggest that inflammation may not be responsible for either the immediate or late effects of paclitaxel on cognition, and confirm that aspirin is an unlikely intervention strategy to prevent or treat paclitaxel-induced chemobrain.Materials and MethodsAnimalsExperiments used BALB/c male (n = 52) mice aged 13–14 weeks (Monash University, Australia). Mice were individually housed in standard shoebox cages in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment with a 12/12-h modified dark-light cycle (lights on at 1900 h). Food and water were available ad libitum. Mice were handled daily for 2 weeks prior to the start of the experiment. Mice were euthanized with CO2 either 24 h after cessation of paclitaxel treatment or 2 weeks later to examine biological markers corresponding to early vs. late effects of chemotherapy. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and tissues were removed after perfusion with sterile PBS and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All procedures involving mice were carried out under protocols approved by the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee and in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council animal ethics guidelines. All experiments were conducted Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences except for assessment of brain cytokine gene expression, which was conducted at Neuroscience Research Australia.TreatmentsPaclitaxel TreatmentMice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg paclitaxel (Assay Matrix) solubilized in vehicle (Cremorphor EL:ethanol:saline, 1:1:10) or an equivolume of vehicle every second day for 2 weeks.Anti-Inflammatory TreatmentBALB/c mice were treated with either aspirin in drinking water (Aspro, Bayer Australia Ltd) (0.125 µg/ml) or water (control) starting 24 h prior to the first injection of paclitaxel and continuing until the end of the experiment. Water was changed daily and liquid consumption quantified. Mice were pre-determined to drink an average of 4 ml/day of aspirin-treated and non-aspirin-treated water resulting in an estimated dose of 25 mg/kg/day for mice treated with aspirin. This dose produces a similar pharmacodynamic effect on COX-1 inhibition as a dose of 100 mg/day in humans, which is considered a low dose (23).Behavioral AssaysSickness behavior, memory and depression-like behavior were assessed in response to treatment with paclitaxel. To ensure mice received adequate access to aspirin throughout the entire experiment, only sickness and memory was assessed in response to aspirin in drinking water.SicknessThe effect of paclitaxel on sickness and inactivity was assessed by measuring body weight changes, daily burrowing, and locomotor activity. The burrowing test was performed daily at 0900 as described previously (11). A PVC tube filled with 200 ± 1 g of standard mouse chow pellets was placed into the home cage for 30 min. The food pellets remaining in the tube after 30 min were weighed and used to calculate the burrowing activity as a percentage using the formula:200g−amount of food pellet left (g)200g×100Mice were trained to burrow at least 80% of the pellets (160 g) prior to the start of paclitaxel treatment.Locomotor activity was assessed by placing mice in a 40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm testing arena and recorded for 5 min in complete darkness under infrared lighting. Distance travelled was analyzed using Viewer III software (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany).Cognition and Mood TestingEpisodic memory was assessed using the novel object/novel place recognition test. Novel object/novel place recognition was conducted under low lighting, as previously described (11). The novel object/novel place recognition test was performed in a testing arena (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) 24 h after the termination of paclitaxel treatment and 13 days later. This test comprises of 3 different phases—acquisition, retention, and the test phase. During the acquisition phase, mice were allowed to explore two identical objects for 5 min. Mice were then removed from the arena and placed back into their home cage for 5 min (retention phase). During the test phase, mice were returned to the arena with one of the original now-familiar objects replaced with a novel object (with similar dimensions), placed in a novel location in the arena. BALB/c mice have been shown to perform poorly on the novel object recognition test compared to other strains. BALB/c were chosen to align with previous studies demonstrating cancer-induced memory impairment for which inflammation was shown to be causal and preventable with aspirin (11). Pilot studies indicated that a retention phase of 5 min provides optimal novel object/novel place preference in BALB/c mice while allowing deficits in memory from chemotherapy to be reliably observed. Mouse exploratory behavior, including time spent exploring both old and novel objects and distance travelled, were recorded and analyzed using Viewer III software (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany). Novel object recognition was calculated by determining the percentage of time spent with the novel object divided by the total time spent exploring all the objects in the arena. Mice were excluded if they spent less than 20 s exploring the familiar objects in the acquisition phase. As the same cohort of mice were used in the test at both time points (24 h and 13 days after paclitaxel), different objects were used between these tests to ensure novelty of the objects to mice.Working memory was assessed using the Y-Maze spontaneous alternation test and was conducted 24 h after novel object/novel place recognition testing (i.e. 48 h after paclitaxel and 11–13 days thereafter) under dim lighting. Mice were placed in the middle of a three-arm Y-Maze (20.5 cm × 11.5 cm × 32 cm; h × w × l) and were allowed to explore all three arms freely for 5 min. The experiment was recorded by camera and the number and sequence of arm entries were scored manually. Arm entries were only scored when all four limbs of the mice entered the arm. The percentage of correct alternations was calculated using the following formula:Number of correct alternations (consecutive entries into three different arms)total possible correct alternations (i.e., total arm entries−2)×100All mice achieved >60% alternation at baseline.Depression-like behavior was assessed using the sucrose preference and forced swim tests. Sucrose preference was assessed by providing mice with access to two water bottles overnight on a daily basis throughout the experiment. One bottle contained drinking water and the other bottle contained 1.5% (w/v) sucrose in drinking water. The percentage of sucrose solution over the total liquid consumed was calculated. The amount of plain water and sucrose solution consumed was weighed daily. Prior to the start of paclitaxel, mice were trained to achieve 80% or higher of daily sucrose consumption. Behavioral testing for memory, where mice were removed from their home cage, interfered with liquid consumption and sucrose preference testing, making the data unreliable. As such we excluded sucrose preference data during the days of behavioral testing for memory and locomotor activity that required removal from the home cage.The forced swim test was conducted 1 h after the completion of the novel object/place recognition test. Mice were placed individually in a plastic bucket (20 cm diameter) filled to a depth of 15 cm with water (24 ± 1°C) for 6 min. After the testing period, mice were removed and dried with paper towel before being returned to their home cage. The test was performed in complete darkness and recorded under infrared light. The total swimming distance was tracked and measured using Viewer III (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany) software. Immobility time was scored manually by an observer blinded to treatment condition.Gene Expression AnalysesTotal RNA was isolated from frozen tongue, whole brain, and liver tissue using NucleoSpin® Plus (Nucleospin, Germany). Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify gene expression in 100 ng of total RNA using Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, USA) targeting mouse genes of interest: Tas1r1 Mm00473433_m1, Tas1r2 Mm00499716_m1, Tas1r3 Mm00473459_g1, Il-1b Mm01336189_m1, Tnfa Mm00443258_m1, Il-6 Mm00446190_m1, Ifng Mm01168134_m1, Ido1 Mm00492590_m1, Actb Mm00607939_s1), and an iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Biorad, USA), with 40 PCR amplification cycles of 15 s of strand separation at 95°C, and 30 s of annealing and extension at 60°C. Relative quantitative measurement of target gene levels was performed using the ΔΔCt method, where Ct is the threshold concentration. Actb was used as the endogenous housekeeping control gene for livers, brain and tongue.Quantification of Tongue PapillaeFresh tongue tissue was harvested from mice immediately after CO2 euthanasia. The dorsal surface of the tongue was immediately stained with India ink to enhance visualization of tongue papillae. Images of tongue tissues were captured using a dissecting microscope with camera attachment. A defined and consistent virtual circular region was drawn around the anterior part of the tongue in each image and the number of papillae within the region was scored by an observer blinded to treatment condition.Plasma and Brain Cytokine Protein AnalysisBlood samples were centrifuged at 5000 g for 10min at 4°C. Plasma was isolated and stored at -80°C until assayed. Plasma samples were analyzed undiluted. Frozen whole brains were first pulverized using sterilized steel tissue crushers, which were placed in liquid nitrogen prior to use to ensure tissue temperature did not rise. The powder was thoroughly mixed to ensure equal representation of brain regions throughout the powder. Protein was then extracted from 20 mg of the frozen brain tissue sample by sonicating samples in 200 µl extraction solvent (PBS containing 1xPhosSTOP, Roche). Samples were centrifuged at 15,500 g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatant was collected. Protein content was measured using Bradford assays and standardized to 2 mg/ml A panel of 23 cytokines was measured, using a Bioplex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Gladesville, Australia), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The plate was read using a Bio-Rad BioPlex200 machine. Median fluorescence data was collected by the instrument and the Bio-Plex Manager software calculated cytokine concentrations as pg/ml based on the standard curve per cytokine using a 5-parameter logistic (5-PL) method.Plasma and Brain Paclitaxel Concentration AnalysisPaclitaxel concentration in the brain and plasma of mice (n = 4) was determined by LC-MS using a Waters Micromass Quattro Premier coupled to a Waters Acuity UPLC. Gradient chromatography was achieved with an acetonitrile-water/0.05% formic acid mobile phase and a Supelco Ascentic Express RP C18 (50 x 2.1 mm, 2.7 µm) column. Each whole brain was homogenized in aqueous buffer (3-fold mass/volume ratio), and the resulting homogenates were then protein-precipitated with acetonitrile (3-fold volume/volume ratio). Plasma samples were protein-precipitated with acetonitrile (2-fold volume/volume ratio). Quantitation was performed relative to spiked calibration standards prepared in blank mouse plasma (paclitaxel range: 1–10,000 ng/ml) and brain homogenate (paclitaxel range: 5-10,000 ng/g tissue).Statistical AnalysisOne-way or two-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) (paclitaxel vs vehicle) (aspirin vs placebo) were used to analyze longitudinal data assessing memory, depression-like behavior, and sickness responses and behavior. Single time-point data (cytokines, tongue papillae, and taste receptors) were assessed using unpaired t-tests. Planned comparisons were performed to assess change from the control group, and were determined using Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons tests adjusted for the number of comparisons to control for family-wise error. Association between plasma cytokines at day 26 and memory performance on the novel object/place recognition test at day 22 of the experiment was examined using the Pearson correlation test. Outliers were considered if they were 2 or more standard deviations from the mean. Experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate.

The novel object/novel place recognition test assesses memory by capitalizing on the innate preference of mice to explore novelty. It requires mice to remember an object they saw, and its position, in a previous period of exploration. Paclitaxel caused immediate and sustained impairment (within 24 h of stopping treatment, i.e. on day 13 of the experiment) on the novel object/novel place recognition test, indicated by reduced time spent exploring the novel object compared to vehicle-treated controls. Cognitive impairment was sustained 10 days after cessation of chemotherapy (day 22 of the experiment; F
(1,24) = 15.48, p = 0.01) (Figure 1B). The Y-Maze spontaneous alternation test assesses spatial reference memory and working memory (24). No difference in working and spatial reference memory was observed at either time point based on performance on the Y-Maze spontaneous alternation test (p > 0.05) (Figure 1C).Figure 1Paclitaxel induces memory impairment and anhedonia. (A) Experimental design to evaluate the immediate and late effects of paclitaxel on memory and depression-like behavior for mice treated with paclitaxel vs. vehicle. Mice were treated every second day with 10 mg/kg paclitaxel vs. vehicle for 14 days and memory was assessed at 24–48 h and 10–11 days after the final dose of paclitaxel (days 13–14 and 22–23 of the experiment). (B–C) Memory assessed in the test phase of the novel object/novel place recognition test or in the Y-Maze alternation test. (D) Depression-like behavior was assessed by sucrose preference throughout and after treatment with paclitaxel. (E) Immobility was assessed in the forced swim test at 24 h and 10 days after paclitaxel treatment (days 13 and 22 of the experiment). Data are presented as mean + SE; n = 6–16/group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 from repeated two-way ANOVA (B—main effect of paclitaxel) or repeated one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test (D).Depression-like behavior was assessed using the sucrose preference and forced swim tests. Both tests are sensitive and well-validated methods, where depression-like behavior in rodents is indicated by reduced consumption of sucrose solution or increased immobility during the forced swim test (25, 26). Paclitaxel reduced sucrose preference, which reached significance based on multiple comparisons on days 17-19 (F
(19,540) = 3.17, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1D) but did not change forced swim test immobility (Figure 1E) (p > 0.05). Reduced sucrose preference could indicate depression-like behavior, or may be attributable to chemotherapy-induced changes in taste perception, which would not impact behavior in the forced swim test. To investigate this, we quantified the effect of chemotherapy treatment on taste bud density and taste receptor expression. Patients report a loss of taste perception after chemotherapy (27, 28), which has been attributed to loss of taste buds and the receptors that signal flavor perception (29, 30). Perception of sweet flavors are determined by receptors encoded by Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 genes, whereas umami flavors involve Tas1r1 and Tas1r3 genes. Paclitaxel had no effect on the quantity of tongue papillae (Figure 2A), but reduced expression of Tas1r1 mRNA [t
(12) = 5.12, p < 0.01] without affecting either Tas1r2 or Tas1r3 gene expression, indicating a possible impairment in umami flavor perception but not for perception of sweet flavors such as sucrose solution (Figure 2B). Considered together, these data suggest that the observed reduction in sucrose preference reflects paclitaxel-induced anhedonia and not an inability to recognize the sweet sucrose solution.Figure 2Paclitaxel does not impair sweetened taste perception.

Data are presented as mean + SE; n = 7–8/group. **p < 0.001 from two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.Paclitaxel-Induced Memory Impairment and Anhedonia Are Independent of Paclitaxel-Induced SicknessCancer patients receiving chemotherapy typically report symptoms of sickness such as nausea, weight loss, and fatigue that are attributed to both the cancer and to chemotherapy treatment (31, 32). To investigate if paclitaxel-induced memory impairment and anhedonia (Figures 1B, D) were due to treatment-induced inactivity and/or sickness, we assessed the effect of paclitaxel on body weight, liquid consumption, and burrowing activity. Paclitaxel did not affect body weight (Figure 3A) or burrowing activity (Figure 3B), and did not alter distance travelled in either the learning or testing phase in the novel object/novel place recognition (Figures 3C, D) or in the locomotor activity test (Figure 3E). These findings indicate that poor performance on the behavioral tasks was not due to inactivity or loss of motivation. Furthermore, no difference in liquid consumption was observed between paclitaxel and vehicle-treated mice in sucrose preference test (Figure 3F) (p > 0.05). Together, these data suggest that the observed memory impairment and anhedonia (Figures 1B, D) are unlikely due to paclitaxel-induced sickness behaviors.Figure 3Paclitaxel does not induce sickness or inactivity.

Data are presented as mean + SE; n = 6–16 mice/group.Paclitaxel Induces Delayed Peripheral InflammationClinical studies have reported elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients and survivors treated with chemotherapy (32–34). We first determined whether our model of paclitaxel-induced memory impairment recapitulated cytokine changes found in those clinical studies by quantifying cytokine gene expression and protein levels 24 h and 2 weeks after stopping chemotherapy treatment. Hepatic cytokines were assayed as a source of peripheral inflammatory cytokines and did not change 24 h after the last dose of paclitaxel as measured by qRT-PCR (p > 0.05) (Figure 4A). Plasma protein levels confirmed no evidence of inflammation in paclitaxel-treated mice at this time-point, although IFNγ and CCL5 were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). However, paclitaxel significantly elevated expression of hepatic Il1b, Tnfa and Ifng 2 weeks after treatment (all p < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Inflammation at 2 weeks after cessation of paclitaxel treatment was confirmed with increases in IL17, IFNγ, GMCSF, CXCL1, and CCL5 plasma protein (all p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Correlation analyses confirmed that peripheral cytokines were not associated with memory performance (Supplementary Table 1). These findings show that immediate deficits in memory and mood (within 24 h of stopping paclitaxel) were independent of peripheral inflammation. In contrast, sustained memory impairment and anhedonia (2 weeks after treatment cessation) was accompanied by peripheral inflammation.Figure 4Paclitaxel induces delayed peripheral inflammation.

The dotted line at 1 represents vehicle-treated control levels. Data are presented as mean + SE; n = 4–12/group. *p < 0.05 from two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.Paclitaxel Does Not Induce NeuroinflammationDespite seeing no evidence of peripheral inflammation at 24 h after paclitaxel treatment, it was possible that paclitaxel may be entering the brain and inducing compartmentalized neuroinflammation at this earlier time. While significantly lower in concentration than in the plasma, we still confirmed that paclitaxel crossed the blood brain barrier and was present in the brain parenchyma (Figure 5A). We then assessed brain cytokine levels at 24 h and 2 weeks after stopping chemotherapy. Paclitaxel did not increase cytokine or chemokine concentrations at 24 h, but rather decreased several cytokines and chemokines compared to vehicle controls (Figure 5B). Paclitaxel treatment had no effect on cytokine gene expression at 2 weeks (p > 0.05) (Figure 5C), which was confirmed by protein analysis of a wider array of cytokines and chemokines (Figure 5D). These data indicate that the paclitaxel-induced peripheral inflammatory signature may not be reflected in the brain, and that there is no association between neuroinflammation and paclitaxel-induced memory impairment.Figure 5Paclitaxel does not induce brain inflammation.

N.D. = not detectable.Inflammation Is Not Causal in Paclitaxel-Induced Cognitive ImpairmentTo experimentally confirm that inflammation does not play a role in paclitaxel-induced memory impairment, we treated mice orally with the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin in drinking water at a dose we previously showed to be effective in preventing tumor-induced memory impairment using the novel object/novel place recognition test (11). Mice commenced oral aspirin 24 h prior to the first injection of paclitaxel and were maintained on aspirin until the end of the experiment. To avoid confounds caused by aspirin delivered in drinking water, we did not conduct sucrose preference testing in these mice. Consistent with our previous findings, paclitaxel induced impairment on the novel object/novel place recognition test 24 h after cessation of paclitaxel (day 13 of the experiment), and this was sustained 10 days later (day 23 of the experiment) [F
(1,52) = 9.07, p < 0.01]. Aspirin did not affect memory performance on this task at any time point (Figure 6). These findings support the contention that inflammation is not responsible for either the immediate or sustained effects of paclitaxel on memory or affective behavior in this model.Figure 6Aspirin does not improve paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. Memory was assessed at 24 h and 10 days after the final dose of paclitaxel or vehicle (days 13 and 23 of the experiment) in the test phase of the novel object/novel place recognition test in aspirin vs. placebo treated mice (n > 11/group). Data are presented as mean + SE; n = 11–16/group. **p < 0.01 from repeated two-way ANOVA (main effect of paclitaxel).DiscussionThe role of inflammation in chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and affective symptoms is controversial. While multiple clinical studies have reported associations between peripheral inflammatory markers and reduced mood and cognitive impairment in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, this correlation could plausibly be explained by effects of the chemotherapy or the cancer itself (11). By using animal models, the current study eliminated the potential confound of cancer-induced inflammation on memory and mood-related behaviors and revealed the role of paclitaxel chemotherapy on behavior and inflammation in the body and the brain. In doing so, this study replicated clinical studies that demonstrate peripheral inflammatory markers occur alongside mood and cognition changes in patients that receive chemotherapy (32–34), suggesting that paclitaxel alone may contribute to the increase of these inflammatory markers. However, the findings of this study support the contention that pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with, but not responsible for, chemobrain.Not all cognitive and depression-like domains were impaired by paclitaxel. The novel object/novel place recognition test involves aspects of both episodic and spatial memory, whereas the spontaneous Y-Maze alternation test measures working and spatial memory. Paclitaxel-induced impairment in the novel object/novel place test suggests that hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is vulnerable to paclitaxel whereas heavily-utilized working memory and spatial memory may be more resilient to the impact of paclitaxel. This contention is supported by studies showing that the hippocampus is sensitive to impairment in neurogenesis by paclitaxel (35, 36). Similarly, while paclitaxel induced anhedonia, it did not cause other depression-like phenotypes such as learned helplessness in the forced swim test, suggesting certain domains of depression may be more susceptible to the impact of chemotherapy than others. Future studies should explore the possibility that the changes in sucrose preference reflect anhedonia specifically and not paclitaxel-induced changes to the interoceptive state of the mice, which are partially refuted by the examination of tongue papillae and taste receptor gene expression in this study. These findings confirm clinical studies that report differential effects of chemotherapy on numerous cognitive processes and across time (37, 38). Future evaluation of specific brain regions, as well as affective and cognitive processes, are required to better understand the impact of chemotherapy on cognition.Clinical studies have reported elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood of patients and survivors treated with chemotherapy (32–34). This has led to the assumption that neuroinflammation is induced by chemotherapy-induced peripheral inflammation, which propagates inflammation to the brain. Consistent with clinical findings, paclitaxel caused immediate and long-lasting impairment in memory and anhedonia in mice, but peripheral inflammation only became apparent 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment. Regardless, peripheral cytokines measured 2 weeks after paclitaxel did not propagate inflammation to the brain (Figure 5D), which disputes the assumption made in patients that chemotherapy-induced inflammation in the body is always reflected in the brain. There was also no evidence of inflammation in the brain at 24 h after paclitaxel treatment despite evidence of memory impairment and anhedonia, and paclitaxel having crossed the blood-brain barrier. These findings are discordant with the contention that transit of paclitaxel into the brain induces compartmentalized neuroinflammation, leading to memory loss and affective symptoms in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy.The absence of inflammation after chemotherapy reported here is supported by other preclinical studies (39, 40). Nonetheless, some studies have shown that chemotherapy increases inflammatory cytokines in blood and brain tissue (18, 19, 41–43). As each of these animal studies used different chemotherapeutic agents, doses, or treatment regimens, it is possible the role of inflammation on chemobrain may be specific to chemotherapy type or magnitude of exposure.The fact that increases in cytokines were not observed in plasma until 2 weeks after paclitaxel treatment despite immediate effects on memory and anhedonia is supported by clinical data. In breast cancer patients no significant changes in plasma inflammatory cytokines were observed until 3 weeks after cessation of the entire chemotherapy regimen, despite impairment in perceived cognitive function being reported during chemotherapy treatment (8). Together these findings suggest a temporal dissociation between chemotherapy-induced cytokine production and symptoms of chemobrain, and supports the contention that alternative mechanisms are responsible for the induction of at least some symptoms of chemobrain.While the results do not support a role for cytokines in chemobrain, it is possible that other inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins contribute to chemobrain. Paclitaxel has been shown to affect macrophages to induce the expression of cyclooxygenase-2—the enzyme that converts arachidonic acids to prostaglandins (44)—and increase the production of prostaglandin E2 (45). As prostaglandins have been implicated in the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases (46), it is possible that paclitaxel may similarly increase production of prostaglandins in mice, contributing to memory impairment. However, administration of aspirin, a non-selective anti-inflammatory drug that blocks cyclooxygenase-2, had no effect on paclitaxel-induced memory impairment in the current study, supporting the contention that inflammation may not contribute to paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. These findings also indicate that while aspirin may have therapeutic utility for the prevention of tumor-induced cognitive impairment (11), aspirin is unlikely to show benefit in targeting paclitaxel-induced chemobrain. It will be important to determine the potential use of aspirin to target chemobrain symptoms induced by other chemotherapeutic agents and dosing schedules that have been shown to increase inflammatory cytokines (19, 41–43).Study limitations may have influenced the capacity to observe noticeable changes in cytokine levels in paclitaxel-treated mice. Firstly, we assessed cytokines in whole brains, which may mask the effects of chemotherapy on cytokines in specific brain regions (41). Secondly, it is possible that the method of euthanasia influenced cytokine levels, which has been previously reported (47). However, all mice were euthanized using the same method.The current findings offer important insights into correlative evidence that cognitive impairment and mood-related symptoms are associated with elevated inflammatory markers in clinical (6, 34) and preclinical studies of cancer treatment (19, 48). This study confirms recent findings that paclitaxel is able to cross the blood brain barrier in the absence of cancer (35), raising the possibility of direct cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel on cells of the brain. Recent studies support this assertion with evidence that chemotherapy drugs induce apoptosis in neurons, reduce neurogenesis and synaptic integrity, and cause mitochondrial dysfunction (19, 40, 42, 48, 49). Additionally, the downregulation of vesicular zinc in the hippocampus has also been shown to mediate the effect of paclitaxel on hippocampal neurogenesis (36). Moreover, the presence of cancer could enhance “leakiness” of the blood-brain barrier (50), thereby potentiating the penetration of paclitaxel to the brain and the magnitude of neurotoxicity. However, as chemotherapy could reduce cancer burden, chemotherapy may equally reduce the effect of cancer-induced cognitive impairment (11). Emerging studies examining the effects of both chemotherapy and cancer on cognitive impairment will be able to provide more insights into the complex interaction between chemotherapy, cancer and the brain (40).ConclusionOur findings question the role of inflammation in paclitaxel-induced chemobrain. The findings show aspirin is unlikely to be effective in preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, in contrast to recent findings that aspirin may be effectively repurposed to combat cancer-induced cognitive impairment (11). This distinction is critical to inform clinical trial design for evaluation of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat cognitive impairment, before, during, and after cancer treatment.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe animal study was reviewed and approved by Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee.Author ContributionsAC contributed to conception, design, data acquisition, analysis, interpretation, and manuscript preparation.

Out of the 46 eligible patients from the Karolinska PANS cohort, 34 consented to participate in a follow-up (median 3.3 years). Participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation and were classified according to their clinical course. Resulting groups were compared on clinical characteristics and laboratory test results. We observed significant reductions in clinician-rated PANS symptom severity and improved general function. Two patients were classified as remitted, 20 as relapsing–remitting, and 12 as having a chronic-static/progressive course. The latter group had an earlier onset, greater impairment and received more pharmacological and psychological treatments. Although remission was rare, the majority of children with PANS were significantly improved over the follow-up period but a non-negligible minority of patients displayed a chronic-static/progressive course and required additional treatments. The proposed definitions of flare and clinical course may be useful in future clinical trials.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s10578-021-01135-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.KeywordsPANSPANDASOCDTouretteImmunopsychiatryhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004348Stockholms Läns Landstinghttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013491Jane och Dan Olssons StiftelseFRF-stiftelsenFonden för psykisk hälsaKarolinska InstituteOpen Access funding provided by Karolinska Instituteissue-copyright-statement© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022IntroductionPediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) describes the acute onset or worsening of obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms and/or anorexia in temporal relation with other severe neuropsychiatric and somatic symptoms. Secondary signs include anxiety, emotional lability, irritability/aggression, regression, deterioration in school performance, sensory and motor abnormalities and somatic signs such as enuresis, sleep disturbance and pain [1]. The diagnosis of PANS requires an acute onset, but subsequent clinical courses may range from fully remitting after a single episode, to a waxing and waning course with intense exacerbations or flares, or even more chronic or progressive courses. Exacerbations or flares have been described in PANS since the initial definition of the syndrome, without being part of the diagnostic criteria [1]. In the acute phase, the symptoms are often severe and may lead to significant loss of function [2]. Psychiatric comorbidities are common and may need to be treated in parallel to the PANS-related symptoms [3, 4]. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) constitutes a sub-group of patients within the broader PANS construct, which requires the verified presence of a streptococcal infection temporally associated with the onset of symptoms [5].While the psychiatric and somatic status of patients with PANS/PANDAS has been reasonably well described in cross-sectional studies, including high rates of pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorders and a strong association with autoimmune disease in both patients and first degree relatives, there is a shortage of long-term follow-up data of PANS/PANDAS cohorts [2, 3]. The available longitudinal data primarily originates from a handful of case reports and chart reviews, methods that not well suited for assessing the fraction of participants who may be remitting [6]. In a notable exception, Leon et al. described longitudinal outcomes for 33 patients with PANDAS who were followed up by telephone after participation in a randomized trial of intra-venous immunoglobulins (IVIG) compared to placebo, 0.5 to 4.8 years after trial completion [7]. At baseline, participants were required to meet the criteria for clinically significant obsessive–compulsive symptoms, in addition to at least three other comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms. During the follow-up period, a majority (72%) of the patients had experienced at least one exacerbation of PANDAS symptoms, defined as a noticeable increase in a child’s previous PANDAS symptoms for a period of at least 24 h. A small fraction (12%) experienced clinically significant OCD-symptoms at follow-up, suggesting that the long-term prognosis of children with PANDAS was generally positive. However, a small proportion of cases (9%) had a more chronic course. A third of the children (33%) had received at least one new psychiatric diagnosis during the follow-up period, the most common being attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (18%). No face-to-face psychiatric or somatic evaluations or laboratory tests were conducted. To our knowledge, there are no published systematic follow-up data on patients with PANS, and thus their prognosis in the medium-to-long-term timeframe is currently unknown.Given the paucity of available follow-up data on this patient group, we aimed to conduct a naturalistic follow-up of the patients included in a well-characterized Swedish cohort [3]. To minimize the risk of selectively following-up chronic patients in need of medical attention, we aimed to re-contact families regardless of whether they were still active in our clinic or not. Specifically, we conducted an assessment of current psychiatric and somatic health status, including laboratory tests, at the time of follow-up and investigated clinical characteristics that may influence disease course and prognosis in our cohort. An additional aim was to propose operational definitions of symptom flare and of various clinical courses of the syndrome that could be helpful in future research and clinical settings.MethodsClinical SettingAll study participants were recruited from a specialist OCD and related disorders outpatient clinic in Stockholm, Sweden, and had previously been included in the PANS cohort at Karolinska Institutet [3]. The clinic primarily receives referrals from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Services (CAMHS) and pediatric services in the Stockholm region, but also from other parts of Sweden and the Nordic countries. The clinic has accepted PANS referrals since 2014.All patients in the PANS cohort with a minimum of 2 years since inclusion were eligible for participation in the follow-up, regardless of whether they were still active patients in the clinic or not. Patients and parents/legal guardians gave written consent to participate in the initial cohort as well as the follow-up study, both approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm [reference number EPN 2015/1977-31/4 (2019-02132)].Clinical EvaluationsThe evaluation at follow-up was a 2-h face-to-face assessment conducted by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. The assessment included a standardized patient- and parent interview focusing on current psychiatric and somatic health status, clinical change since the first visit, number of flares, potential triggers and course of disease, culture-verified and non-verified infections, previous and current medication, psychological treatments and family history of psychiatric and autoimmune or inflammatory disease. The information provided by the families was also verified against the patients’ electronic medical records. Questions about pre-school/school attendance referred to a time period of 3 months prior to the follow-up assessment. A medical examination for documentation of somatic signs was made, including height, weight, skin, heart, lungs, stomach, thyroid, lymph nodes, ears, throat, joints, neurology and motor function.The following clinician-rated measures of symptoms and general function were employed:The Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) is a widely used single-item measure of general functioning (ranging from 1 to 100), regardless of treatment and/or prognosis [8, 9]. The measurement should reflect the most impaired level of a specified time period of 1 month. Its psychometric properties have been extensively validated [10].The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated scale measuring the severity of a patient’s psychiatric illness on an 8 point single scale, ranging from ‘normal’ (score 1) to ‘extremely ill’ (score 7) [11]. The Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), was used to assess the degree of clinical improvement at follow-up, relative to baseline, with scores ranging from ‘very much improved’ (score 1) to ‘very much worse’ (score 7) [11]. Both CGI-S and CGI-I have been validated and are widely used clinical outcome measures in psychiatry [12].The Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) are the gold standard instruments to quantify the severity of OCD and tic disorder symptoms, respectively [13–15]. They are routinely employed in both clinical practice and clinical trials and have excellent psychometric properties [14, 16, 17].Baseline data on age at symptom onset, comorbidity at onset, Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S) scores were extracted from the baseline clinical assessment, published in the original description of the cohort [3].Operational Definitions of Flare and Clinical CourseBased on our clinical experience with the patient group, we developed the following a priori operational definition of symptom flare:We defined flare as worsening of PANS-related symptoms and/or loss of function (CGI-S equal to or > 4) for longer than 4 days, irrespective of treatment given. The time period of 4 days was chosen because, according to our clinical experience, medical treatments given to treat flares frequently give effect by this time.Our definitions of clinical course were as follows:Remitting course: Patients who experienced no PANS symptoms for the last 12 months.Relapsing–remitting course: Patients who experienced at least one flare during the last 12 months, but who had been in remission > 50% of the time for the last 12 months.Chronic-static/progressive course: Patients fulfilling criteria for flare > 50% of the time for the last 12 months.Laboratory AnalysesThe laboratory protocol was the same one developed by the team for regular clinical use [3]. It includes basic blood measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), hemoglobin, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid tests, indicators for liver and kidney disease, vitamin D levels, ferritin, celiac test and inflammatory and rheumatological markers such as protein fractions, immunoglobulin G, A and M, IgG subclasses, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), serum amyloid A (SAA) and interleukin (IL)-1-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. A throat culture was taken at the same time. The reference values used were those used clinically by the Karolinska laboratory [18].Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was conducted using STATA software (version STATA/IC15.1 for Mac, StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA). Analyses were largely descriptive in nature. When comparing the various clinical course sub-groups of patients within the cohort, t-tests were employed for continuous variables with parametric distributions and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for non-parametric distributions. Chi-square tests were employed for proportions. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsDemographic and Clinical CharacteristicsOut of the 46 patients eligible for follow-up, 34 consented to participate (Fig. 1). The main reasons for attrition were that the families no longer wished to participate in research or that they canceled their participation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between those who were available or unavailable at follow-up (Table S1). Median age at disease onset was 6.6 years (range 3–11.5), median age at follow-up was 11.5 years (range 6.7–17.1) and 19 (56%) of the participants were male. Median time since symptom onset was 4.8 years (range 3–9.2) and the median follow-up time was 3.3 years (range 2.3–4.9).Fig. 1Flow chart of participant inclusion, and groupings based on clinical courseThe number of flares over the last 12 months prior to the follow-up assessment ranged from 0 to 3 (median = 1). Twenty participants (59%) reported no verified infections (positive culture or positive clinical assessment) during the 12 months prior to follow-up, ten (29%) reported one, three (9%) reported two and only one (3%) reported four. The number of reported unverified infections (parent-reported) during the same period was much higher, ranging from 0 to 8 (median = 2.5).Only two participants (6%) had a previous neuropsychiatric diagnosis (ASD) at baseline. During the follow-up time, another 13 (38%) received a neuropsychiatric diagnosis (nine (26%) ADHD, three (9%) ASD and one (3%) intellectual disability). Eleven participants (32%) had a comorbid condition commonly considered to have an autoimmune or inflammatory etiology, of which four (12%) were newly diagnosed during the follow-up period. These conditions included severe asthma, severe atopic eczema, severe and multiple nutritional allergies, celiac disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, postinfectious arthritis, and Henoch-Schönlein’s purpura. Twenty-eight participants (82%) had a family history of inflammatory or autoimmune disease and 27 (79%) had a family history of psychiatric disorder. During the 3 months prior to the follow-up interview, six participants (18%) had missed more than one school day per week on average. For a full summary of the sample’s socio-demographic data, see Table S2.For the 34 patients included in the follow-up, the median CGAS score had increased from 53 (range 54–70) at baseline to 61 (range 28–80) at follow-up, a statistically significant difference (z = − 3.59, p < 0.001). The wide range of scores is suggestive of substantial heterogeneity within the cohort.Similarly, the CGI-S scores had decreased from a median moderate level of severity 4 (range 2–6) to a mild level 3 (range 1–6), a statistically significant difference (z = 3.70, p < 0.001). The median CGI-I score was 1 (range 1–4), and 29 participants (85%) were rated as being ‘much improved’ or ‘very much improved’, indicating substantial improvements relative to baseline at the group level (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Distribution of clinician-rated CGASa and CGI-Sb scores at baseline and follow-up, and of CGI-Ic scores at follow-up. aCGAS: Children’s Global Assessment Scale. bCGI-S: Clinical Global Impression—Severity scale. cCGI-I: Clinical Global Impression—Improvement scalePsychiatric Symptoms and Somatic Signs at Follow-UpThe most common reported symptoms at follow-up were obsessive–compulsive symptoms (62%) and tics (50%). About a third of the patients reported anxiety (35%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (35%), behavioral difficulties (32%), depressive symptoms (29%), sleep disorder (29%) and tiredness/fatigue (29%).The median CY-BOCS score at follow-up was 8 (range 0–30). Only five participants (15%) had a CY-BOCS score above 15, corresponding to the minimum entry severity criterion in clinical trials of OCD. Though half of the participants reported tics at follow-up, the YGTSS scores were low (median 4.5, range 0–65). Only two (6%) scored above 30, indicating that clinically relevant tic disorder was uncommon at follow-up. Approximately a third of the participants (36%) had some kind of abnormality in the somatic assessment (skin abrasions and eczema being the most common ones), but only a minority of these findings was clinically meaningful or actionable (Table 1).Table 1Psychiatric symptoms and somatic signs at follow-up (n = 34)n%Obsessive–compulsive symptoms2162CY-BOCS score > 15515Tics1750YGTSS scores > 3026Hyperactivity/impulsivity1235Anxiety symptoms1235Behavioral difficulties1132Depressive symptoms1029Sleeping difficulties1029Tiredness/fatigue1029Pain824Cognitive difficulties618Eating disorder symptoms515Urinary problems26Perceived changes in personality13Abnormalities in somatic assessment12 (n total = 33)36Skin abrasions, eczema, psoriasis9 (n total = 33)27Choreatic movements2 (n total = 33)6Otitis2 (n total = 33)6Tonsillitis1 (n total 33)3CY-BOCS Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, YGTSS Yale Global Tic Severity ScaleTreatments Received During the Follow-UpEighty-five percent of the participants had received some kind of medication over the last 12 months prior to the follow-up assessment. Melatonin was the most common prescription (47%), followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (44%), antibiotics (41%), guanfacine (24%) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (21%). Only one participant (3%) had been prescribed antipsychotics. None of the antibiotics prescribed from our clinic were long-term or prophylactic prescriptions, but one participant was on long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, which had been initiated at another clinic. The rest of the antibiotic prescriptions were all short-term courses of treatment prescribed in association with a verified or highly suspected infection. Immunomodulatory drugs such as cortisone and IVIG were less common (12% each).A majority (59%) of the participants had received some kind of psychological treatment or parental intervention in the 12 months prior to the follow-up assessment. Thirty-eight percent had received CBT and 44% other interventions, such as parental strategies, parental groups and counseling (Table 2).Table 2Pharmacological and psychological interventions received during the 12 months prior to the follow-up appointment (n = 34)n%Any medication2985Melatonin1647NSAIDs1544Antibiotics1441Guanfacine824SSRI721Cortisone412IVIG412Stimulants39Neuroleptics13Any psychological treatments/interventions2059Other interventions (parental strategies, groups, counselling)1544CBT1338NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, SSRI selective serotonine re-uptake inhibitor, IVIG intra-venous immunoglobulins, CBT cognitive behavioral therapyLaboratory FindingsTwenty-seven of the 34 participants gave samples for laboratory tests taken at the time of follow-up. The missing laboratory tests were due to the COVID-19 restrictions in Sweden at the time of the study, preventing some of the participants to access the Karolinska laboratory facilities. Complete blood count (CBC) abnormalities and protein fractions abnormalities were common (78% and 74%, respectively). Six participants (22%) had complement abnormalities. Almost a fifth (19%) had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), 15% had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) abnormalities and 11% had low thyroxine (T4). Two participants (7%) had positive ANAs. Only one (4%) had low IgG, but 41% had IgG sub-class deficiencies. Thirty-six per-cent had elevated IL-1-β, 20% elevated IL-10 and 19% elevated TNF-α. None of the other measured cytokines were elevated. Twelve percent of the sample had a positive streptococci throat culture (Table 3). With the exception of the positive streptococci cultures, which required management with antibiotics, the remainder of the laboratory findings did not require specific medical treatments. Thyroid abnormalities initiated further laboratory screening, but were not sufficiently severe to require immediate medical intervention.Table 3Laboratory tests taken at follow-up (n = 27)n%Protein fractions abnormalities (incl CRP)2074CBC abnormalities18 (n total = 26)69IgG sub-class deficiencies1141Elevated IL-1-β9 (n total = 25)36Complement abnormalities622Low vitamin D622Low IgA622Elevated IL-105 (n total = 25)20Elevated TNF-α5 (n total = 26)19Elevated anti-TPO519TSH abnormalities415Positive throat culture3 (n total = 25)12Low T4311Elevated IgM311Positive ANA27Elevated ESR1 (n total = 26)4Elevated CRP14Elevated SAA14Low IgG14Elevated transglutaminase antibodies00Elevated IL-60 (n total = 26)0Elevated IL-80 (n total = 26)0CBC complete blood count, IgG immunoglobulin G, IL-1-β interleukin 1 β, IgA immunoglobulin A, IL-10 interleukin 10, TNF-α tumor necrosis factor α, Anti-TPO thyroid peroxidase antibodies, TSH thyroid stimulating hormone, T4 thyroxine, IgM immunoglobulin M, ANA antinuclear antibodies, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP C-reactive protein, SAA serum amyloid A, IL-6 interleukin 6, IL-8 interleukin 8Groupings Based on Clinical CourseUsing the a priori operational definitions of flare and disease course, and based on all available information at the time of follow-up assessment, two participants (6%) were classified as having remitted, 20 (59%) as relapsing–remitting, and 12 (35%) as having a chronic-static/progressive course. Due to the insufficient number of participants in full remission, we recoded the groups into a non-chronic group (remitting + relapsing–remitting groups) and a chronic group (chronic-static/progressive group). Twenty-two participants (65%) were thus classified as being non-chronic and 12 (35%) as being chronic.There was no gender difference between the non-chronic and chronic groups (χ2 = 0.5, p = 0.62). Interestingly, age at baseline and follow-up were both significantly lower in the chronic compared to the non-chronic group (z = 2.36, p = 0.02 and z = 2.04, p = 0.04, respectively), while the follow-up time was similar between the two groups (z = − 0.25, p = 0.8). There was a tendency towards a higher autoimmune or inflammatory comorbidity in the chronic group (50%) compared to the non-chronic group (23%), but this difference was not significant (χ2 = 2.64, p = 0.1). The same was true for having received a neuropsychiatric diagnosis during the follow-up time (seven participants (58%) compared to six (27%), χ2 = 3.17, p = 0.08). The median number of flares in the year prior to the follow-up interview was 0.5 (range 0–3) in the non-chronic group and 1 (range 0–3) in the chronic group, but the difference was not statistically significant (z = 1.22, p = 0.22). There were no between-group differences regarding family history of psychiatric or autoimmune and inflammatory disease (χ2 = 0.62, p = 0.64 and χ2 = 0.01, p = 0.91, respectively) (Table S2).At baseline, the non-chronic and chronic groups had similar symptom severity (CGI-S scores), but the chronic course group had a significantly higher impairment (lower CGAS scores) (z = 2.08, p = 0.04). At follow-up, participants in the chronic course group remained significantly more impaired on the CGAS (z = 3.54, p < 0.001) and had significantly higher CGI-S scores (z = − 3.88, p < 0.001). As expected, the chronic course group had improved significantly less on the CGI-I than the non-chronic group (z = − 2.08, p = 0.04). School attendance was also lower in the chronic course group, with five out of 12 (42%) missing more than one school day per week on average, compared to only one out of 22 (5%) in the non-chronic course group (χ2 = 7.36, p = 0.01) (Table S2).At follow-up, the two groups did not significantly differ in the severity of obsessive–compulsive or tic symptoms (CY-BOCS and YGTSS scores, respectively). However, the chronic course group had higher rates of hyperactivity/impulsivity (χ2 = 12,8, p < 0.001), anxiety (χ2 = 7.99, p = 0.01), behavioral difficulties (χ2 = 5.72, p = 0.02), depressive symptoms (χ2 = 7.47, p = 0.01), sleep disorder (χ2 = 12.4, p < 0.001), eating disorder (χ2 = 5.13, p = 0.02) and urinary problems (χ2 = 3.9, p = 0.05) than did the non-chronic course group. Abnormalities in the somatic assessment were more frequent in the chronic course group, but this difference was not statistically significant (χ2 = 1.52, p = 0.22) (Table S3).All of the participants in the chronic course group had received medical treatment during the last 12 months. In this group, nine participants (75%) had received NSAIDs, nine (75%) melatonin, eight (67%) antibiotics and seven (58%) guanfacine. Four participants (33%) had received IVIG and three (25%) cortisone. About two thirds (77%) of participants in the non-chronic course group had received medication during the preceding 12 months, but this difference was not statistically significant. Compared to the non-chronic group, the prescription rates in the chronic group were significantly higher for IVIG (χ2 = 8.31, p < 0.001), NSAIDs (χ2 = 7.17, p = 0.01), antibiotics (χ2 = 4.97, p = 0.03), guanfacine (χ2 = 12.49, p < 0.001) and melatonin (χ2 = 5.81, p = 0.02). Similarly to medical treatments, the frequency of psychological/parental interventions was significantly higher in the chronic compared to the non-chronic course group (χ2 = 4.60, p = 0.03) (Table S4).Levels of IL-1-β and TNF-α were both elevated in the chronic compared to the non-chronic course group (χ2 = 7.77, p = 0.01 and χ2 = 11.69, p < 0.001, respectively). IgM was also elevated in the chronic course group (χ2 = 6.75, p = 0.01). There were no other significant between-group differences detected in any of the laboratory analyses (Table S5).Post-hoc Analyses Comparing Laboratory Tests in Asymptomatic and Symptomatic PatientsBecause of the relapsing–remitting nature of PANS, it is pertinent to further consider the symptomatic status of the patient when interpreting the results of the laboratory tests. In a post-hoc analysis, the participants were divided into an asymptomatic and a symptomatic group, depending on whether or not they presented active PANS symptoms at the time of follow-up.Twenty participants (59%) presented with active PANS symptoms at the time of follow-up. Similar to the comparison between chronic and non-chronic participants, levels of IL-1-β and TNF-α were also significantly elevated in the symptomatic compared to asymptomatic participants (χ2 = 4.89, p = 0.03 and χ2 = 3.87, p = 0.05, respectively). IgM was slightly elevated in symptomatic participants, but the difference was not statistically significant (χ2 = 2.32, p = 0.13). None of the asymptomatic participants had a positive throat culture (Table S5).DiscussionWe prospectively followed 34 patients for a period of 2-to-5 years, regardless of whether they were still active patients at our clinic or not. The latter was particularly important to limit the risk of selectively following-up chronic patients in need of medical attention. The main finding was that, although full remission was rare, the majority of children with PANS were significantly improved at the time of follow-up. Approximately 85% of the participants had much or very much improved PANS symptoms. Only a small proportion (15%) had clinically significant obsessive–compulsive symptoms at follow-up. Accordingly, the use of SSRIs and antipsychotics was relatively rare at follow-up. However, more than a third of the patients were classed as having a chronic course, and were still experiencing disabling symptoms requiring additional pharmacological and psychological interventions.Clinician-rated global functioning, disease severity and improvement scales all indicated significant improvement during the follow-up time, though patients and parents frequently reported persisting symptoms influencing everyday life. This apparent discrepancy between clinician and subjective ratings may suggest that our instruments do not capture the full extent of the patients’ difficulties. Alternatively, clinicians and families may interpret PANS symptoms differently. This is an important topic that requires further investigation, as it is critical for the design of clinical trials and the choice of appropriate outcome measures.A striking finding was that 38% of the participants had received an additional neuropsychiatric diagnosis during the follow-up period. Even though our naturalistic sample includes PANS patients with co-occurring autism and other severe psychiatric symptoms, thereby comprising a more complex patient group, the findings are similar to those of the Leon et al. PANDAS cohort [7]. They also reported that 33% of the participants had received a psychiatric diagnosis at follow-up, ADHD being the most common one. This highlights the importance of regular neuropsychiatric assessments in this patient group. The identification and correct diagnosis of these neuropsychiatric syndromes will facilitate the deployment of evidence-based interventions for specific problems, alongside any additional interventions required for PANS. An exclusive focus on PANS symptoms risks missing opportunities for intervention in other areas.In our clinic, all suspected PANS patients are routinely evaluated with extensive somatic assessments and laboratory analyses, which are both time-consuming and costly. At intake, these procedures may be important in order to exclude other, potentially treatable, conditions such as infections, autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, psoriasis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We previously reported baseline data for the cohort, showing high levels of somatic signs at intake (61% exhibiting skin abnormalities such as eczema or abrasions; 46% exhibiting signs of ear, nose or throat infections; and 23% showing neurological abnormalities including choreatic movements) [3]. However, at follow-up, the somatic findings were much rarer and often did not require a specific treatment. This suggests that the value of such a comprehensive assessment at follow-up may be limited, at least in routine clinical care. We suggest to mainly focus on signs of current infection. Because of the similarities between PANS and Sydenham’s chorea/rheumatic fever, we believe it is also advisable to routinely perform a heart auscultation, in order to rule out any murmurs indicative of heart inflammation.Published data of inflammatory markers in PANS patients are scarce and difficult to interpret, since the level of disease activity is rarely rated at the time of testing. Our findings indicate that thyroid abnormalities may be more frequent at follow-up (anti-TPO 19%, TSH abnormalities 15% and low T4 11%) than at baseline (anti-TPO 11%, TSH abnormalities 10% and low T4 0%) [3]. IL-1-β and TNF-α levels were significantly elevated in both symptomatic patients and chronic-static/progressive patients. Interestingly, none of the patients in the initial cohort had elevated IL-1-β and/or TNF-α levels at baseline [3]. In a naturalistic study describing the characteristics of the first 47 consecutive patients at the Stanford PANS clinic, Frankovich et al. reported positive Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANAs) in 28% of the patients fulfilling PANS criteria [2]. At baseline, we recorded positive ANAs in 17% of the patients [3], and at follow-up only in 7%. In the absence of robust biomarkers for PANS, these findings clearly indicate that the value of a of full laboratory work-up for clinical practice is currently limited. We suggest the full analyses should include measurement of CBC, thyroid, liver and kidney markers, inflammatory markers, IgG (including sub-classes), IgA and IgM, ANA, celiac test and throat culture at disease onset or when evaluating the need of potential immunomodulatory treatments. A smaller number of clinically relevant tests will suffice during the follow-up. These tests should be chosen based on current signs of infection, abnormalities in the initial work-up, comorbidities or ongoing pharmacological treatments.A novel aspect of our work is that we propose operational definitions of flare and clinical course in PANS, based on our long experience with this patient group. Previous definitions of flare and clinical course in patients with PANS/PANDAS are difficult to use in practice. Leon et al.defined a flare as a noticeable increase in a child’s previous PANDAS symptoms for a period of at least 24 h [7], which we consider problematic because this may risk capturing the natural waxing and waning of symptoms rather than a true flare. In a chart review of 218 consecutive patients at the Stanford PANS Clinic, Brown et al. defined a flare as an acute neuropsychiatric deterioration meeting strict PANS or PANDAS criteria, without the requirement of a specified time period [19], We believe that our proposed definition of a flare is more precise and, in our experience, easier to use in the clinic.Regarding previous definitions of clinical course, Brown et al. employed the following definitions: relapsing–remitting with flares and an approximate return to baseline without need for immunomodulatory treatment; chronic-static with unchanging symptoms lasting at least 9 months; and progressive as a chronic course worsening in intensity over time [19]. These definitions may be ambiguous, as a patient with a flare resolved after administration of an immunomodulatory treatment will be difficult to classify as either relapsing–remitting or chronic. Our proposed definitions will hopefully enable classification of different disease courses regardless of treatment given, an essential factor in the research setting and clinical practice alike.Despite the small sample size, our proposed definitions of flare and clinical course seemed to meaningfully distinguish the chronic and non-chronic course groups at follow-up regarding their level of impairment and subsequent need of healthcare resources. The groups also differed in some of the laboratory analyses (IL-1-β, TNF-α and IgM), but their clinical significance is currently unclear. However, as this represents a proinflammatory immune response, and there was also a link to autoimmunity (also caused by proinflammatory immune responses), further investigation of relative immune activation sensitivity is warranted to further explore patient subgroups. The chronic course group had an earlier onset, but follow-up time was comparable across the two groups; thus the natural course of the disorder is unlikely to explain the observed differences. Interestingly, the two groups had similar symptom severity at baseline but the chronic course group had significantly lower CGAS scores (i.e. more impairment), suggesting that both early onset and impaired function may potentially be useful predictors of chronicity in this patient group. The small sample size prevents further analyses of clinical characteristics predictive of disease course and prognosis, but we observed a trend towards higher rates of autoimmune or inflammatory comorbidity in the chronic course group. The identification of such predictive and prognostic factors should be a priority of future research with larger samples.To our knowledge, this is the first naturalistic long-term follow-up study of a well-characterized PANS cohort. The main limitation of the study is the small sample size. The follow-up assessments coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even smaller inclusion rate when previously consented participants wished to avoid visiting the clinic solely for research purposes. We had a particularly high data loss on the laboratory tests due to limited possibilities to travel to the laboratory to provide a blood sample. The baseline characteristics of the participants who were not available at follow-up were comparable to those of the participants who were available, somewhat mitigating this limitation. Finally, some of the measures administered at follow-up (e.g. CYBOCS and YGTSS) were not available at baseline, precluding certain longitudinal analyses.SummaryThis long-term follow-up study showed that, although full remission was rare, the majority of children with PANS were significantly improved over a mean 3-year follow-up period. However, a non-negligible minority of patients displayed a chronic-static/progressive course and required additional treatments. Interestingly, these treatments seldom concerned OCD or tics, as these symptoms seemed to remit during the follow-up in a large proportion of participants. The proposed operational definitions of flare and clinical course appeared to meaningfully distinguish the chronic and non-chronic groups at follow-up regarding their level of impairment and subsequent need of healthcare resources and may be useful in clinical practice, in future clinical trials, and in the development of treatment guidelines.Supplementary InformationBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Electronic supplementary material 1 (DOCX 13 kb)Electronic supplementary material 2 (DOCX 16 kb)Electronic supplementary material 3 (DOCX 14 kb)Electronic supplementary material 4 (DOCX 14 kb)Electronic supplementary material 5 (DOCX 16 kb)Publisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to children and their parents who participated in the research despite the ongoing global pandemic.Author ContributionsThe study was designed by CG and DMC.

Pre–post data (n=15 available) included global impression, quality of life, and psychiatric and IBD symptom scores. Referrer/patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness were retrospectively calculated. Psychological intervention led to reductions in IBD symptoms (ΔSIBD; p=0.003), alongside improvements in depression scores (ΔPHQ-9, p=0.006) and global impression (ΔCGI; p=0.046). Patient/referrer satisfaction was very high. Indicative data comparing service utilisation 1 year before and after engagement found reductions in outpatient appointments and in imaging. This small study suggests consideration of increased access to integrated psychological support services to improve outcomes and gather further evidence of efficacy.inflammatory bowel diseasepsychologyhealth service researchAbbiven/aBrighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trustn/aNational Institute Health ResearchCL-2015-27-002special-featureunlockedIntroductionInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a lifelong condition. Estimated annual incidence in Europe is 24.3 and 12.7 per 100 000 person-years for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, respectively. It can occur at any age, but is more common in younger people. Education, work, social and family life can all be disrupted by the unpredictable nature of debilitating and embarrassing symptoms. There is no ‘complete’ cure for IBD and many patients are on medications with unpleasant side effects, yet despite this end up needing invasive surgery with considerable impact on quality of life. Comorbid mood disorder can affect quality of life in patients with IBD.1 Unsurprisingly, patients with IBD are twice as likely to suffer from depression and are also more likely to have an anxiety disorder than other people.2 IBD standards have previously stated that a psychologist or counsellor is among the ‘essential supporting services’ that the IBD team should have access to.3 Furthermore, this has been identified locally at a trust level by the IBD Patient Panel as an area of priority need. Despite this, growing evidence suggests that psychological stress can increase activity of IBD.4 However, there is insufficient access to psychological support services for patients with IBD in the UK. Current evidence demonstrates that psychological therapies improve quality of life in the short term and supports the efficacy of antidepressant medication in improving disease activity.The aim of this pilot service (named Psychological Support Service for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PSSPIBD)) was to introduce integrated multidisciplinary psychiatric and psychological support for patients with IBD. It was hoped that by providing high-quality mental health support, we would improve patients’ psychological wellbeing, how they interact with services (by reducing inappropriate service use) and their quality of life. This service evaluation assessed the key assumption that providing tailored psychological support to patients with IBD will result in improved outcome measures across a ‘balanced scorecard’ of four dimensions: clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction and referrer satisfaction. Thus, it was our aim to demonstrateClinical effectiveness prospectively using validated questionnaires pre–post specialist psychological interventionCost-effectiveness retrospectively by indicatively evaluating service use prior to and after engagement with the service (PSSPIBD)Patient satisfaction by the use of qualitative feedback.Referrer satisfaction by the use of qualitative feedback.Methods and participantsA digestive disease centre at a teaching hospital secured funding to pilot a PSSPIBD, to provide outpatient psychiatric and psychological support to patients with IBD. Between October 2015 and March 2017, 75 patients were assessed and treated by PSSPIBD, staffed by a liaison psychiatrist (0.1WTE) and a band 7 clinical health psychologist (0.3WTE) with special interests in IBD, enhanced by a shadowing period spent within the centre. Referrals were made for patients experiencing psychological difficulties related to their IBD by medical staff IBD nurses, pharmacists and stoma nurses; either by letter or discussion with the liaison psychiatrist in the weekly IBD multidisciplinary meeting. The service was open to all patients with IBD using the centre for management of IBD.All patients referred were seen for an initial assessment unless they were already under the care of secondary mental health services.The most common reason for referral into the service was support adjusting to IBD and its symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, incontinence, tolerating uncertainty) (39%), followed by anxiety (31%) and low mood (8%) (figure 1A). Seventy-one per cent of patients seen were women.Figure 1Reasons for referral into the service (1A), patient flow diagram (1B). PSSPIBD, Psychological Support Service for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.A subgroup (n=15) of the service had complete questionnaire measurements before and after receiving psychological intervention by a clinical health psychologist. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was offered to support a range of difficulties, including lifting low mood, tolerating uncertainty, overcoming phobias and pain management. On average, patients received five sessions of CBT, although in practice this ranges from 1 session to 11 sessions. Validated questionnaires collected prospectively measured quality of life (EUROQoL), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and IBD symptoms (SIBD). In addition, clinicians rated patients globally (Clinical Global Impression, CGI).Given the small numbers, analysis of effectiveness of intervention of therapy (clinical and cost) was conducted by a related samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test in SPSS V.25 for Mac. Change in outcome scales were correlated using Spearman correlation. Cost-effectiveness was determined by indicative data comparing service use in 1 year before and after engaging with the PSSPIBD from one clinician using the service (MAS). This explored inpatient stays, emergency department attendance, radiological imaging, endoscopy and outpatient appointments pre–post. For statistical tests, a significance level of p≤0.05 was used. Patient and referrer feedback were assessed by invited questionnaire to all patients and referrers.ResultsFigure 1B explains the flow of patients assessed and treated by the service.Clinical effectivenessShort IBD Questionnaire (SIBD) scores pre-psychological and post-psychological therapy showed significant reductions in symptoms across all domains (p=0.003) with notable trend to improvement in bowel (p=0.067) and systemic symptoms (p=0.085) and significant improvements in emotional (p=0.004) and social functioning (p=0.046). Statistically significant improvements were seen in PHQ-9 depression score (p=0.006) and CGI (p=0.046), and there was a trend towards improvement in quality of life (EuroQoL) (p=0.058) (figure 2A–E).Figure 2Clinical effectiveness: statistically significant changes in patient outcomes post therapy: 1A mean SIBD (IBD symptoms) score (±1 SEM), 1B mean PHQ-9 (depression) score (±1 SEM) and 1C mean clinical global improvement (±1 SEM). Positive correlations 1D between improvement in quality of life and improvement in bowel symptoms and positive correlation 1E between reduction in anxiety and improvement in quality of life.Reduction in anxiety correlated with improvement in quality of life (r, 0.728 p=0.005) (figure 2E). There was a trend towards improvement in quality of life correlating with change in IBD symptoms (r, 0.502, p=0.056) (figure 2D).Service utilisationIndicative data comparing service use in 1 year before and after engaging with PSSPIBD found a statistically significantly reduction in outpatient appointments by 62.5% (p=0.010) and a strong trend in reduction of CT and MRI scans by 76.2% (p=0.058). No significant differences were found for inpatient bed days, emergency visits or endoscopy visits.Patient and referrer satisfactionPatient and referrer satisfaction with the service were very high: 90% of patients and all referrers completing the feedback rated the service as excellent (figure 3A, B).Figure 3Patient (A) and referrer (B) satisfaction with the service.DiscussionThe pilot service demonstrated significant improvements across all symptoms domains in patients with IBD, notably IBD and psychiatric symptomatology. This improvement is arguably comparable with that found with use of biologic agents.5 We demonstrated potential cost-effectiveness and high patient and referrer satisfaction.Our findings are in keeping with the literature that demonstrates a high degree of psychiatric and psychological morbidity in patients with IBD. Sadly, only a low proportion of patients with IBD have access to specialist psychiatric consultation and psychological therapy, with reasons being stigma of receiving a mental health service, lack of expertise and training in psychological assessment for many practitioners, and commissioning structures separating physical and mental health outcomes. To date, only three long-term conditions have an established evidence base of psychological need and care and psychological service innovations to meet such need: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary heart disease. It is anticipated as the evidence for psychological need and psychological effectiveness with patients with IBD grows, so too will the financial investment.LimitationsThe major limitation to this study is the small numbers and missing data. This is a problem with conducting rigorous service evaluation in a busy unit without dedicated research infrastructure support. There is a possibility of referral bias.In terms of bias, those patients with the most regular contact with the IBD team were perhaps more likely to be referred. This group will contain those who had more active IBD, but also those with health-related anxiety and potentially medically unexplained symptoms. We do not feel that this in any way invalidates the results as these are exactly the patients that we wanted to reach with this service and which other units would want to see results for.We believe there should be increased access to specialist integrated psychological support services across gastroenterology with the aim of gathering further evidence of success across all domains.Twitter: @bendybsmsPresented at: This study has previously been presented as a poster at the 13th Congress of ECCO (European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation)—Inflammatory Bowel Diseases 2018, Vienna (Austria), 14–17 February 2018, and as an oral communication at the British Society of Gastroenterology Annual Meeting 2018, Liverpool (UK), 4–7 June 2018, where it was selected as the Frontline Gastroenterology prizewinner for best patient benefit in gastroenterology.Contributors: JG set up the service with contribution from LAP and MAS.

Here, we assessed structural connectome development in a large longitudinal sample ranging from childhood to young adulthood. By projecting high-dimensional connectomes into compact manifold spaces, we identified a marked expansion of structural connectomes, with strongest effects in transmodal regions during adolescence. Findings reflected increased within-module connectivity together with increased segregation, indicating increasing differentiation of higher-order association networks from the rest of the brain. Projection of subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into these manifolds showed parallel alterations in pathways centered on the caudate and thalamus. Connectome findings were contextualized via spatial transcriptome association analysis, highlighting genes enriched in cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Statistical learning of cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their maturational change predicted measures of intelligence at follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that connectome manifold learning can bridge the conceptual and empirical gaps between macroscale network reconfigurations, microscale processes, and cognitive outcomes in adolescent development.connectomeneurodevelopmentadolescencelongitudinalneuroimagingmulti-scaleResearch organismHumanhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804Canada Research ChairsBernhardtBoris Chttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725National Research Foundation of KoreaNRF2020R1A6A3A03037088ParkBo-yongFonds de la Recherche du Quebec – SantéParkBo-yongPaquolaCaseyRodríguez-CrucesRaulBernhardtBoris CMontreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI)Molson Neuro-Engineering fellowshipParkBo-yonghttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000286British AcademyPost-Doctoral FellowshipBethlehemRichard AIAutism Research TrustBethlehemRichard AIhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchLarivièreSarahttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272National Institute for Health ResearchSenior Investigator awardBullmoreEdward Thttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNSERC Discovery-1304413BernhardtBoris Chttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchFDN-154298BernhardtBoris CSickKids FoundationNI17-039BernhardtBoris CAzrieli Center for Autism ResearchACAR-TACCBernhardtBoris CBrainCanadaBernhardtBoris CMNI-Cambridge collaborative awardParkBo-yongBethlehemRichard AIPaquolaCaseyBernhardtBoris CThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.Author impact statementManifold learning of longitudinal brain network data provides novel insights into adolescent structural connectome maturation, and how multiple scales of cortical and subcortical organization interact in typical neurodevelopment.IntroductionAdolescence is a time of profound and genetically mediated changes in whole-brain network organization (Larsen and Luna, 2018; Menon, 2013). Adolescent development is important for the maturation in cognitive and educational functions and brain health more generally, a notion reinforced by the overlapping onset of several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (Hong et al., 2019; Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Paus et al., 2008). With increased capacity to carry out longitudinal studies in large samples, it is now possible to track changes in brain network organization within subjects, providing insights into maturational processes, their biological underpinnings, and their effects on behavior and cognition.By offering an in vivo window into brain organization, neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer the ability to track adolescent brain development over time. Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in neurodevelopmental cohorts have focused on the analysis of morphological changes (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017), including MRI-based cortical thickness (Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017) and volumetric measures (Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017). Studies robustly show initial gray matter increases until mid-late childhood followed by a decline for the rest of the lifespan. During adolescence, cortical thickness decreases in widespread brain regions (Khundrakpam et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2006; Sotiras et al., 2017; Tamnes et al., 2017). Thus, contextualizing connectome alterations relative to established patterns of cortical thickness findings may establish whether inter-regional network changes occur above and beyond these diffuse effects of regional morphological maturation. More recent work explored changes in intracortical microstructure, capitalizing on myelin-sensitive contrasts such as magnetization transfer ratio (MT) mapping, which generally suggest overall increases in adolescence (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016) together with depth-dependent shifts in intracortical myelin profiles (Paquola et al., 2019a). Besides the increasingly recognized changes in cortico-cortical connectivity, studying subcortical regions offer additional insights for understanding brain maturation during adolescence. Indeed, an increasing body of connectome-level studies emphasizes that subcortical structures contribute significantly to patterns of whole-brain organization, dynamics, and cognition (Hwang et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2020; Shine et al., 2019). In prior neurodevelopmental studies, it has been shown that the volumes of the striatum and thalamus decrease between adolescence and adulthood, potentially paralleling processes resulting in cortical gray matter reduction during this time window (Herting et al., 2018). A close inter-relationship between cortical and subcortical development is also suggested by recent functional connectivity work suggesting that cortico-subcortical pathways are intrinsically remodeled during adolescence (Váša et al., 2020), and these changes affect cognitive functioning. Collectively, these prior findings suggest measurable trajectories of cortical and subcortical structural organization and support associations to cognitive development (Baum et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2006).Recent conceptual and methodological advances enable the study of brain organization, development, and substrates underlying cognitive trajectories in humans. One key modality to track developmental changes in structural connectivity is diffusion MRI (dMRI), a technique sensitive to the displacement of water in tissue that allows for the non-invasive approximation of inter-regional white matter tracts. Prior cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in children and adolescents outlined changes in the microstructure of major white matter tracts during development based on the analysis of dMRI-derived tissue parameters (Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Schmithorst and Yuan, 2010). These findings have been complemented by assessments of brain network topology using graph-theoretical analysis (Baker et al., 2015; Hagmann et al., 2010; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019), which reported a relatively preserved spatial layout of structural hubs across adolescent development on the one hand (Hagmann et al., 2010), yet with a continued strengthening of their connectivity profiles, likely underpinned by the ongoing maturation of long-range association fibers (Baker et al., 2015; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019).One emerging approach to address connectome organization and development comes from the application of manifold learning techniques to connectivity datasets. By decomposing whole-brain structural and functional connectomes into a series of lower dimensional axes capturing spatial gradients of connectivity variations, these techniques provide a compact perspective on large-scale connectome organization (Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019b; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). In addition, these techniques capture multiple, potentially overlapping gradients in connectivity along cortical mantle, which can represent both subregional heterogeneity and multiplicity within a brain region (Haak and Beckmann, 2020). In prior work, we showed that multiple dMRI gradients can illustrate structural underpinnings of dynamic functional communication in the adult human connectome (Park et al., 2021b). In line with prior conceptual accounts, the low-dimensional eigenvectors (i.e., gradients) derived from these techniques provide continuous dimensions of cortical organization, and thus the eigenvectors can jointly generate intrinsic coordinate systems of the brain based on connectivity (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018). Beyond these methodological considerations, prior work has shown that the principal gradients estimated from resting-state functional (Margulies et al., 2016), microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b), and diffusion MRI (Park et al., 2021a) all converge broadly along an established model of sensory-fugal hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998), allowing gradient mapping techniques to make conceptual contact to theories of cortical organization, development, and evolution (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969; Sanides, 1962). An emerging literature has indeed shown utility of the gradient framework to study primate evolution and cross-species alignment (Blazquez Freches et al., 2020; Valk et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020), neurodevelopment (Hong et al., 2019; Paquola et al., 2019a), as well as plasticity and structure-function coupling (Park et al., 2021b; Valk Sofie et al., 2020; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019). In a recent assessment by our team, manifold learning techniques have been applied to myelin sensitive intracortical MT data, showing an increasing myeloarchitectural differentiation of association cortex throughout adolescence (Paquola et al., 2019a). Still, the longitudinal maturation of dMRI connectomes in children and adolescents using manifold techniques has not been tracked.Imaging-transcriptomics approaches allow for the identification of cellular and molecular factors that co-vary with imaging-based findings (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2013). Recently established resources, such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2015), can be utilized to spatially associate macroscale imaging/connectome data with the expression patterns of thousands of genes. These findings have already been applied in the study of healthy adults (Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Park et al., 2020) and typically developing adolescents (Mascarell Maričić et al., 2020; Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014; Paquola et al., 2019a; Vértes et al., 2016; Whitaker et al., 2016), as well as individuals suffering from prevalent brain disorders (Altmann et al., 2018; Hashimoto et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2017; Park et al., 2021a; Patel et al., 2021; Romero-Garcia et al., 2019). The gene sets that co-vary with in vivo findings can furthermore be subjected to gene set enrichment analyses to discover potentially implicated molecular, cellular, and pathological processes (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2013; Dougherty et al., 2010; Kuleshov et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2019; Romero-Garcia et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2005). For example, studies in newborns have shown that cortical morphology reflects spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in fetuses, linking molecular mechanisms to in vivo measures of cortical development in early life (Ball et al., 2020). Work in adolescents has furthermore shown that developmental changes in regional cortical thickness measures and myelin proxies spatially co-localize with the expression patterns of genes involved in synaptic and oligodendroglial function (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016). Building on these prior investigations, the current study aimed at exploring whether adolescent structural connectome reconfigurations, assessed using manifold learning techniques, reflect the expression patterns of specific genes in order to identify potential molecular signatures of macroscale structural network development.Here, we charted developmental changes in structural connectome organization, based on an accelerated longitudinal neuroimaging study involving 208 participants investigated between 14 and 26 years of age (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). Compared to cross-sectional designs, longitudinal studies track within-subject change, separating developmental effects from between-subject variability (Louis et al., 1986). We first estimated longitudinal changes in structural connectome manifolds across age. This compact and lower dimensional space furthermore allowed for the integration of connectome-level findings with changes in MRI-based measures of cortical morphology and intracortical myelin. We furthermore projected subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into the manifold space to assess parallel developmental shifts of these pathways in the studied time window. Connectome manifold changes were contextualized at the molecular level via transcriptomic association and developmental enrichment analyses based on post-mortem datasets, which furthermore allowed for data-driven exploration of time windows of spatially co-localized gene sets. To also assess behavioral associations of connectome manifold changes, we utilized supervised machine learning to predict future measures of cognitive function quantified via the intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ is a widely used marker of general cognitive abilities, which shows good test–retest reliability (Brown and May, 1979; Watkins and Smith, 2013; Catron, 1978; G.-Matarazzo et al., 1973; Snow et al., 1989; Wagner and Caldwell, 1979) and has previously been applied to index overall cognitive function during development (Crespi, 2016; Garde et al., 2005; Garde et al., 2000; Koenis et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016; Ramsden et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020). In the study of neurodevelopment, neuroimaging reports have previously assessed associations between IQ and large-scale network measures in children to adolescents (Koenis et al., 2018; Ramsden et al., 2011; NSPN Consortium et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020). Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted at several steps to verify the robustness of our findings, and analytical code is made fully accessible to allow for independent replication of our findings.ResultsThese findings were based on the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN) cohort (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). In brief, we studied 208 healthy individuals enrolled in an accelerated longitudinal study, with approximately equal numbers of males and females in each of five age-related strata that collectively spanned the time period from 14 to 25 years coinciding with transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants (48% female) had a mean age of 18.82 years (range = 14–25 years) at baseline and 19.95 years (15–26 years) at follow-up. The average interval between baseline and follow-up scan was 11.28 months (range = 6–12 months). See Materials and methods for details on participant selection, image processing, and analysis.Macroscale structural connectome manifoldFor every participant, we built cortex-wide structural connectome manifolds formed by the eigenvectors displaying spatial gradients in structural connectome organization using non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques (Vos de Wael et al., 2020a; Vos de Wael et al., 2020b, https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace). Individual manifolds were aligned to a template manifold estimated from a hold-out dataset (see Materials and methods) (Langs et al., 2015; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). Three eigenvectors (E1, E2, and E3) explained approximately 50% of information in the template affinity matrix (i.e., 20.7/15.8/13.5% for E1/E2/E3, respectively), with each eigenvector showing a different axis of spatial variation across the cortical mantle (Figure 1A). Eigenvectors depicted a continuous differentiation between medial and lateral cortices (E1), between inferior and superior cortices (E2), and between anterior and posterior areas (E3). For each participant and time point, we calculated manifold eccentricity, which depicts how far each node is located from the center of the template manifold (see Materials and methods). It thus quantifies the changes in eigenvectors between the time points in terms of expansion and contraction instead of comparing multidimensional connectome manifolds (Bethlehem et al., 2020). The manifold eccentricity showed high values in frontal and somatomotor regions, while temporoparietal, visual, and limbic regions showed low values (Figure 1B).Figure 1.Structural connectome manifolds.(A) Systematic fiber tracking based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging generated a cortex-wide structural connectome, which was subjected to diffusion map embedding. As shown in the scree plot, three eigenvectors (E1, E2, E3) accounted for approximately 50% information of connectome data, and each depicted a different gradual transition across the cortical mantle. (B) Manifold eccentricity measured by Euclidean distance between the template center and each data point. Arrows depict average positional change in connectivity space from baseline to follow-up. The color of each arrow represents each brain region mapped on the surface on the bottom. (C) The histogram represents age distribution of all subjects at baseline and follow-up.

Three representative cases are reported. For details, see Figure 1.Figure 1—figure supplement 15.A schema of manifold eccentricity for three eigenvectors.Each dot in the scatter plot represents a single brain region, and the colors matched with regions on the brain surface. The triangle in the middle of the scatter plot is the manifold origin, and all brain regions (i.e., dots) are connected to the origin with lines. Manifold eccentricity of a given region is the length (i.e., Euclidean distance) of this line.Changes in manifold eccentricity across ageLeveraging linear mixed effect models that additionally controlled for effects of sex, site, head motion, and subject-specific random intercepts (Worsley et al., 2009), we assessed changes in manifold eccentricity across age (see Materials and methods). Manifold eccentricity expanded as age increased, especially in bilateral prefrontal and temporal areas, as well as left early visual and right lateral parietal cortices (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Figure 1C). Stratifying these effects along four cortical hierarchical levels, defined using an established taxonomy based on patterns of laminar differentiation and tract-tracing data in non-human primates (Mesulam, 1998), we identified peak effects in heteromodal association and paralimbic areas (Figure 1D). Convergent findings were observed when analyzing the effects with respect to intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), showing highest effects in default mode and limbic areas followed by visual and frontoparietal cortices. No significant contraction of manifold eccentricity was observed. In addition, we could not find any significant effects when we fitted the model with a quadratic form of age (i.e., age2), indicating the manifold eccentricity linearly increases across age.To conceptualize the findings derived from manifold eccentricity with respect to conventional network topologies, we correlated manifold eccentricity changes with several graph-theoretical measures of structural connectome (Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). We first defined six spatially contiguous clusters within the regions that showed significant age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (see Figure 1C) and correlated within-subject changes in manifold eccentricity with developmental changes in degree centrality, connectivity distance, and modular parameters (i.e., within-module degree and participation coefficient based on modules defined via Louvain’s community detection algorithm [Blondel et al., 2008]; see Materials and methods; Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We found significant positive associations for degree centrality and within-module degree, suggesting that connectome manifold expansion reflects a concurrent increase of overall connectivity, particularly within modules. Stratifying changes in manifold eccentricity, as well as connectome topology measures, according to the discretized age bins confirmed these age-related trends (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Indeed, except for participation coefficient, values in general increased from childhood to young adulthood.Effects of cortical morphology and microstructurePrevious studies demonstrated significant changes in cortical morphology and microstructure during adolescence, showing co-occurring reductions in cortical thickness and MT skewness, the latter being an index of depth-dependent intracortical myelin changes in multiple lobes (Gogtay et al., 2004; Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Paquola et al., 2019a; Shaw et al., 2006). We replicated these findings by showing cortical thinning in almost all brain regions across the studied age window as well as reductions in depth-dependent MT skewness, suggestive of supragranular enrichment of myelin (Figure 2A). To evaluate whether the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity were robust above and beyond these regional changes in cortical thickness and MT, we implemented linear mixed effect models including cortical thickness and MT as covariates in the analysis of developmental change in manifold eccentricity (Figure 2B). While we observed virtually identical spatial patterns of manifold eccentricity changes in models that controlled for thickness, MT skewness, and both, age-related effects in regions of significant manifold eccentricity findings (see Figure 1C) were reduced in models that additionally controlled for these covariates (average reduction of t-value in models controlling for thickness/MT skewness/both = 42/18/68%).Figure 2.Age-related effects on macro- and microstructural metrics of cortical anatomy.(A) The t-statistics of identified regions that showed significant age-related changes in cortical thickness (upper row) and magnetization transfer ratio MT (bottom row), and stratification of t-statistics according to cortical hierarchy (Mesulam, 1998) and functional community (Yeo et al., 2011). (B) Age-related changes in manifold eccentricity after controlling for cortical thickness and MT.Figure 2—source data 1.Source files for age-related changes in cortical thickness and magnetization transfer ratio.Age-related changes in subcortico-cortical connectivityBesides visualizing these changes in cortico-cortical connectivity, we also capitalized on the manifold representation to assess adolescent changes in the connectivity of subcortical regions, to obtain a more holistic insight into whole-brain connectome reconfigurations during this time period, and to examine whether subcortical connectivity patterns undergo parallel developmental trajectories (Hwang et al., 2017; Shine et al., 2019). Specifically, we assessed changes in subcortical-weighted manifolds across age, defined by projecting the streamline strength of subcortical regions to cortical targets to the manifold space (see Materials and methods). Such an analysis situates changes in subcortico-cortical pathways in the macroscale context of cortico-cortical connectivity identified in the previous analyses. After multiple comparisons correction, the caudate and thalamus showed significant age-related effects on subcortical-weighted manifolds (FDR < 0.05; Figure 3), and marginal effects were observed in the putamen, pallidum, and hippocampus (FDR < 0.1).Figure 3.Longitudinal changes in subcortical-weighted manifolds.The t-statistics of age-related changes in subcortical-weighted manifolds. The effects of each subcortical region are reported on the radar plot. FDR: false discovery rate.Figure 3—source data 1.Source files for age-related changes in subcortical-weighted manifolds.Transcriptomic association analysisConnectome organization, in general, and macroscale gradients, in particular, have been argued to reflect genetic expression profiles, underscoring the close link between the physical layout of the brain and innate transcriptional patterning (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Fornito et al., 2019). Here, we carried out a transcriptomic association analysis and developmental enrichment analyses to contextualize the age-related manifold eccentricity changes with respect to patterns of post-mortem gene expression from a sample of independent adults (Figure 4A). Specifically, leveraging mixed effect models, we associated the spatial patterns of manifold change across age in the NSPN sample (controlling for covariation of cortical thickness and MT) with cortical maps of post-mortem gene expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2015; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Markello et al., 2020). Among the list of most strongly associated genes (FDR < 0.05), we selected only genes that were consistently expressed across different donors (r > 0.5) (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Markello et al., 2020; Supplementary file 1). We performed developmental gene set enrichment analysis using the cell-type-specific expression analysis (CSEA) tool, which compares the selected gene list with developmental enrichment profiles (see Materials and methods) (Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014). This analysis highlights developmental time windows across macroscopic brain regions in which genes are strongly expressed. We found marked expression of the genes enriched from childhood onward in the cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum (FDR < 0.001; Figure 4B). Although signal was reduced, genes were also enriched for expression in the striatum at the transition from childhood to adolescence (FDR < 0.05). On the other hand, identified genes were not found to be expressed in the hippocampus and amygdala.Figure 4.Transcriptomic analysis.(A) Gene decoding process by associating t-statistics from the linear mixed effect model with post-mortem gene expression maps. (B) We identified genes that were spatially correlated with the input t-statistic map (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) and selected only those that were furthermore consistently expressed across different donors (r > 0.5). These genes were input to a developmental enrichment analysis, showing strong associations with cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum during the childhood-to-adulthood time window. The degree of gene expression for developmental windows is reported on the bottom. The curve represents log transformed FDR-corrected p-values, averaged across the brain regions for each of the time windows reported on the bottom. ***FDR < 0.001, ** FDR < 0.01, *FDR < 0.05.Figure 4—source data 1.Source files for developmental enrichment profiles.Association between connectome manifold and cognitive functionFinally, to establish associations between connectome reconfigurations and cognitive functioning, we utilized supervised machine learning to predict full IQ at follow-up using manifold eccentricity features. Independent variables were combinations of cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their age-related trajectory data. We used elastic net regularization with nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005) (see Materials and methods), and repeated the prediction 100 times with different training and test dataset compositions to mitigate subject selection bias. Across cross-validation and iterations, 6.24 ± 5.74 (mean ± SD) features were selected to predict IQ using manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline, 6.20 ± 5.14 cortical features at baseline and maturational change, 5.45 ± 5.99 cortical and subcortical features at baseline, and 5.16 ± 5.43 at baseline and maturational change, suggesting that adding more independent variables may not per se lead to improvement in prediction accuracy. The manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline significantly predicted future IQ score (mean ± SD r = 0.14 ± 0.04; mean absolute error [MAE] = 8.93 ± 0.16, p=0.09). Prediction performance was slightly improved when we combined the manifold eccentricity both at baseline and differences between follow-up and baseline (r = 0.18 ± 0.04; MAE = 9.10 ± 0.19, p=0.04) (Figure 5A). Notably, prediction accuracy was improved if we additionally considered subcortical manifold features (baseline: r = 0.17 ± 0.03; MAE = 8.74 ± 0.11, p=0.04; baseline and maturational change: r = 0.21 ± 0.02; MAE = 8.86 ± 0.14, p=0.01) (Figure 5B). The regions showing strongest predictive validity for IQ were prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, as well as the caudate and thalamus. The probability map of the selected brain regions (bottom right of Figure 5B) was further decoded using Neurosynth (Yarkoni et al., 2011), revealing strong associations with higher-order cognitive and social terms (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We compared the prediction performance of our model with a baseline model, where IQ of the test set was simple average of training set (r = −0.15 ± 0.06, MAE = 8.98 ± 0.04, p=0.12; see Materials and methods). We found that our model outperformed this baseline model (Meng’s z-test p < 0.001) (Meng et al., 1992). We also predicted the change of IQ between the baseline and follow-up, instead of IQ at follow-up, using the imaging features. However, we could not find significant results.Figure 5.Intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction by baseline and follow-up measures of cortical and subcortical manifolds.(A) Probability of selected brain regions across ten-fold cross-validation and 100 repetitions for predicting future IQ using only baseline manifold eccentricity (left), and both baseline and maturational change in the feature (right).

For details, see Figure 5.Sensitivity analysisSpatial scaleRepeating the longitudinal modeling with a different spatial scale (i.e., 300 parcels), findings were highly consistent (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).Site and sex effectsFurthermore, manifold eccentricity of the identified cortical regions and age consistently correlated positively across different sites and within both biological sexes, yielding non-significant interaction effects (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).Different parameters for diffusion map embeddingWhen we changed parameters of diffusion map embedding for generating connectome manifolds (see Materials and methods), t-statistic maps of age-related changes in manifold eccentricity were largely consistent (mean ± SD linear correlation r = 0.92 ± 0.10).Gradient alignment fidelityWhen calculating linear correlations between template and individual manifolds before and after alignment, we found significant increases after alignment (r = 0.92 ± 0.03/0.93 ± 0.03/0.94 ± 0.03) compared to before alignment (−0.02 ± 0.03/–0.001 ± 0.37/0.003 ± 0.12) for E1/E2/E3, respectively, supporting effectiveness of alignment. After excluding 10% of subjects with poor alignment (cutoff r = 0.83; the new set was correlated with the template manifold, r = 0.94 ± 0.01), we found consistent age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 6), with the t-statistic map showing strong correlation to the map derived in the whole sample (r = 0.97, p<0.001).Connectome manifold generation using principal component analysisIn a separate analysis, we generated eigenvectors using principal component analysis (Wold et al., 1987), instead of diffusion map embedding (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), and found consistent spatial maps (linear correlation = 0.998 ± 0.001 across E1/E2/E3; Figure 1—figure supplement 7A) and longitudinal findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).Longitudinal changes in graph-theoretical measuresRepeating the longitudinal modeling using graph-theoretical centrality measures, we found significant age-related longitudinal changes in degree and eigenvector centrality, while betweenness centrality did not reveal significant effects, in similar regions to those that had significant age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Correlating the effect size maps for manifold eccentricity and each graph measure, we found a significant yet variable spatial similarity of the effect maps (betweenness centrality: r = 0.18, spin-test p = 0.02; degree centrality: r = 0.57, p < 0.001; eigenvector centrality: r = 0.47, p < 0.001).Manifold eccentricity based on all eigenvectorsRepeating manifold eccentricity calculation and age modeling using all eigenvectors, instead of using only the first three, we observed relatively consistent results with our original findings (linear correlation of manifold eccentricity r = 0.54, p<0.001; t-statistic map r = 0.68, p<0.001), also pointing to manifold expansion in transmodal cortices (Figure 1—figure supplement 9).Robustness of group representative structural connectomeWe compared gradients derived from the group representative structural connectome, based on (i) distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019) and (ii) consistency thresholding (Wang et al., 2019; Figure 1—figure supplement 10). We found high similarity in spatial maps of the estimated manifolds (r = 0.89 ± 0.01 for E1; 0.93 ± 0.004 for E2; 0.85 ± 0.01 for E3 across six different thresholds), indicating robustness.Connectome manifolds based on structural parcellationWe repeated our analyses with a structural parcellation, defined using a sub-parcellation of folding based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a; Figure 1—figure supplement 11). Despite slight differences in the topography of manifold eccentricity in lateral prefrontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, we could replicate strong age-related effects in heteromodal association areas, together with effects in caudate and hippocampus (FDR < 0.05), and marginally in thalamus (FDR < 0.1).Longitudinal modeling using edge weightsRepeating the longitudinal modeling across age using connectome edge weights, we found significant increases in edge weights within frontoparietal and default mode networks, as well as in attention and sensory networks (FDR < 0.05; Figure 1—figure supplement 12), consistent with findings based on manifold eccentricity.Manifold eccentricity and pubertal stagesWe repeated the longitudinal modeling within a subset of participants who completed the Tanner scale (n = 73) (Marshall and Tanner, 1970; Marshall and Tanner, 1969) and found relatively consistent albeit weaker age-related changes in manifold eccentricity as for the overall sample (Figure 1—figure supplement 13A). Notably, manifold eccentricity within the identified regions derived from overall sample and Tanner scale revealed a significant interaction effect (t = 2.36, p=0.01; Figure 1—figure supplement 13B), suggesting that participants in early pubertal stages show more marked changes in manifold eccentricity across age compared to those in later stages.IQ prediction using nonlinear modelWe predicted IQ at follow-up using a regression tree method (Breiman et al., 1984), instead of linear regression model, but we could not find improved prediction performance (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).DiscussionThe current study tracked whole-brain structural connectome maturation from adolescence to young adulthood in an accelerated longitudinal imaging cohort (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). Capitalizing on advanced manifold learning techniques applied to dMRI-derived connectomes, we established that higher-order association cortices in prefrontal, medial and superior temporal areas, as well as parieto-occipital regions, expanded in their connectome manifold representation indicative of an increased differentiation of these systems from the rest of the brain in adolescence. Parallel topological analysis based on graph theory indicated that these changes anatomically coincided with increases in the within-module connectivity of transmodal cortices. Findings were consistent across the different acquisition sites and biological sexes, and similar albeit slightly weaker when correcting connectivity manifolds for MRI-based measures of macrostructure (cortical thickness) and microstructure (skewness of MT depth profile). In addition to the cortical manifold expansion, we found parallel reconfigurations of subcortical connectivity patterns for the caudate and thalamus. Decoding our findings with post-mortem gene expression maps implicated genes enriched in adolescence and young adulthood, again pointing to both cortical as well as subcortical targets. Finally, the combination of both cortical and subcortical manifold measures predicted behavioral measures of intelligence at follow-up, with higher performance than cortical or subcortical data alone. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into adolescent structural connectome maturation and indicate how multiple scales of cortical and subcortical organization can interact in typical neurodevelopment.Leveraging advanced manifold learning, we depicted macroscale connectome organization along continuous cortical axes. Similar approaches have previously been harnessed to decompose microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b; Paquola et al., 2019a) and functional MRI (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2019; Margulies et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2019; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). These techniques are appealing as they offer a low-dimensional perspective on connectome reconfigurations in a data-driven and spatially unconstrained manner. In our longitudinal study, we could identify marked connectome expansion during adolescence, mainly encompassing transmodal and heteromodal association cortex in prefrontal, temporal, and posterior regions, the territories known to mature later in development (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006). Findings remained consistent when we considered a linear dimensionality reduction technique, suggesting robustness to methodological details of this analysis. Connectome expansion can be understood as an overall greater differentiation of the connectivity of these areas from the rest of the brain as they would then cover wider portions of the corresponding manifold space. Manifold expansion in higher-order areas correlated with an increase in their within-module connectivity, but not with participation coefficient and connectivity distance measures that would be more reflective of their between-module connectivity. In light of potential limitations of dMRI tractography in detecting long-distance fiber tracts (Betzel et al., 2019; Maier-Hein et al., 2017), we cannot rule out a reduced sensitivity of our approach for the study of long-range inter-regional connections. Nevertheless, our diffusion modeling was based on constrained spherical-deconvolution approaches together with SIFT2-based tractogram filtering, in addition to using a distance-dependent thresholding approach that may have partially mitigated these limitations (Betzel et al., 2019). Thus, our findings do overall confirm and extend prior dMRI studies that have focused on specific tracts and that have indicated considerable developmental shifts in diffusion parameters, such as increases in fractional anisotropy and decreases in mean diffusivity in early and late adolescence (Olson et al., 2009). Other studies have furthermore reported increased streamline count estimates (Genc et al., 2020). In this context, our macroscale manifold findings likely reflect an ongoing consolidation of transmodal cortical communities. These findings align with prior graph-theoretical studies, which have pointed to concurrent increases in network integration and consolidation of network hubs from late childhood to early adulthood (Baker et al., 2015; Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011; Oldham and Fornito, 2019). Considering their distributed regional substrate, these network effects are likely driven by the ongoing maturation of fiber bundles that interconnect these higher-order cortices, including superior longitudinal fascicules, but also thalamic and basal ganglia pathways (Tamnes et al., 2010), throughout adolescence.Projecting manifold solutions back onto cortical surfaces allowed us to integrate our connectome manifold results with morphometric and intracortical intensity indices obtained via structural and quantitative MRI contrasts in the same participants. We were thus able to balance the network-level effects against trajectories of intracortical remodeling. Longitudinal changes in these cortical features were overall in agreement with prior work, suggesting marked reductions in cortical thickness in adolescence (Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Shaw et al., 2006), possibly reflecting synaptic pruning processes (Petanjek et al., 2011) together with decreases in the skewness of intracortical MT profiles, a feature sensitive to preferential myelination of supragranular layers (Paquola et al., 2019a). Although we still observed significant age-related changes in manifold eccentricity after controlling for these intracortical and morphological measures, the effect sizes of our findings were reduced. This effect was particularly evident when running a parallel analysis that additionally controlled for depth-dependent shifts in cortical microstructure, a finding in line with more generally demonstrated links between cortical microstructural depth profiles and inter-regional connectivity (Paquola et al., 2019b). In the context of adolescence and prior findings in the NSPN dataset (Paquola et al., 2019a), these results thus suggest a coupled process that affects depth-dependent shifts in cortical myeloarchitecture, on the one hand, and adolescent shifts in macroscale connectome organization, on the other hand, as shown by our longitudinal manifold analyses.In addition to emphasizing a distributed set of association cortices and their cortico-cortical connections, analysis of subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns highlighted parallel developmental processes in several subcortical structures and their connections, particularly the caudate and thalamus. These findings were independently supported by transcriptomic association studies and developmental enrichment analyses, which implicated genes expressed in cortical regions and these subcortical structures during late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. The caudate nucleus of the striatum has long been recognized to play an important role in mediating large-scale cortical network organization (Aglioti, 1997; Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Graybiel, 1995), a finding also increasingly recognized in the connectome literature (Hwang et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2020; Shine et al., 2019). It is known to modulate activity in prefrontal association areas during memory-driven internal thought processes (Aglioti, 1997), and higher-order cognitive functions, notably motivational processes, decision making, as well as cognitive control and executive functions more generally (Aglioti, 1997; Graybiel, 1995). Regions of the striatum participate in dense cortico-subcortical feedback loops and exchange neural activity through dense connections with adjacent basal ganglia structures as well as the thalamus (Aglioti, 1997; Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Shine, 2021). Associating macroscopic changes in manifold eccentricity with post-mortem microarray data provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2013), we identified gene sets expressed in cortical regions and subcortical structures of the thalamus and striatum during late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Despite these findings being associative and based on separate datasets, they overall support our results that brain network maturation from late childhood until early adulthood implicates micro- and macroscale factors in both subcortical and cortical networks. Coupled network and molecular changes may ultimately change subcortical and cortical circuit properties, including the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Human brain development involves spatio-temporal waves of gene expression changes across different brain regions and developmental time windows (Ip et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2018). In the study of adolescent development, prior studies have suggested shifts in E/I balance, evolving from a dominant inhibitory bias in early developmental stages towards stronger excitatory drive in later stages, and suggested that these may underlie the maturation of cognitive functions such as working memory and executive control (Dorrn et al., 2010; Lander et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2007). In common neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, imbalances in cortical E/I and cortico-subcortical network function have been demonstrated (Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Gandal et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2005; Nelson and Valakh, 2015; Park et al., 2021a; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Trakoshis et al., 2020), potentially downstream to perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems, such as interneuron-mediated GABA transmission (Bonaventura et al., 2017; Kilb, 2012; Liu et al., 2007; Park et al., 2021a; Silveri et al., 2013; Trakoshis et al., 2020; Tziortzi et al., 2014).Higher-order cognitive function implicates functionally relevant whole-brain network mechanisms, and its prediction may thus leverage structurally governed principles of network integration and segregation. Application of a supervised machine learning framework with cross-validation and regularization to our cohort demonstrated that it is possible to predict inter-individual variations in future IQ from structural connectome manifold data. These findings complement conceptual accounts linking brain organization to cognitive function (Margulies et al., 2016; Mesulam, 1998) and earlier efforts to predict IQ measures from inter-regional measures of connectivity and graph-theoretical indices of network topology (Greene et al., 2018). Notably, evaluations of several feature combinations highlighted that predictive performance was highest when including both baseline and trajectory data, and when complementing cortical and subcortical manifold features. These findings re-emphasize the benefits of incorporating subcortical nodes in the characterization of large-scale cortical network organization and overall cognitive function (Alves et al., 2019; Müller et al., 2020; Shine, 2021; Shine et al., 2019). Of note, although our model significantly outperformed a baseline model, the relationship between the actual and predicted IQ scores did not locate on the equality line and the strength of the association was rather weak. Further improvements in brain-based IQ prediction in adolescence, for example, through combinations of structural and functional imaging features, will be a focus of future work.Adolescence is a time characterized by ongoing brain changes (Baum et al., 2020; Gogtay et al., 2004; Larsen and Luna, 2018; Menon, 2013; Shaw et al., 2006), gradually increasing independence from caregivers, accompanied by strong increments in knowledge and our ability to think more abstractly and to cooperate with our peers to achieve common goals. On the other hand, adolescence is also a sensitive time window for risk taking, the development of addictions, and is associated with high rates of onset of several psychiatric disorders (Hong et al., 2019; Khundrakpam et al., 2017). Our study has shown that structural brain network organization continues to mature significantly during this time period, with higher-order association cortices in prefrontal and posterior regions especially showing an expansion of their corresponding connectome manifold signature. Findings were related to an increased strengthening of intra-community connectivity as well as cortico-subcortical connectivity to thalamo-striatal regions. Although the current work was restricted to a longitudinal sample of typically developing adolescents, our framework may be useful to explore multiscale network perturbations in cohorts with a psychiatric diagnosis or those at risk for addiction or atypical neurodevelopment.Materials and methodsParticipantsWe obtained imaging and phenotypic data from the NSPN 2400 cohort, which contains questionnaire data on 2402 individuals (with MRI data on a subset of ~300) from adolescence to young adulthood in a longitudinal setting (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016). The NSPN study was ethically approved by the National Research Ethics Service and conducted in accordance with NHS research governance standards. All participants provided informed consent in writing, with additional parental consent for participants aged less than 16 years at enrollment. Included participants completed quality-controlled (see Data preprocessing section) multimodal MRI scans consisting of T1-weighted, MT, and dMRI for at least two time points. Our final sample consisted of a total of 208 participants (48% female; mean [range] age = 18.82 [14–25] years at baseline and 19.95 [15–26] at follow-up; inter-scan interval of 11.28 [6–12] months), collected from three different UK sites: Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre and MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge; and University College London. We divided the participants into template and non-template cohorts with matched age, sex, and site ratio. The template dataset (n = 30; 50% female; mean [range] age = 18.69 [15–24] years at baseline and 19.84 ± 2.66 [16–25] at follow-up) was used for constructing the group mean template manifold and the non-template dataset (n = 178; 47% female; mean [range] age = 18.84 [14–25] years at baseline and 19.97 [15–26] at follow-up) was used for conducting main analyses. Of note, changing the template dataset composition did not markedly affect main findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 14).MRI acquisitionImaging data were obtained using Siemens Magnetom TIM Trio 3T scanners. T1-weighted and MT sequences were acquired using a quantitative multiparameter mapping sequence (repetition time [TR]/flip angle = 18.7 ms/20° for T1-weighted and 23.7 ms/6° for MT; six equidistance echo times [TE] = 2.2–14.7 ms; voxel size = 1 mm3; 176 slices; field of view [FOV] = 256 × 240 mm; matrix size = 256 × 240 × 176) (Weiskopf et al., 2013). The dMRI data were acquired using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (TR = 8700 ms; TE = 90 ms; flip angle = 90°; voxel size = 2 mm3; 70 slices; FOV = 192 × 192 mm2; matrix size = 96 × 96 × 70; b-value = 1000 s/mm2; 63 diffusion directions; and 6 b0 images).Data preprocessingT1-weighted data were processed using the fusion of neuroimaging preprocessing (FuNP) pipeline integrating AFNI, FSL, FreeSurfer, ANTs, and Workbench (Avants et al., 2011; Cox, 1996; Fischl, 2012; Glasser et al., 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2012; Park et al., 2019), which is similar to the minimal preprocessing pipeline for the Human Connectome Project (Glasser et al., 2013). Gradient nonlinearity and b0 distortion correction, non-brain tissue removal, and intensity normalization were performed. The white matter and pial surfaces were generated by following the boundaries between different tissues (Dale et al., 1999), and they were averaged to generate the midthickness contour, which was used to generate the inflated surface. The spherical surface was registered to the Conte69 template with 164k vertices (Van Essen et al., 2012) and downsampled to a 32k vertex mesh. Quality control involved visual inspection of surface reconstruction of T1-weighted data, and cases with faulty cortical segmentation were excluded. Surface-based co-registration between T1-weighted and MT weighted scans was performed. We generated 14 equivolumetric cortical surfaces within the cortex and sampled MT intensity along these surfaces (Paquola et al., 2019a). The vertex-wise MT profiles for each surface depth were averaged based on the Schaefer atlas with 200 parcels (Schaefer et al., 2018). The dMRI data were processed using MRtrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019), including correction for susceptibility distortions, head motion, and eddy currents. We visually inspected the quality of co-registration between the adolescence data and adult-driven surface template as well as parcellation atlas, and all data showed reasonable registration results.Structural connectome manifold identificationStructural connectomes were generated from preprocessed dMRI data (Tournier et al., 2019). Anatomically constrained tractography was performed using different tissue types derived from the T1-weighted image, including cortical and subcortical gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (Smith et al., 2012). Multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions were estimated (Christiaens et al., 2015), and constrained spherical-deconvolution and intensity normalization were performed (Jeurissen et al., 2014). The tractogram was generated with 40 million streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. Subsequently, spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) was applied to reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by the cross-section multipliers, which considers the fiber bundle’s total intra-axonal space across its full cross-sectional extent (Smith et al., 2015). The structural connectome was built by mapping the reconstructed cross-section streamlines onto the Schaefer 7-network based atlas with 200 parcels (Schaefer et al., 2018) then log-transformed to adjust for the scale (Fornito et al., 2016). We opted for this atlas as it (i) allows contextualization of our findings within macroscale intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), (ii) incorporates the option to assess results across different granularities, and (iii) aligns the current study with previous work from our group (Benkarim et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021b; Park et al., 2021a; Rodríguez-Cruces et al., 2020) and others (Baum et al., 2020; Betzel et al., 2019; Osmanlıoğlu et al., 2019).Cortex-wide structural connectome manifolds were identified using BrainSpace (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). First, a template manifold was estimated using a group representative structural connectome of the template dataset. The group representative structural connectome was defined using a distance-dependent thresholding that preserves long-range connections (Betzel et al., 2019). An affinity matrix was constructed with a normalized angle kernel, and eigenvectors were estimated via diffusion map embedding (Figure 1A), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman and Lafon, 2006) that projects connectome features into low-dimensional manifolds (Margulies et al., 2016). This technique is only controlled by a few parameters, computationally efficient, and relatively robust to noise compared to other nonlinear techniques (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000), and has been extensively used in the previous gradient mapping literature (Hong et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2020; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020a; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019a; Park et al., 2021b; Valk et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). It is controlled by two parameters α and t, where α controls the influence of the density of sampling points on the manifold (α = 0, maximal influence; α = 1, no influence) and t controls the scale of eigenvalues of the diffusion operator. We set α = 0.5 and t = 0 to retain the global relations between data points in the embedded space, following prior applications (Hong et al., 2019; Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019a; Paquola et al., 2019b; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). Briefly, the eigenvectors estimated from the decomposition technique generate a connectivity coordinate system (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018) – the diffusion map, where Euclidean distances in the manifold correspond to diffusion times between the nodes of the network (Coifman and Lafon, 2006). In this manifold space, interconnected brain regions with similar connectivity patterns are closely located, and regions with weak similarity in connectivity patterns are located farther apart. After generating the template manifold, individual-level manifolds were estimated from the non-template dataset and aligned to the template manifold via Procrustes alignment (Langs et al., 2015; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a). To analyze change in the low-dimensional manifold space, we simplified the multivariate eigenvectors into a single scalar value that is., manifold eccentricity (Figure 1B). Manifold eccentricity was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the manifold origin and all data points (i.e., brain regions) in manifold space. The template center was defined as the centroid of the first three eigenvectors, which explained 50% variance. Specifically, manifold eccentricity was defined as follows:(1)CT=1N∑i=1NTE1i,∑i=1NTE2i,∑i=1NTE3i(2)ME=∑e=13IEe-CTe2CT is the template manifold origin, N the number of brain regions, T∙ the template manifold, ME the manifold eccentricity, I∙ the individual manifold, and CTe the origin of e-th template manifold. Simply, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 15, each brain region (i.e., each dot in the scatter plot) is described as a vector from the manifold origin (i.e., triangular mark in the scatter plot), and manifold eccentricity is simply a length (i.e., Euclidean distance) of that vector. Shifts in connectivity patterns of a given region thus will lead to shifts in the vectors, which in turn changes the manifold eccentricity. Thus, manifold eccentricity quantifies global brain organization based in the connectivity space.Age-related changes in structural manifoldsWe assessed changes in manifold eccentricity across age using a linear mixed effect model (Worsley et al., 2009), controlling for effects of sex, site, head motion, and subject-specific random intercept to improve model fit in accelerated longitudinal designs. The t-statistics of each brain region were computed, and we corrected for multiple comparisons by using an FDR threshold of q < 0.05 (Figure 1C; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We stratified age-related effects based on a seminal model of neural organization and laminar differentiation that contains four cortical hierarchical levels (Mesulam, 1998), as well as seven intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011; Figure 1D). To assess the effects with respect to age2, we repeated implementing a linear mixed effect model by adding a quadratic term of age to the model.To provide the underlying structure of manifold eccentricity, we compared the changes in manifold eccentricity with those in connectome topology measures. We first defined clusters within the identified regions based on their spatial boundaries (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Then, we calculated degree centrality, as well as modular measures of within-module degree and participation coefficient using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) and connectivity distance using a recently published approach (Larivière et al., 2020b). Degree centrality is defined as the row-wise sum of the weighted connectivity matrix, representing the connection strength of a given node (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Connectivity distance is a given brain region’s geodesic distance to its structurally connected brain areas within the cortex (Oligschläger et al., 2019), and it is defined as the multiplication between the geodesic distance and the binarized structural connectome (Hong et al., 2019; Oligschläger et al., 2019). Within-module degree and participation coefficient are nodal measures reflecting different facets of community organization (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). For each individual subject, community structure was defined using Louvain’s algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) and a consistency matrix was constructed, where each element of the matrix represents whether the two different nodes are involved in the same community (i.e., 1) or not (i.e., 0) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). We constructed the group-wise consistency matrix by averaging the consistency matrix of all subjects and applied k-means clustering (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The optimal number of clusters was determined using the silhouette coefficient, that is, the k that maximized the silhouette coefficient (Kannan et al., 2010). We calculated within-module degree and participation coefficient based on these modules. Within-module degree is the degree centrality within a community, indicating intra-community connection strength, while participation coefficient represents inter-community connectivity (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). We calculated linear correlations between changes in manifold eccentricity and those in each graph-theoretical measure for each cluster (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). The significance of the correlation was corrected using 1000 permutation tests by randomly shuffling subject indices in one of the data vectors, and we corrected for multiple comparisons across clusters using an FDR procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). To visualize age-related changes in these parameters, we stratified each measure according to discretized age bins (<17, 17–19, 19–21, 21–23, ≥23; Figure 1—figure supplement 3).Cortical morphology and microstructureIt has been shown that macroscale cortical morphology and microstructure significantly change during development (Gogtay et al., 2004; Khundrakpam et al., 2017; Paquola et al., 2019a; Shaw et al., 2006). Here, we confirmed these changes by assessing age-related changes in MRI-based cortical thickness measures and intracortical measures of MT, an index sensitive to myelin content (Weiskopf et al., 2013), using linear mixed effect models (Figure 2A; Worsley et al., 2009). We further regressed out cortical thickness and MT from the connectome manifold eccentricity metric. We then implemented linear mixed effect models using the residuals of manifold measures to assess whether age-related connectome manifold effects exist above and beyond age-related effects on cortical morphology and microstructure (Figure 2B).Subcortico-cortical connectivityTo assess age-related changes in subcortical manifold organizations in addition to cortical manifold structures, we first parcellated the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus for each individual (Patenaude et al., 2011), and approximated cross-sectionl streamlines connect each subcortical region to the rest of the brain. For each individual and each subcortical region, we projected the streamline strength to cortical manifold space by weighting the cortical manifolds with the streamline strength of the connection between each subcortical region and cortical parcels, yielding a matrix with the form of (number of brain regions × number of cortical manifolds). We averaged the matrix across the axis of cortical manifolds to construct subcortical-weighted manifold vector. We assessed age-related changes in the subcortical-weighted manifold using a linear mixed effect model (Worsley et al., 2009), controlling for sex, site, head motion, and subject-specific random intercept, and FDR corrected for multiple comparisons (Figure 3; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).Transcriptomic analysisWe performed spatial correlation analysis to post-mortem gene expression data and carried out a developmental enrichment analysis (Figure 4). In brief, we first correlated the t-statistics map, which represents age-related changes in manifold eccentricity that controlled for cortical morphology and microstructure, with the post-mortem gene expression maps provided by the Allen Institute using the Neurovault gene decoding tool (Gorgolewski et al., 2015; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2012). Leveraging mixed effect models to associate the input t-statistic map with the genes of six donor brains, Neurovault yields the gene symbols associated with the input spatial map. Gene symbols that passed for a significance level of FDR < 0.05 were further tested whether they are consistently expressed across different donors using abagen toolbox (Markello et al., 2020; copy archived at https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen; Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2012). For each gene, we estimated whole-brain gene expression map and correlated it between all pairs of donors. Leveraging CSEA developmental expression tool (http://genetics.wustl.edu/jdlab/csea-tool-2; Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014), we evaluated the significance of overlap between the genes showing consistent whole-brain expression pattern across donors (FDR < 0.05) with RNAseq data obtained from BrainSpan dataset (http://www.brainspan.org). The significance was calculated based on Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922) with FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The CSEA tool provides simplified results of gene enrichment profiles along six major brain regions (i.e., cortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala) across 10 developmental periods (from early fetal to young adulthood) approximated from mouse data, yielding a total of 60 combinations of developmental enrichment profiles (Xu et al., 2014). We repeated developmental enrichment analysis using the genes identified from the rotated maps of the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (100 spherical rotations). For each iteration, we obtained developmental expression profiles using the identified genes, where the FDR-corrected p-values built a null distribution. For each brain division and developmental period, if the actual p-value is placed outside 95% of the null distribution, it was deemed significant. As the Allen Brain Institute repository is composed of adult post-mortem datasets, it should be noted that the associated gene symbols represent indirect associations with the input t-statistic map derived from the developmental data.Association with the development of cognitive functionLeveraging a supervised machine learning with ten-fold cross-validation, we predicted full IQ score measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler, 1999) at follow-up using cortical and subcortical features. Four different feature sets were evaluated: (i) manifold eccentricity of the identified cortical regions at baseline and (ii) manifold eccentricity at baseline and its longitudinal change (i.e., differences between follow-up and baseline), and (iii) cortical manifold eccentricity and subcortical-weighted manifold of the identified regions at baseline and (iv) manifold eccentricity and subcortical-weighted manifold at baseline and their longitudinal changes. For each evaluation, a subset of features that could predict future IQ was identified using elastic net regularization (ρ=0.5) with optimized regularization parameters (L1 and L2 penalty terms) via nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005). We split the dataset into training (9/10) and test (1/10) partitions, and each training partition was further split into inner training and testing folds using another ten-fold cross-validation. Within the inner fold, elastic net regularization finds a set of non-redundant features to explain the dependent variable. Using a linear regression, we predicted the IQ scores of inner fold test data using the features of the selected brain regions by controlling for age, sex, site, and head motion. The model with minimum MAE across the inner folds was applied to the test partition of the outer fold, and the IQ scores of outer fold test data were predicted. The prediction procedure was repeated 100 times with different training and test sets to reduce subject selection bias. Prediction accuracy was indexed by computing linear correlations between the actual and predicted IQ scores as well as MAE. A 95% confidence interval of the accuracy measures was also reported. Permutation-based correlations across 1000 tests were conducted by randomly shuffling subject indices to check whether the prediction performance exceeded chance levels. To assess whether our model outperforms baseline model, we predicted IQ of test data using average of IQ of training data (i.e., predicted IQ = mean(training set IQ)). The improvement of prediction performance was assessed using Meng’s z-test (Meng et al., 1992). In addition to predicting future IQ, we performed the same prediction analysis to predict the change of IQ between the baseline and follow-up.Sensitivity analysisSpatial scaleTo assess the consistency of our findings across spatial scales, we additionally performed the linear mixed effect modeling using a finer parcellation scheme of 300 parcels (Figure 1—figure supplement 4; Schaefer et al., 2018).Site and sex effectParticipants were recruited from three different sites. To assess whether the longitudinal changes in manifold eccentricity across age are consistent across different sites, we calculated interaction effects of the relationship between age and manifold eccentricity of the identified regions across sites (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B). In addition, we computed interaction effect of the relationship between age and manifold eccentricity across male and female subjects to assess whether the age-related changes are affected by biological sexes (Figure 1—figure supplement 5C).Different parameters for diffusion map embeddingTo assess the sensitivity of our findings, we generated connectome manifolds with different parameters for diffusion map embedding (α = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75; t = 0, 1, 2, 3). We assessed age-related changes of the newly defined manifold eccentricity and calculated linear correlation with t-statistic map of the default setting (α = 0.5; t = 0; Figure 1C).Gradient alignment fidelityTo assess robustness of individual alignment, we computed linear correlations between the template and individual manifolds before and after alignment. We also repeated the linear mixed effect modeling after excluding 10% of subjects with the lowest alignment to the template manifold (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).Connectome manifold generation using principal component analysisTo explore consistency of our results when using different dimensionality reduction techniques, we generated connectome manifolds using principal component analysis (Wold et al., 1987), instead of relying on diffusion map embedding (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), and performed longitudinal modeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). We compared the eigenvectors estimated from diffusion map embedding and principal component analysis using linear correlations.Longitudinal changes in graph-theoretical measuresTo compare longitudinal changes in manifold eccentricity with those in graph-theoretical centrality measures, we calculated betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality of the structural connectomes and built similar linear mixed effects models to assess longitudinal change (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Betweenness centrality is the number of weighted shortest paths between any combinations of nodes that run through that node, degree centrality is the sum of edge weights connected to a given node, and eigenvector centrality measures the influence of a node in the whole network (Lohmann et al., 2010; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Zuo et al., 2012). Spatial similarity between t-statistics of centrality and manifold measures was assessed with 1000 spin tests that account for spatial autocorrelation (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018).Manifold eccentricity analysis based on all eigenvectorsWe repeated our analysis by calculating manifold eccentricity from all eigenvectors to assess consistency of the findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 9).Robustness of group representative structural connectomeWe compared the distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019) that was adopted for the main analysis with a consistency thresholding approach (Wang et al., 2019). The latter averages subject-specific matrices, in addition to performing a 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10% thresholding, as well as simple averaging (i.e., 0% thresholding) (Figure 1—figure supplement 10).Connectome manifolds based on structural parcellationTo confirm whether functional and structural parcellation schemes yield consistent results, we repeated our main analyses using 200 cortical nodes structural parcellation scheme, which preserves the macroscopic boundaries of the Desikan–Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Vos de Wael et al., 2020a; Figure 1—figure supplement 11).Longitudinal modeling using edge weightsIn addition to the analyses based on manifold eccentricity, linear mixed effect modeling using connectome edge weights assessed age-related longitudinal changes in streamline strength (Figure 1—figure supplement 12).Manifold eccentricity and pubertal stagesTo assess the relationship between manifold eccentricity and pubertal stages, we selected a subset of participants who completed Tanner scale (Marshall and Tanner, 1970; Marshall and Tanner, 1969), which quantifies pubertal stages from 1 (pre-puberty) to 5 (final phase of physical maturation). However, the score was collected at baseline and for 73/208 participants only. To confirm robustness, we performed linear mixed effect modeling using this subset (Figure 1—figure supplement 13A). In addition, we assessed interaction effects of Tanner scale and manifold eccentricity restricted to the regions identified from the overall sample (Figure 1—figure supplement 13B).IQ prediction using nonlinear modelWe additionally predicted future IQ score using decision tree learning, a nonlinear approach that builds a regression tree model a root node and split leaf nodes, where the leaf nodes contain the response variables (Breiman et al., 1984; Figure 5—figure supplement 2).Data and code availabilityThe imaging and phenotypic data were provided by the NSPN 2400 cohort.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ben Fulcher (Reviewer #3).The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as eLife papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.Summary:This manuscript describes a longitudinal study of the adolescent structural connectome. Park et al. report on an analysis of existing semi-longitudinal NSPN 2400 data to learn how the projections of high-dimensional structural connectivity patterns onto a three-dimensional subspace change with age during adolescence. They employ a non-linear manifold learning algorithm (diffusion embedding), thereby linking the maturation of global structural connectivity patterns to an emerging approach in understanding brain organization through spatial gradient representations. The authors find strong effects of expansion of structural connectomes in transmodal brain regions during adolescence. They also report findings centered on the caudate and thalamus, and supplement the structural connectivity analyses with transcriptome association analyses revealing gens enriched in specific brain regions. Finally, intelligence measures are predicted from baseline structural measures.This is an interesting and comprehensive set of analyses on an important topic. Overall, the figures are lovely. The sensitivity analyses are particularly commendable.The paper is well written, the data are fantastic, and the analyses are interesting. Some suggestions and points for clarification (both theoretical and methodological) are below.Essential revisions:– There is not much in the introduction about why co-localized gene sets are of interest to explore. What is already known about brain development using this approach, and how does the current work fill a gap in our knowledge?– Similarly, the introduction states that the study aims to \"predict future measures of cognitive function\". What cognitive functions specifically were of interest in this study, and why? No rationale or background is provided for conducting these analyses.– The authors claim that their study examines \"the entire adolescent time period\", however some would argue that age 14 does not represent the earliest age at which adolescence onsets. I think it would be more accurate to say the study covers the mid to late adolescent period.– In the results it is stated that three eigenvector explained approximately 50% of the variance in the template affinity matrix. Here it would be helpful to report exactly how much of the variance was explained by each (E1, E2, E3).– Pubertal development occurs across the age range investigated, and affects brain structure and function. Was information on pubertal stage of participants available? Did some participants undergo changes in pubertal status from timepoint 1 to timepoint 2?– The introduction does not mention cortical thickness much, therefore these analyses come as a bit of surprise in the results.– As in the introduction, there is not much interpretation of the transcriptome findings in the discussion.– For constructing the structural connectome, the Schaefer 7-network atlas was utilized. Can the authors comment on why a functional atlas (rather than a structural atlas) was used here?– While this work touches on an important topic, ties nicely with the increasing body of papers on global brain gradients, and its overall conclusions are warranted, I am not (yet) convinced that it offers fundamentally new insights that could not have been gleaned from previous work (after all, manifold learning simply displays a shadow of the underlying patterns; if the patterns change, so does their shadow). I am also not convinced by the rationale for employing diffusion embedding: the authors state that the ensuing gradients are heritable, conserved across species, capture functional activation patterns during task states, and provide a coordinate system to interrogate brain structure and function, but that would be true for any method that adequately captures biologically meaningful variance in the structural connectivity patterns.– The authors show that the maturational change of the manifold features predict intelligence at follow-up but did not show that intelligence itself exhibited changes that exceeded the error bounds of the regression line. Why not predict IQ change?– The slight improvements in prediction accuracy observed after adding maturational change and subcortical features to the features at baseline will necessarily happen by adding more regression parameters and may not be meaningful.– Interpretability and Lack of ComparisonThe authors claim repeatedly that they are \"capitalizing on advanced manifold learning techniques\".One could imagine an infinite number of papers that take a dataset, use a technique to extract a metric, X (e.g., eccentricity), and then write about the changes in X with some property of interest, Y (e.g., age). Given this set of papers (and the non-independence between the set of possible Xs), the reader ought to be most interested in those Xs that provide the best performance and simplest interpretation, with other papers being redundant.Thus, a nuanced approach to presenting a paper like this is to demonstrate that the metric used represents an advance over alternative, simpler-to-compute, or clearer-to-interpret metrics that already exist.In this paper, however, the authors do not demonstrate the benefits of their particular choice of applying a specific nonlinear dimensionality reduction method using 3 dimensions alignment to a template manifold and then computing an eccentricity metric. For example:i. Is the nonlinearity required (e.g., does it outperform PCA or MDS)?ii. Is there something special about picking 3 dimensions to do the eccentricity calculation? Is dimensionality reduction required at all (e.g., would you get similar results by computing eccentricity in the full-dimensional space?)iii. Does it outperform basic connectome measures (e.g., the simple ones the authors compute)?There is a clear down-side of how opaque the approach is (and thus difficult to interpret relative to, say, connectivity degree), so one would hope for a correspondingly strong boost in performance. The authors could also do more to develop some intuition for the idea of a low-dimensional connection-pattern-similarity-space, and how to interpret taking Euclidean distances within such a space.– Developmental Enrichment AnalysisBoth in the main text and in the Materials and methods, this is described as \"genes were fed into a developmental enrichment analysis\". Can some explanation be provided as to what happens between the \"feeding in\" and what comes out? Without clearly described methods, it is impossible to interpret or critique this component of the paper. If the methodological details are opaque, then the significance of the results could be tested numerically relative to some randomized null inputs being 'fed in' to demonstrate specificity of the tested phenotype.– IQ predictionThe predictions seem to be very poor (equality lines, y = x, should be drawn in Figure 5, to show what perfect predictions would look like; linear regressions are not helpful for a prediction task, and are deceptive of the appropriate MAE computation). The authors do not perform any comparisons in this section (even to a real baseline model like `predicted_IQ = mean(training_set_IQ)`). They also do not perform statistical tests (or quote p-values), but nevertheless make a range of claims, including of \"significant prediction\" or \"prediction accuracy was improved\", \"reemphasize the benefits of incorporating subcortical nodes\", etc. All of these claims should be tested relative to rigorous statistics, and comparisons to appropriate baseline/benchmark approaches.– Group ConnectomeGiven how much the paper relies on estimating a group structural connectome, it should be visualized and characterized. For example, a basic analysis of the distribution of edge weights and degree, especially as edge weights can vary over orders of magnitude and high weights (more likely to be short distances) may therefore unduly dominate some of the low-dimensional components. The authors may also consider testing robustness performed to alternative ways of estimating the connectome [e.g., Oldham et al. NeuroImage 222, 117252 (2020)] and its group-level summary [e.g., Roberts et al. NeuroImage 145, 1-42 (2016)].– Individual AlignmentThe paper relies on individuals being successfully aligned to the template manifold. Accordingly, some analysis should be performed quantifying how well individuals could be mapped. Presumably some subjects fit very well onto the template, whereas others do not. Is there something interesting about the poorly aligned subjects? Do your results improve when excluding them?10.7554/eLife.64694.sa2Author responseEssential revisions:– There is not much in the introduction about why co-localized gene sets are of interest to explore. What is already known about brain development using this approach, and how does the current work fill a gap in our knowledge?We updated Introduction by adding a new paragraph motivating the transcriptomic analysis and outlining the novelty of our work:“Imaging-transcriptomics approaches allow for the identification of cellular and molecular factors that co-vary with imaging-based findings (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2013). Recently established resources, such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Hawrylycz et al., 2015), can be utilized to spatially associate macroscale imaging/connectome data with the expression patterns of thousands of genes. These findings have already been applied in the study of healthy adults (Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Park et al., 2020b; Q. Xu et al., 2020) and typically developing adolescents (Mascarell Maričić et al., 2020; Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014; Paquola et al., 2019a; Vértes et al., 2016; Whitaker et al., 2016), as well as individuals suffering from prevalent brain disorders (Altmann et al., 2018; Hashimoto et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020a; Patel et al., 2021; Romero-Garcia et al., 2019). The gene sets that co-vary with in vivo findings can furthermore be subjected to gene set enrichment analyses to discover potentially implicated molecular, cellular, and pathological processes (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2013; Dougherty et al., 2010; Kuleshov et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2019; Romero-Garcia et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2005). For example, studies in newborns have shown that cortical morphology reflects spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in foetuses, linking molecular mechanisms to in vivo measures of cortical development in early life (Ball et al., 2020). Work in adolescents has furthermore shown that developmental changes in regional cortical thickness measures and myelin proxies spatially co-localize with the expression patterns of genes involved in synaptic and oligodendroglial function (Paquola et al., 2019a; Whitaker et al., 2016). Building on these prior investigations, the current study aimed at exploring whether adolescent structural connectome reconfigurations, assessed using manifold learning techniques, reflect the expression patterns of specific genes, in order to identify potential molecular signatures of macroscale structural network development.”– Similarly, the introduction states that the study aims to \"predict future measures of cognitive function\". What cognitive functions specifically were of interest in this study, and why? No rationale or background is provided for conducting these analyses.We thank the Reviewers for this comment.We incorporated additional justification and details on the cognitive prediction in the Introduction:“To also assess behavioral associations of connectome manifold changes, we utilized supervised machine learning to predict future measures of cognitive function quantified via the intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ is a widely used marker of general cognitive abilities, which shows good test-retest reliability (Brown and May, 1979; Canivez and Watkins, 1998; Catron, 1978; Matarazzo et al., 1973; Snow et al., 1989; Wagner and Caldwell, 1979) and has previously been applied to index overall cognitive function during development (Crespi, 2016; Garde et al., 2005, 2000; Koenis et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016; Ramsden et al., 2011; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020). In the study of neurodevelopment, neuroimaging reports have previously assessed associations between IQ and large-scale network measures in children to adolescents (Koenis et al., 2018; Ramsden et al., 2011; Seidlitz et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2006; Suprano et al., 2020).”– The authors claim that their study examines \"the entire adolescent time period\", however some would argue that age 14 does not represent the earliest age at which adolescence onsets. I think it would be more accurate to say the study covers the mid to late adolescent period.We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment.We clarified the sample in the Introduction:“Here, we charted developmental changes in structural connectome organization, based on an accelerated longitudinal neuroimaging study involving 208 participants investigated between 14 to 26 years of age (Kiddle et al., 2018; Whitaker et al., 2016)”– In the results it is stated that three eigenvector explained approximately 50% of the variance in the template affinity matrix. Here it would be helpful to report exactly how much of the variance was explained by each (E1, E2, E3).As suggested, we provided further details in the Results:“Three eigenvectors (E1, E2, and E3) explained approximately 50% of information in the template affinity matrix (i.e., 20.7/15.8/13.5% for E1/E2/E3, respectively), with each eigenvector showing a different axis of spatial variation across the cortical mantle (Figure 1A).”– Pubertal development occurs across the age range investigated, and affects brain structure and function. Was information on pubertal stage of participants available? Did some participants undergo changes in pubertal status from timepoint 1 to timepoint 2?The NSPN consortium collected Tanner scale (Marshall and Tanner, 1970, 1969), which quantifies pubertal stages from 1 (pre-puberty) to 5 (final phase of physical maturation). However, the score was collected at baseline and for 73/208 participants only. We could thus not assess longitudinal changes in manifold features according to changes in pubertal stages indexed by Tanner staging. Nevertheless, linear mixed effect modeling in the subset of these 73 participants confirmed our overall findings. While the statistical power was reduced in this smaller subset, spatial patterns of age-effects were consistent with the larger sample (Figure 1—figure supplement 13A). Notably, manifold eccentricity within the identified regions derived from overall sample and Tanner scale revealed significant interaction effect (t = 2.36, p = 0.01; Figure 1—figure supplement 13B), suggesting participants in early pubertal stage show stronger changes in manifold eccentricity across age compared to those in later stages.We updated the Results:“k) Manifold eccentricity and pubertal stages. We repeated the longitudinal modeling within a subset of participants who completed the Tanner scale (n = 73) (Marshall and Tanner, 1970, 1969), and found relatively consistent albeit weaker age-related changes in manifold eccentricity as for the overall sample (Figure 1—figure supplement 13A). Notably, manifold eccentricity within the identified regions derived from overall sample and Tanner scale revealed a significant interaction effect (t = 2.36, p = 0.01; Figure 1—figure supplement 13B), suggesting participants in early pubertal stages show more marked changes in manifold eccentricity across age compared to those in later stages.”as well as Materials and methods:“k) Manifold eccentricity and pubertal stages. To assess the relationship between manifold eccentricity and pubertal stages, we selected a subset of participants who completed Tanner scale (Marshall and Tanner, 1970, 1969), which quantifies pubertal stages from 1 (pre-puberty) to 5 (final phase of physical maturation). However, the score was collected at baseline and for 73/208 participants only. To confirm robustness, we performed linear mixed effect modeling using this subset (Figure 1—figure supplement 13A). In addition, we assessed interaction effects of Tanner scale and manifold eccentricity restricted to the regions identified from the overall sample (Figure 1—figure supplement 13B).”– The introduction does not mention cortical thickness much, therefore these analyses come as a bit of surprise in the results.As suggested, we now contextualize adolescent cortical thickness changes in the Introduction:“Early cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in neurodevelopmental cohorts focused on the analysis of morphological changes (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017), including MRI-based cortical thickness (Shaw et al., 2006; Tamnes et al., 2017) and volumetric measures (Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017). Studies robustly show initial grey matter increases until mid-late childhood followed by a decline for the rest of the lifespan. During adolescence, cortical thickness decreases in widespread brain regions (Khundrakpam et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2006; Sotiras et al., 2017; Tamnes et al., 2017). Thus, contextualizing connectome alterations relative to established patterns of cortical thickness findings may establish whether inter-regional network changes occur above and beyond these diffuse effects of regional morphological maturation.”– As in the introduction, there is not much interpretation of the transcriptome findings in the discussion.As suggested, we expanded our interpretation of the transcriptome findings in the Discussion:“Associating macroscopic changes in manifold eccentricity with post-mortem microarray data provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019; Fornito et al., 2019; Gorgolewski et al., 2014; Hawrylycz et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2013), we identified gene sets expressed in cortical regions and subcortical structures of the thalamus and striatum during late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Despite these findings being associative and based on separate datasets, they overall support our results that brain network maturation from late childhood until early adulthood implicates micro- and macroscale factors in both subcortical and cortical networks. Coupled network and molecular changes may ultimately change subcortical and cortical circuit properties, including the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Human brain development involves spatio-temporal waves of gene expression changes across different brain regions and developmental time windows (Ip et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2018). In the study of adolescent development, prior studies have suggested shifts in E/I balance, evolving from a dominant inhibitory bias in early developmental stages towards stronger excitatory drive in later stages, and suggested that these may underlie the maturation of cognitive functions such as working memory and executive control (Dorrn et al., 2010; Lander et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2007). In common neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, imbalances in cortical E/I and cortico-subcortical network function have been demonstrated (Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Gandal et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2005; Nelson and Valakh, 2015; Park et al., 2020a; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Trakoshis et al., 2020), potentially downstream to perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems, such as interneuron-mediated GABA transmission (Bonaventura et al., 2017; Kilb, 2012; Liu et al., 2007; Park et al., 2020a; Silveri et al., 2013; Trakoshis et al., 2020; Tziortzi et al., 2014).”– For constructing the structural connectome, the Schaefer 7-network atlas was utilized. Can the authors comment on why a functional atlas (rather than a structural atlas) was used here?We opted for the widely used Schaefer parcellation (Schaefer et al., 2018) as it (i) allows contextualization of our findings within the context of intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), (ii) incorporates the option to assess results across different parcel numbers, and (iii) aligns the current study with prior work from our group (Benkarim et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021, 2020a; Rodríguez-Cruces et al., 2020) and others (Baum et al., 2020; Betzel et al., 2019; Osmanlıoğlu et al., 2019).This justification is now included in the Materials and methods:“We opted for this atlas as it (i) allows contextualization of our findings within macroscale intrinsic functional communities (Yeo et al., 2011), (ii) incorporates the option to assess results across different granularities, and (iii) aligns the current study with previous work from our group (Benkarim et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021, 2020a; Rodríguez-Cruces et al., 2020) and others (Baum et al., 2020; Betzel et al., 2019; Osmanlıoğlu et al., 2019).”We agree with the reviewer that diffusion MRI studies have often been conducted based on structural atlases. We thus repeated our analyses using a structural parcellation scheme with 200 nodes that preserves the macroscopic boundaries of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). We found largely consistent age-effects on manifold eccentricity and subcortical-weighted manifold in heteromodal association areas, as well as in caudate, hippocampus, and thalamus (Figure 1—figure supplement 11).We updated Results:“i) Connectome manifolds based on structural parcellation. We repeated our analyses with a structural parcellation, defined using a sub-parcellation of folding based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Vos de Wael et al., 2020) (Figure 1—figure supplement 11). Despite slight differences in the topography of manifold eccentricity in lateral prefrontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, we could replicate strong age-related effects in heteromodal association areas, together with effects in caudate and hippocampus (FDR < 0.05), and marginally in thalamus (FDR < 0.1).”as well as Materials and methods:“i) Connectome manifolds based on structural parcellation. To confirm whether functional and structural parcellation schemes yield consistent results, we repeated our main analyses using 200 cortical nodes structural parcellation scheme, which preserves the macroscopic boundaries of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Vos de Wael et al., 2020) (Figure 1—figure supplement 11).”– While this work touches on an important topic, ties nicely with the increasing body of papers on global brain gradients, and its overall conclusions are warranted, I am not (yet) convinced that it offers fundamentally new insights that could not have been gleaned from previous work (after all, manifold learning simply displays a shadow of the underlying patterns; if the patterns change, so does their shadow). I am also not convinced by the rationale for employing diffusion embedding: the authors state that the ensuing gradients are heritable, conserved across species, capture functional activation patterns during task states, and provide a coordinate system to interrogate brain structure and function, but that would be true for any method that adequately captures biologically meaningful variance in the structural connectivity patterns.We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work and happy to provide further rationale for the use of gradients. Being derived from connectomes, we agree that gradient mapping techniques do, in part, recapitulate findings that have been previously shown with more established techniques, for example, graph-theoretical analyses that consider the brain as a graph with nodes and edges and estimate connectome patterns by calculating graph parameters, such as centrality and modular measures (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). However, we believe that gradient mapping approaches offer a promising combination of methodological and conceptual properties: (i) Gradient mapping based on manifold learning approaches reduce high dimensional (i.e., n x n) connectomes into a series of k spatial maps (i.e., gradients, each of the form n x 1) in a data-driven way and thus provide a simplified view on large-scale connectome organization. Of note, the dimensionality reduction procedure we opted for (i.e., diffusion map embedding) is computationally efficient and robust to noise when computing a globally optimal solution compared to linear approaches (Tenenbaum et al., 2000). (ii) As in the current work, the solution of these techniques is not necessarily a single gradient, but it can be multiple, potentially overlapping gradients. Representing multiple gradients has been suggested to offer the ability to characterize both subregional heterogeneity and functional multiplicity of brain regions (Haak and Beckmann, 2020). In prior work, we showed that the use of multiple diffusion MRI gradients can help to better understand dynamic functional communication patterns in the adult human brain connectome (Park et al., 2021). (iii) As the gradients derived from these techniques can serve as continuous axes of cortical organization, the use of several gradients jointly allows to generate intrinsic coordinate systems in connectivity space, in line with prior conceptual accounts (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018). (iv) In addition to the aforementioned methodological advances, prior work has shown that principal gradients, e.g., those estimated from task-free functional MRI (Margulies et al., 2016), follow established models of cortical hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998). These observations have allowed gradient mapping approaches to make conceptual contact with seminal work on cortical organization, evolution, and development (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969, 1962). What’s more, an emerging literature has shown utility of the gradient framework to study primate evolution and cross-species alignment (Blazquez Freches et al., 2020; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020; T. Xu et al., 2020), neurodevelopment (Hong et al., 2019; Paquola et al., 2019a), as well as plasticity and structure-function coupling (Park et al., 2021; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019).We updated Introduction:“One emerging approach to address connectome organization and development comes from the application of manifold learning techniques to connectivity datasets. […] An emerging literature has indeed shown utility of the gradient framework to study primate evolution and cross-species alignment (Blazquez Freches et al., 2020; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020; T. Xu et al., 2020), neurodevelopment (Hong et al., 2019; Paquola et al., 2019a), as well as plasticity and structure-function coupling (Park et al., 2021; Sofie L Valk et al., 2020; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019).”To build cortex-wide structural connectome manifolds, our work opted for diffusion map embedding, a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), following a seminal connectivity gradient study (Margulies et al., 2016). Follow-up work from our group and others adopted the same approach (Hong et al., 2019, 2020; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019a; Park et al., 2021; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). In addition to ensuring continuity with these prior studies, non-linear techniques do in general explain more information with the same number of components than linear techniques, which may increase performance on group classification, cluster identification, and phenotypic score prediction (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020). Diffusion map embedding, in particular, is only controlled by few parameters, and thus computationally efficient and rather robust to noise (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000). Of note, the non-linearity is simply introduced by running the singular value decomposition, which is also at the heart of PCA, on the Markov matrix of the normalized connectome, which also lends a direct interpretation to the reduced manifold as being interpretable as a ‘diffusion map’ between the nodes.We nevertheless agree with the Reviewer’s point that non-linear and linear techniques often converge, and that it is not fully established which approach should be prioritized (Hong et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). To assess consistency, we thus repeated our analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA) and observed consistent manifold dimensions (linear correlation = 0.998 ± 0.001 across E1/E2/E3; Figure 1—figure supplement 7A), as well as similar age-effects as in the main analysis, notably a similar expansion of the manifold space (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).We updated Results:“e) Connectome manifold generation using principal component analysis. In a separate analysis, we generated eigenvectors using principal component analysis (Wold et al., 1987), instead of diffusion map embedding (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), and found consistent spatial maps (linear correlation = 0.998 ± 0.001 across E1/E2/E3; Figure 1—figure supplement 7A) and longitudinal findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).”as well as Materials and methods:“An affinity matrix was constructed with a normalized angle kernel, and eigenvectors were estimated via diffusion map embedding (Figure 1A), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman and Lafon, 2006) that projects connectome features into low dimensional manifolds (Margulies et al., 2016). This technique is only controlled by few parameters, computationally efficient, and relatively robust to noise compared to other non-linear techniques (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000), and has been extensively used in the previous gradient mapping literature (Hong et al., 2019, 2020; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020a; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019a; Park et al., 2021; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020).”“e) Connectome manifold generation using principal component analysis. To explore consistency of our results when using different dimensionality reduction techniques, we generated connectome manifolds using principal component analysis (Wold et al., 1987), instead of relying on diffusion map embedding (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), and performed longitudinal modeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). We compared the eigenvectors estimated from diffusion map embedding and principal component analysis using linear correlations.”– The authors show that the maturational change of the manifold features predict intelligence at follow-up, but did not show that intelligence itself exhibited changes that exceeded the error bounds of the regression line. Why not predict IQ change?As suggested, we additionally predicted the change of IQ between the baseline and follow-up, instead of IQ at follow-up, using the imaging features. However, we could not find significant results for predicting ∆IQ using cortical features at baseline (mean ± SD r = -0.10 ± 0.04, MAE = 6.62 ± 0.06, p = 0.27) nor at both baseline and maturational change (r = -0.08 ± 0.04, MAE = 6.60 ± 0.06, p = 0.34). Adding subcortical regions did not improve the performance (baseline: r = -0.01 ± 0.03, MAE = 7.02 ± 0.12, p = 0.73; baseline and maturational change: r = 0.03 ± 0.03, MAE = 6.53 ± 0.06, p = 0.67). The low performance might be due to small variations in ∆IQ, where many participants (42%) showed IQ changes less than 5 and 76% less than 10.We updated Results:“We also predicted the change of IQ between the baseline and follow-up, instead of IQ at follow-up, using the imaging features. However, we could not find significant results.”as well as Materials and methods:“In addition to predicting future IQ, we performed the same prediction analysis to predict the change of IQ between the baseline and follow-up.”– The slight improvements in prediction accuracy observed after adding maturational change and subcortical features to the features at baseline will necessarily happen by adding more regression parameters and may not be meaningful.To improve robustness of prediction analysis, as well as avoid overfitting, the revised work employed a nested ten-fold cross-validation framework (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006) with elastic net regularization (Zou and Hastie, 2005). Specifically, we split the dataset into training (9/10) and test (1/10) partitions, and each training partition was further split into inner training and testing folds using another ten-fold cross-validation. Within the inner fold, elastic net regularization finds a set of non-redundant features to explain the dependent variable. Using a linear regression, we predicted the IQ scores of inner fold test data using the features of the selected brain regions by controlling for age, sex, site, and head motion. The model with minimum mean absolute error (MAE) across the inner folds was applied to the test partition of the outer fold, and the IQ scores of outer fold test data were predicted. The prediction procedure was repeated 100 times with different training and test sets to reduce subject selection bias. Across cross-validation and iterations, 6.24 ± 5.74 (mean ± SD) features were selected to predict IQ using manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline, 6.20 ± 5.14 cortical features at baseline and maturational change, 5.45 ± 5.99 cortical and subcortical features at baseline, and 5.16 ± 5.43 at baseline and maturational change. In this scenario, adding more independent variables may not per se lead to improvement in prediction accuracy.We updated Results:“We used elastic net regularization with nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005) (see Methods), and repeated the prediction 100 times with different training and test dataset compositions to mitigate subject selection bias. Across cross-validation and iterations, 6.24 ± 5.74 (mean ± SD) features were selected to predict IQ using manifold eccentricity of cortical regions at baseline, 6.20 ± 5.14 cortical features at baseline and maturational change, 5.45 ± 5.99 cortical and subcortical features at baseline, and 5.16 ± 5.43 at baseline and maturational change, suggesting that adding more independent variables may not per se lead to improvement in prediction accuracy.”as well as Materials and methods:“For each evaluation, a subset of features that could predict future IQ was identified using elastic net regularization (𝜌 = 0.5) with optimized regularization parameters (L1 and L2 penalty terms) via nested ten-fold cross-validation (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Parvandeh et al., 2020; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Varma and Simon, 2006; Zou and Hastie, 2005).

The prediction procedure was repeated 100 times with different training and test sets to reduce subject selection bias.”– Interpretability and Lack of ComparisonThe authors claim repeatedly that they are \"capitalizing on advanced manifold learning techniques\".One could imagine an infinite number of papers that take a dataset, use a technique to extract a metric, X (e.g., eccentricity), and then write about the changes in X with some property of interest, Y (e.g., age). Given this set of papers (and the non-independence between the set of possible Xs), the reader ought to be most interested in those Xs that provide the best performance and simplest interpretation, with other papers being redundant.Thus, a nuanced approach to presenting a paper like this is to demonstrate that the metric used represents an advance over alternative, simpler-to-compute, or clearer-to-interpret metrics that already exist.In this paper, however, the authors do not demonstrate the benefits of their particular choice of applying a specific nonlinear dimensionality reduction method using 3 dimensions alignment to a template manifold and then computing an eccentricity metric.We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, please see the points below. In brief, both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques compress high dimensional connectome data (n x n) into a series of lower-dimensional eigenvectors (i.e., gradients, each of the form n x 1), offering a synoptic view on connectome development. In our case, we used these manifold learning techniques to derive a three-dimensional connectivity space to which we were able to sensitively track developmental changes in adolescence. Beyond these methodological considerations, prior work has shown that principal gradients estimated from task-free functional (Margulies et al., 2016), microstructural (Paquola et al., 2019b), and diffusion MRI (Park et al., 2020a) broadly converge along an established model of sensory-fugal neural hierarchy and laminar differentiation (Mesulam, 1998), allowing the gradient mapping approach to align with theories of cortical organization and evolution (Buckner and Krienen, 2013; Goulas et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Sanides, 1969, 1962). We believe that the relative analytical simplicity and ability to contextualize work in classic theory represent an attractive justification for gradient mapping techniques. Below, we furthermore addressed the specific comments:For example:i. Is the nonlinearity required (e.g., does it outperform PCA or MDS)?Non-linear dimensionality techniques are theoretically appealing, as they can explain more information of the original data with the same number of components than linear techniques, which may boost performance on group classification, cluster identification, and phenotypic score prediction (Errity and McKenna, 2007; Gallos et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2020). Of note, diffusion map embedding is analytically straightforward, as it simply performs a singular value decomposition on the Markov matrix, which can be readily interpreted as a diffusion process throughout the connectome. Researchers have previously adopted both linear (Hong et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2019; Shine et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020) and non-linear techniques (Guell et al., 2018; Haak and Beckmann, 2020; Hong et al., 2019; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019b, 2019a; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020), and it thus remains an open question as to which technique should be preferred (Hong et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). We opted to stick with the diffusion maps in our main analysis to stay consistent with prior work from our group and others (Hong et al., 2019, 2020; Huntenburg et al., 2017; Larivière et al., 2020; Margulies et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2020; Paquola et al., 2019a; Park et al., 2021; Sofie L. Valk et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). In the revised sensitivity analyses, we also derived gradients via PCA, and showed consistent manifold dimensions using this technique (linear correlation = 0.998 ± 0.001 across E1/E2/E3; Figure 1—figure supplement 7A), as well as consistent age-effects on manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).We updated Results:“e) Connectome manifold generation using principal component analysis. In a separate analysis, we generated eigenvectors using principal component analysis (Wold et al., 1987), instead of diffusion map embedding (Coifman and Lafon, 2006), and found consistent spatial maps (linear correlation = 0.998 ± 0.001 across E1/E2/E3; Figure 1—figure supplement 7A) and longitudinal findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).”Materials and methods:“An affinity matrix was constructed with a normalized angle kernel, and eigenvectors were estimated via diffusion map embedding (Figure 1A), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (Coifman and Lafon, 2006) that projects connectome features into low dimensional manifolds (Margulies et al., 2016).

We compared the eigenvectors estimated from diffusion map embedding and principal component analysis using linear correlations.”as well as Discussion:“In our longitudinal study, we could identify marked connectome expansion during adolescence, mainly encompassing transmodal and heteromodal association cortex in prefrontal, temporal, and posterior regions, the territories known to mature later in development (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2006). Findings remained consistent when we considered a linear dimensionality reduction technique, suggesting robustness to methodological details of this analysis.”ii. Is there something special about picking 3 dimensions to do the eccentricity calculation? Is dimensionality reduction required at all (e.g., would you get similar results by computing eccentricity in the full-dimensional space?)Based on the screen plot in Figure 1A, we selected the first three eigenvectors as (i) they explained approximately 50% of variance in the affinity matrix, (ii) each explained >10% (i.e., 20.7/15.8/13.5% for E1/E2/E3, respectively), and (iii) the choice of three eigenvectors captured a clearly visible eigengap. Prior work has chosen a similar approach, as higher order components may sometimes not show clear spatial patterns and/or higher noise contributions (Haak et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2019, 2020; Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019b, 2019a; Park et al., 2021, 2020a; Vos de Wael et al., 2018). In response to the reviewers’ suggestion, we also assessed manifold eccentricity from the full dimensional space (Figure 1—figure supplement 9A-B). The spatial pattern of manifold eccentricity correlated with the original solution based on three eigenvectors (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Moreover, longitudinal changes in manifold eccentricity were similar to the original findings (linear correlation of t-statistic map = 0.68, p < 0.001; Figure 1—figure supplement 9C), confirming manifold expansion in transmodal cortices.We updated Results:“g) Manifold eccentricity based on all eigenvectors. Repeating manifold eccentricity calculation and age modeling using all eigenvectors, instead of using only the first three, we observed relatively consistent results with our original findings (linear correlation of manifold eccentricity r = 0.54, p < 0.001; t-statistic map r = 0.68, p < 0.001), also pointing to manifold expansion in transmodal cortices (Figure 1—figure supplement 9).”as well as Materials and methods:“g) Manifold eccentricity analysis based on all eigenvectors. We repeated our analysis by calculating manifold eccentricity from all eigenvectors to assess consistency of the findings (Figure 1—figure supplement 9).”iii. Does it outperform basic connectome measures (e.g., the simple ones the authors compute)?To compare the age-effects on manifold eccentricity with graph-theoretical effects, we calculated betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality measures (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). While betweenness centrality did not reveal significant effects, degree and eigenvector centrality showed effects in similar regions as manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Calculating linear correlation between the effect size maps, we found a graded pattern of similarity, which was low but significant for betweenness centrality (r = 0.18, p = 0.02; significance determined by 1,000 spin tests that account for spatial autocorrelation (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018)) and moderate for degree and eigenvector centrality (r = 0.57, p < 0.001; r = 0.47, p < 0.001).We updated Results:“f) Longitudinal changes in graph-theoretical measures. Repeating the longitudinal modeling using graph-theoretical centrality measures, we found significant age-related longitudinal changes in degree and eigenvector centrality, while betweenness centrality did not reveal significant effects, in similar regions to those that had significant age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Correlating the effect size maps for manifold eccentricity and each graph measure, we found a significant yet variable spatial similarity of the effect maps (betweenness centrality: r = 0.18, spin-test p = 0.02; degree centrality: r = 0.57, p < 0.001; eigenvector centrality: r = 0.47, p < 0.001).”as well as Materials and methods:“f) Longitudinal changes in graph-theoretical measures. To compare longitudinal changes in manifold eccentricity with those in graph-theoretical centrality measures, we calculated betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality of the structural connectomes and build similar linear mixed effects models to assess longitudinal change (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Betweenness centrality is the number of weighted shortest paths between any combinations of nodes that run through that node, degree centrality is the sum of edge weights connected to a given node, and eigenvector centrality measures the influence of a node in the whole network (Lohmann et al., 2010; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Zuo et al., 2012). Spatial similarity between t-statistics of centrality and manifold measures were assessed with 1,000 spin tests that account for spatial autocorrelation (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018).”There is a clear down-side of how opaque the approach is (and thus difficult to interpret relative to, say, connectivity degree), so one would hope for a correspondingly strong boost in performance. The authors could also do more to develop some intuition for the idea of a low-dimensional connection-pattern-similarity-space, and how to interpret taking Euclidean distances within such a space.CT=1N[∑i=1NT(E1)i,∑i=1NT(E2)i,∑i=1NT(E3)i]ME=∑e=13{I(Ee)−CT(e)}2Here, we used eigenvectors estimated from the decomposition technique to generate a new coordinate system in connectivity space (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018). Notably, in this manifold space, interconnected brain regions with similar connectivity patterns are closer together, while regions that do not have significant connectivity nor similarity in connectivity patterns are located farther apart. In our work, the specific space is a diffusion map, where Euclidean distances in the manifold correspond to diffusion times between the nodes of the network. To analyze how the multi-dimensional manifold structures change in the low dimensional manifold space, we simplified the multivariate eigenvectors into a single scalar value i.e., manifold eccentricity. Manifold eccentricity was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the manifold origin and all data points (i.e., brain regions) in manifold space. For example, using three eigenvectors, manifold eccentricity was defined as follows:CT is the template manifold origin; N number of brain regions; T(•) template manifold; ME manifold eccentricity; I(•) individual manifold; CT(e) origin of eth template manifold. This concept is visualized in Figure 1—figure supplement 15. Each brain region (i.e., each dot in the scatter plot) is described as a vector from the manifold origin (i.e., triangular mark in the scatter plot), and manifold eccentricity is simply a length (i.e., Euclidean distance) of that vector. Shifts in connectivity patterns of a given region thus will lead to shifts in the vectors, which in turn changes the manifold eccentricity. Thus, manifold eccentricity quantifies global brain organization in connectivity space.We updated Materials and methods:“Briefly, the eigenvectors estimated from the decomposition technique generate a connectivity coordinate system (Bijsterbosch et al., 2020; Haak et al., 2018; Huntenburg et al., 2018; Margulies et al., 2016; Mars et al., 2018) – the diffusion map, where […] Shifts in connectivity patterns of a given region thus will lead to shifts in the vectors, which in turn changes the manifold eccentricity. Thus, manifold eccentricity quantifies global brain organization based in the connectivity space.”– Developmental Enrichment AnalysisBoth in the main text and in the Materials and methods, this is described as \"genes were fed into a developmental enrichment analysis\". Can some explanation be provided as to what happens between the \"feeding in\" and what comes out? Without clearly described methods, it is impossible to interpret or critique this component of the paper. If the methodological details are opaque, then the significance of the results could be tested numerically relative to some randomized null inputs being 'fed in' to demonstrate specificity of the tested phenotype.We implemented developmental enrichment analysis using the cell-type specific expression analysis (CSEA) developmental expression tool (http://genetics.wustl.edu/jdlab/csea-tool-2) (Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014). This technique evaluates the significance of the overlap between the identified gene list and RNAseq data obtained from BrainSpan dataset (http://www.brainspan.org) across six brain regions (i.e., cortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala) and ten developmental periods (from early fetal to young adulthood) approximated from mouse data, yielding a total of 60 combinations of developmental enrichment profiles (Xu et al., 2014). The significance is calculated based on Fisher’s exact tests (Fisher, 1922) with FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).We updated Results:“We performed developmental gene set enrichment analysis using the cell-type specific expression analysis (CSEA) tool, which compares the selected gene list with developmental enrichment profiles (see Methods) (Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014). This analysis highlights developmental time windows across macroscopic brain regions in which genes are strongly expressed. We found marked expression of the genes enriched from childhood onwards in the cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum (FDR < 0.001; Figure 4B).”as well as Materials and methods:“Leveraging cell-type specific expression analysis (CSEA) developmental expression tool (http://genetics.wustl.edu/jdlab/csea-tool-2) (Dougherty et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014), we evaluated the significance of overlap between the genes showing consistent whole-brain expression pattern across donors (FDR < 0.05) with RNAseq data obtained from BrainSpan dataset (http://www.brainspan.org). The significance was calculated based on Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922) with FDR correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The CSEA tool provides simplified results of gene enrichment profiles along six major brain regions (i.e., cortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala) across ten developmental periods (from early fetal to young adulthood) approximated from mouse data, yielding a total of 60 combinations of developmental enrichment profiles (Xu et al., 2014).”As suggested, we additionally assessed spatial correlations between the post-mortem gene expression maps and rotated maps of the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (100 spherical, random rotations). For each iteration, the selected genes were used for developmental enrichment analysis using CSEA tool (Xu et al., 2014), and we obtained FDR-corrected p-values for each brain division and developmental period. We, thus, built a null distribution using the rotated p-values into which the actual p-value was placed. If the actual p-value did not belong to the 95% of the null distribution, it was deemed significant. The results remained consistent.We updated Materials and methods:“We repeated developmental enrichment analysis using the genes identified from the rotated maps of the age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (100 spherical rotations). For each iteration, we obtained developmental expression profiles using the identified genes, where the FDR-corrected p-values built a null distribution. For each brain division and developmental period, if the actual p-value placed outside 95% of the null distribution, it was deemed significant.”– IQ predictionThe predictions seem to be very poor (equality lines, y = x, should be drawn in Figure 5, to show what perfect predictions would look like; linear regressions are not helpful for a prediction task, and are deceptive of the appropriate MAE computation). The authors do not perform any comparisons in this section (even to a real baseline model like `predicted_IQ = mean(training_set_IQ)`). They also do not perform statistical tests (or quote p-values), but nevertheless make a range of claims, including of \"significant prediction\" or \"prediction accuracy was improved\", \"reemphasize the benefits of incorporating subcortical nodes\", etc. All of these claims should be tested relative to rigorous statistics, and comparisons to appropriate baseline/benchmark approaches.We thank the reviewer for the comment. To assess the significance of our prediction model, we compared the prediction performance to the suggested baseline model (i.e., predicted IQ = mean(training set IQ)). The prediction performance for the baseline model was not good showing a low negative correlation between actual and predicted IQ scores (r = -0.15 ± 0.06, MAE = 8.98 ± 0.04, p = 0.12). Our model based on cortical features (baseline: r = 0.14 ± 0.04, MAE = 8.93 ± 0.16, p = 0.09; baseline and maturational change: r = 0.18 ± 0.04, MAE = 9.10 ± 0.19, p = 0.04), and based on both cortical and subcortical features (baseline: r = 0.17 ± 0.03, MAE = 8.74 ± 0.11, p = 0.04; baseline and maturational change: r = 0.21 ± 0.02, MAE = 8.86 ± 0.14, p = 0.01) outperformed the baseline model (Meng’s z-test p < 0.001 for all cases) (Meng et al., 1992). The results suggest that while manifold features are only weakly related to IQ, they still provide information on future IQ above and beyond the baseline model.We updated the Results:“We compared the prediction performance of our model with a baseline model, where IQ of the test set was simple average of training set (r = -0.15 ± 0.06, MAE = 8.98 ± 0.04, p = 0.12; see Methods). We found that our model outperformed this baseline model (Meng’s z-test p < 0.001) (Meng et al., 1992).”Materials and methods:“To assess whether our model outperforms baseline model, we predicted IQ of test data using average of IQ of training data (i.e., predicted IQ = mean(training set IQ)). The improvement of prediction performance was assessed using Meng’s z-test (Meng et al., 1992).”as well as Discussion:“Of note, although our model significantly outperformed a baseline model, the relationship between the actual and predicted IQ scores did not locate on the equality line and the strength of the association was rather weak. Further improvements in brain-based IQ prediction in adolescence, for example through combinations of structural and functional imaging features, will be a focus of future work.”We additionally performed the prediction analysis using a regression tree method (i.e., decision tree learning), a non-linear approach based on tree model constituting root node and split leaf nodes, where the leaf nodes contain the response variables (Breiman et al., 1984). However, the prediction results were not improved compared to linear model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).We updated Results:“l) IQ prediction using non-linear model. We predicted IQ at follow-up using a regression tree method (Breiman et al., 1984), instead of linear regression model, but we could not find improved prediction performance (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”as well as Materials and methods:“l) IQ prediction using non-linear model. We additionally performed prediction analysis for predicting future IQ score using regression tree method (i.e., decision tree learning), a non-linear approach based on tree model constituting root node and split leaf nodes, where the leaf nodes contain the response variables (Breiman et al., 1984) (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”– Group ConnectomeGiven how much the paper relies on estimating a group structural connectome, it should be visualized and characterized. For example, a basic analysis of the distribution of edge weights and degree, especially as edge weights can vary over orders of magnitude and high weights (more likely to be short distances) may therefore unduly dominate some of the low-dimensional components). The authors may also consider testing robustness performed to alternative ways of estimating the connectome [e.g., Oldham et al. NeuroImage 222, 117252 (2020)] and its group-level summary [e.g., Roberts et al. NeuroImage 145, 1-42 (2016)].We thank the Reviewers for these suggestions. We calculated structural connectome in individual level, and estimated group representative connectome using a distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019), which is visualized in Figure 1A. As suggested, we performed the longitudinal modeling using the connectome edge weights and found significant increases in weights within frontoparietal and default mode networks, as well as attention and sensory networks (FDR < 0.05; Figure 1—figure supplement 12). These results are consistent with our main findings based on manifold eccentricity that pointed to mainly transmodal effects.We updated Results:“j) Longitudinal modeling using edge weights. Repeating the longitudinal modeling across age using connectome edge weights, we found significant increases in edge weights within frontoparietal and default mode networks, as well as in attention and sensory networks (FDR < 0.05; Figure 1—figure supplement 12), consistent with findings based on manifold eccentricity.”as well as Materials and methods:“j) Longitudinal modeling using edge weights. In addition to the analyses based on manifold eccentricity, linear mixed effect modeling using connectome edge weights assessed age-related longitudinal changes in streamline strength (Figure 1—figure supplement 12).”To assess robustness of group representative structural connectomes, we built the connectomes with two different approaches: (i) Distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019) was adopted for the main analysis, and (ii) consistency thresholding was assessed in a supplementary analysis. Consistency thresholding approach averages subject specific matrices, in addition to performing a 50, 40, 30, 20, 10% thresholding, as well as simple averaging (i.e., 0% thresholding) (Wang et al., 2019) (Figure 1—figure supplement 10). We calculated linear correlations between spatial maps of eigenvectors derived from distance-dependent thresholding and the group consistency method and found high similarity (r = 0.89 ± 0.01 for E1; 0.93 ± 0.004 for E2; 0.85 ± 0.01 for E3 across consistency thresholds).We updated Results:“h) Robustness of group representative structural connectome. We compared gradients derived from the group representative structural connectome, based on (i) distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019) and (ii) consistency thresholding (Wang et al., 2019) (Figure 1—figure supplement 10). We found high similarity in spatial maps of the estimated manifolds (r = 0.89 ± 0.01 for E1; 0.93 ± 0.004 for E2; 0.85 ± 0.01 for E3 across six different thresholds), indicating robustness.”as well as Materials and methods:“h) Robustness of group representative structural connectome. We compared the distance-dependent thresholding (Betzel et al., 2019) that was adopted for the main analysis with a consistency thresholding approach (Wang et al., 2019). The latter averages subject specific matrices, in addition to performing a 50, 40, 30, 20, 10% thresholding, as well as simple averaging (i.e., 0% thresholding) (Figure 1—figure supplement 10).”– Individual AlignmentThe paper relies on individuals being successfully aligned to the template manifold. Accordingly, some analysis should be performed quantifying how well individuals could be mapped. Presumably some subjects fit very well onto the template, whereas others do not. Is there something interesting about the poorly aligned subjects? Do your results improve when excluding them?Individual manifolds were aligned to template manifold with Procrustes alignment, which makes eigenvectors from different individuals more comparable e.g., by flipping eigenvector signs (Langs et al., 2015; Vos de Wael et al., 2020). To evaluate the procedure, we calculated linear correlations between template and individual manifolds before/after alignment. We found significant improvement in correlations after aligning individual manifolds to the template (0.92±0.03/0.93±0.03/0.94±0.03 after alignment; -0.02±0.03/-0.001±0.37/0.003±0.12 before alignment for E1/E2/E3).As suggested, we also performed the longitudinal modeling after excluding 10% of subjects with poor alignment (cutoff r = 0.83; the new set had a linear correlation with template manifold of mean ± SD r = 0.94 ± 0.01). We still could find consistent results (Figure 1—figure supplement 6), where the t-statistics showed strong correlation with those derived using the whole subjects (r = 0.97, p < 0.001), suggesting robustness.We updated Results:“d) Gradient alignment fidelity. When calculating linear correlations between template and individual manifolds before and after alignment, we found significant increases after alignment (r = 0.92±0.03/0.93±0.03/0.94±0.03) compared to before alignment (-0.02±0.03/-0.001±0.37/0.003±0.12), for E1/E2/E3, respectively, supporting effectiveness of alignment. After excluding 10% of subjects with poor alignment (cutoff r = 0.83; the new set was correlated with the template manifold, r = 0.94 ± 0.01), we found consistent age-related changes in manifold eccentricity (Figure 1—figure supplement 6), with the t-statistic map showing strong correlation to the map derived in the whole sample (r = 0.97, p < 0.001).”as well as Materials and methods:“d) Gradient alignment fidelity. To assess robustness of individual alignment, we computed linear correlations between the template and individual manifolds before and after alignment. We also repeated the linear mixed effect modeling after excluding 10% of subjects with the lowest alignment to the template manifold (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).”"

We explored inter-correlations between the measures and used intraclass correlation coefficients to evaluate the agreement between clinician-, parent- and child ratings of the same constructs.ResultsRatings on symptom-specific measures varied largely between participants. Agreement between informants was excellent on functional scales, fair-to-moderate on global severity scales and mixed on symptom-specific scales. Clinician-rated global and functional measures had stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than with symptom-specific measures.ConclusionsGeneral instruments assessing global severity and functioning are well suited for the assessment and follow-up of PANS, but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of core symptoms.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12888-021-03450-5.KeywordsPANSPANDASOCDTouretteImmunopsychiatryKarolinska Instituteissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2021IntroductionPediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a descriptive entity consisting of acute-onset OCD and/or eating disorder accompanied by a wide range of secondary psychiatric and somatic symptoms [1]. Initial and recurring symptoms may be severe and lead to significant loss of function [2, 3]. There are no clearly established evidence-based treatments for PANS [4] but the long-term prognosis is generally positive, with approximately two thirds of patients presenting with minimal or no symptoms 2–5 years after initial presentation [5]. However, approximately one third of patients have a chronic clinical course and require additional treatment [5].Several measures have been proposed for the characterization of PANS patients [6–8]. The wide range of symptoms represented within the PANS construct constitutes a challenge for both daily clinic work and for the design of clinical trials [4]. At least two clinician-rated instruments or symptom checklists have been specifically developed for PANS, but their administration is time-consuming, their items cannot be easily collated to calculate total scores, and their psychometric properties have not been established [9, 10]. The use of gold standard measures for specific psychiatric symptoms, such as the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) [11] or the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) [12, 13] as single outcome measures is also problematic because they only capture specific symptom clusters and their use may result in both an over- or underestimation of treatment responders [4, 14]. Conversely, trying to assess every individual symptom cluster may result in an overwhelming number of rating scales for the families to complete, reducing the quality of the collected data and the willingness to participate in research.Previous experience from our PANS cohort [3, 5] suggested a potential discrepancy between clinician-rated measures of global functioning, disease severity and improvement scales on the one hand, and subjective reports from parents on the other. It is possible that frequently used instruments may not capture the full extent of the patients’ difficulties [5]. For some families this may result in frustration and a perceived lack of understanding of the true impact of PANS from the medical community.In this study, we aimed to investigate the suitability of standard clinical measures for the assessment and follow-up of children with PANS, and formally assess the degree of agreement between multiple informants (child, parent and clinician ratings). Ultimately, we aim to shed some light on the optimal ways to measure the complex presentation of this patient group.MethodsParticipantsParticipants were consecutive referrals to a multidisciplinary immunopsychiatry outpatient clinic in Stockholm, Sweden, who were previously included in a Swedish PANS cohort [3, 5]. Cohort members who had a minimum of 2 years since inclusion were eligible for participation in a follow-up study, regardless of whether they were still active patients in the clinic or not. The current analyses are based on data collected as part of the follow-up study, i.e. 2–5 years after first assessment [5]. All participants met strict PANS criteria at first assessment.Parents/guardians of the participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm (reference number EPN 2015/1977–31/4 (2019–02132)). All procedures performed in the study were in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.Clinical evaluationsA child and adolescent psychiatrist conducted a 2-h face-to-face assessment, including a standardized patient- and parent interview and clinician-rated measures of symptoms and general functioning. Child- and parent-rated measures of specific symptoms and general functioning were completed prior to the visit to the clinic. Some of the participating children were very young, but parents were instructed to help their children as little as possible when compiling their responses. In the few cases where an item on a scale was missing, these were completed via a telephone call with the parent. If a child-rated item was missing, the parent was instructed to report the missing item in collaboration with the child.The specific measures were chosen based on our clinical experience and recommendations from the 2013 PANS Consensus Conference [7], and can be classified as measures of global symptom severity and adaptive functioning, and symptom-specific measures.Measures of global symptom severity and adaptive functioningThe Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated scale measuring the current severity of a patients psychiatric illness in general, on a 7 point single-item scale [15]. CGI-S scores range from ‘normal’ (score 1) to ‘extremely ill’ (score 7). It is a widely used, validated clinical outcome measure in psychiatry [16]. In addition to the original clinician-rated version, the CGI-S was adapted for its use as a self-report measure, resulting in parent- and child-rated versions of the scale (see Supplemental material).The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire – Parent−/Self-rated version (SDQ-P/S) is a validated parent- and child-rated, behavioral screening questionnaire consisting of five subscales, four measuring difficulties (hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, conduct problems and peer problems) and one measuring strengths (pro-social behavior). Items are scored from ‘not true’ (score 0) to ‘certainly true’ (score 2), with a maximum total difficulty score of 40. A higher total difficulty score indicates a higher symptom burden and a lower global functioning. A total difficulty score of 14 has been suggested as a cut-off. SDQ-S is adapted for 11–16 year old children and adolescents and was therefore only used for this age group in the study [17, 18].The Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) is a clinician-rated, extensively validated, single-item measure of general functioning. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher (better) level of general functioning [19]. The assessment should be made by a specifically trained child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist after a thorough clinical assessment and reflect the most impaired level during a specified time period of 1 month, regardless of treatment and/or prognosis [20, 21].KIDSCREEN-10 – Parent/Youth version is a parent- and child-rated screening instrument measuring well-being and health-related quality of life for children and adolescents. The scale contains 10 items, using a 5-point response scale, with a maximum score of 50. A higher score indicates higher (better) health-related quality of life. An additional item measuring general well-being is scored separately, using a 5-point scale, from ‘bad’ (score 1) to ‘excellent’ (score 5) [22, 23].The Work and Social Adjustment scale- Parent/Youth version (WSAS-P/Y) is a brief and reliable parent- and child-rated measure of educational, work and social adjustment in children and adolescents. The scale includes five items related to everyday activities (school and employment, everyday activities, social activities, leisure time, and family/relationships), scored from ‘not impaired at all’ (score 0) to ‘severely impaired’ (score 8), with a maximum score of 40. WSAS-P/Y has high internal consistency and is sensitive to change [24, 25].Symptom-specific measuresThe Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) are clinician-rated instruments to quantify the severity of OCD and tic disorder symptoms, respectively [11–13]. Both scales have excellent psychometric properties and are routinely employed in clinical practice and clinical trials. Higher total scores indicate a higher symptom burden, and clinically significant levels of OCD and tic symptoms are generally considered to be reached at CY-BOCS > 15 and YGTSS > 30 [12, 26, 27].The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Child Version (OCI-CV) is a 21-item child-rated self-report measure of OCD symptom severity that correlates moderately well with clinician-rated measures of OCD symptoms. It consists of seven sub-scales (doubting/checking, obsessing, hoarding, washing, ordering and neutralizing). Items are scored from ‘never’ (score 0) to ‘always’ (score 2), with a maximum score of 42. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms [28, 29].The Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire – Parent/Child version (SMFQ-P/C) is a 13-item parent- and child-rated screening tool for depression in children and adolescents, developed from the longer 34-item version Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Both versions of the scale have been extensively validated in community and clinical samples. Responses are rated using a 3-point scale from ‘not true’ (score 0) to ‘true’ (score 2), with a maximum score of 26. A higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms. Suggested cut-offs for girls are > 16 and for boys > 5 when parent- or self-rated [30, 31].The Separation Anxiety Avoidance Inventory – Parent/Child version (SAAI-P/C) is a validated 12-item parent- and child-rated measure of avoidance behavior in separation situations. Each item is scored from ‘never’ (score 0) to ‘always’ (score 4), with a maximum score of 48. A higher total score indicates more severe avoidance behavior [32].The Insomnia Severity Index – Child and adolescent version (ISI-C) is a 7-item child-rated measure assessing insomnia severity using a 5-point scale from ‘not at all’ (score 0) to ‘extremely’ (score 4), with a maximum score of 28. A high total score indicates greater insomnia severity, with scores 15 and above indicating clinical insomnia [33, 34].The Autism Spectrum Quotient Child/Adolescent version-10 (AQ-10) is a 10-item parent-rated instrument initially developed as a tool to aid referral decision making for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluation. The maximum score is 10 and scores 6 or above are considered a positive indication of ASD [35]. Previous data has shown a high incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PANS-patients during follow-up, highlighting the importance of using an ASD screening tool even for previously assessed patients [5].The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham scale (SNAP-IV) is a parent-rated scale assessing attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD)-related symptoms and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) [36, 37]. It is a frequently used tool in treatment studies as well as in daily clinic work following-up ADHD treatment. The SNAP-IV exists in different versions depending on items rated. The version most frequently used in Sweden is a 30-item version rating ADHD inattention, ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity and ODD. Each item is scored from ‘not at all’ (score 0) to ‘very much’ (score 4), with a maximum total score of 120. Mean scores for each sub-section of the scale are also calculated [38].The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) is a 36-item parent-rated scale of disruptive behavior problems in children, divided in an intensity scale measuring the frequency of a behavior and a problem scale measuring if the parent perceives the behavior as a problem. The maximum score on the intensity scale is 252, and scores > 130 are considered clinically significant. The maximum score on the problem scale is 36, with scores > 14 indicating significant parental distress [39, 40].Statistical analysisFor each scale and subscale, we calculated descriptive statistics (median, mean and SD). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to establish the degree of agreement between clinician-, parent- and child ratings of the same rating scale. Because the set of raters was different for each target (i.e. same clinician but different set of parent and child rating each patient), ICC (1,k) estimates and their 95% confident intervals were calculated based on a mean-rating by k number of raters (k = 3 if clinician, parent and child; k = 2 if clinician and parent, clinician and child or parent and child), absolute-agreement, one-way random effects model [41]. Individual ICCs (the agreement between different raters on the same individual/participant) are reported. ICC values < 0.40 correspond to poor agreement, values between 0.40 and 0.59 to fair agreement, values between 0.60 and 0.74 to good agreement, and values > 0.75 to excellent agreement [42]. Correlation coefficients were calculated in order to measure the degree of association between measures. Because the data were not always normally distributed, Spearman rank correlation was used. Correlation coefficients between 0 and 0.29 represent poor association, 0.30–0.49 fair association, 0.50–0.79 moderate association and > 0.80 a very strong association [43, 44].All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA software (version STATA/IC15.1 for Mac, StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA). P-values below 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.ResultsSample characteristicsThirty-four out of 46 eligible PANS patients consented to participate in the follow-up study and provided data. Median age at follow-up was 11.5 years (range 6.7–17.1) and 19 (56%) of the participants were male. Further details on the clinical characteristics of the cohort, including duration of illness, comorbidities, current symptoms, family history of psychiatric and autoimmune disease can be found in a previous publication [5].Descriptive statisticsAt a group level, median and mean scores for most global and specific symptom scales generally indicated low-to-moderate symptom severity and high level of functioning. However, there was substantial variability in the data, suggesting that some individuals experienced impaired symptoms at follow-up. Descriptive statistics for each of the measures are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Thus, the overall agreement between CGI-S ratings made by clinician, parent and child was only fair.Regarding the SDQ-P/S for participants > 11 years (n = 22), the ICC (1,2) of parent and child ratings was 0.64 (95% CI 0.31–0.83), representing a moderately good agreement.The ICC (1,2) of parent and child ratings of the KIDSCREEN-10 was 0.81 (95% CI 0.65–0.90) and of parent and child ratings of the WSAS-P/Y 0.82 (95% CI 0.66–0.91), both representing excellent agreements.The ICC (1,2) of SMFQ-P/C ratings made by parent and child was 0.46 (95% CI 0.14–0.70), only representing a fair agreement. In contrast, the ICC (1,2) of SAAI-P/C ratings was 0.88 (95% CI 0.77–0.94), representing an excellent agreement.Correlations between measuresInter-correlations between clinician-rated CGAS and both parent-rated SDQ-P and child-rated SDQ-S were poor, including subscales. There was a fair association between clinician-rated CGI-S and parent-rated total SDQ (ρ = 0.448, p < 0.008), but not at a subscale level. The parent-rated functional scales KIDSCREEN-10 and WSAS-P had stronger inter-correlations than did the general symptom-severity scale SDQ-P with clinician-rated global symptom and functional scales. There was a moderate-to-strong association between parent-rated KIDSCREEN-10 and clinician-rated CGI-S (ρ = − 0.663, p < 0.001) and a very strong association between WSAS-P and clinician-rated CGI-S (ρ = 0.811, p < 0.001). The same was true for the child-rated versions of the functional scales. See Tables 3 and 4 (subscales available in Tables S1 and S2).

We examined the correspondence between clinician, parent and child measures of global symptom severity, adaptive functioning and specific psychiatric symptoms. This is critical because it is still unclear how to best measure the complex symptom presentation of the syndrome. Using the appropriate outcome measures has important implications for both clinical practice and the design of clinical trials.Overall, median ratings for measures assessing global symptom severity and adaptive functioning indicated low symptom burden and a rather high level of everyday functioning in our sample. However, there was a large variability in the data, particularly in the symptom-specific measures, reflecting the heterogeneity of symptom presentations and clinical courses that are characteristic of the syndrome. These findings confirm and extend the findings of our previous study on the same cohort [5]. Specifically, we had previously reported that approximately one third of participants in the follow-up study had clinically significant symptoms and required additional treatment.CGI-S is a gold standard measure of psychiatric illness severity, most frequently assessed by the clinician. The modest agreement between CGI-S ratings across informants in our sample suggests that it may be helpful complementing the clinician rating with ratings made by the parent and child. Overall, agreement between ratings made by parent and child were excellent for functional scales, but only fair-to-moderate for global symptom severity and symptom-specific scales, with the exception of the separation anxiety measure, which had excellent agreement between informants.As expected, because of the previously mentioned heterogeneity of symptom presentations, global clinician-rated symptom and functional measures tended to have stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than with symptom-specific ones.Parent- and child-rated functional scales KIDSCREEN-10 and WSAS-P/Y correlated well with clinician-rated global symptom and functional scales, and the agreements between ratings made by parent and child were excellent. Despite both scales being useful in the study, KIDSCREEN-10 may be more easily accessible to a younger patient group. Multiple parents commented on the suitability of the WSAS-P/Y, and indicated that its items may be less suitable for the younger patients. By contrast, the KIDSCREEN-10 was perceived as simple and straightforward for both younger children and teenagers.Somewhat surprisingly, SDQ-P/S seemed to have weak inter-correlations with global symptom and functional scales and the agreement between informants was only moderate. This may be due to SDQ-P/S being more symptom-oriented than the other global measures used in the study. Results suggest that it may be less clinically useful in this particular patient group, but it should also be noted that the SDQ impact supplement was not used and therefore is not included in our analyses.Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are part of main PANS criteria but were surprisingly rare in our sample at follow-up. Assessing obsessive-compulsive symptoms with a self-rated scale as a complement to CY-BOCS may not add a lot of information within the PANS patient group at follow-up. At onset, OCD is generally a more pervasive part of the symptom presentation, and more time should be devoted to a comprehensive OCD assessment.We did not include a measure specifically measuring eating disorder symptoms because, in our clinical experience, these tend to be OCD-related and without the defining features of a typical eating disorder such as fears of gaining weight (resembling avoidant/restrictive food avoidance disorder). For selected patients with eating difficulties, it may be useful to measure these symptoms in order to track their improvement.The agreement between SMFQ-P/C ratings made by parent and child was only fair, indicating the importance of having both parent- and child ratings of depression and thus avoid underestimating these symptoms in PANS patients. Conversely, the agreement between SAAI-P/C ratings made by parent and patient was excellent, suggesting that either parent or child ratings may suffice for clinical purposes.Previous longitudinal data have shown a high comorbidity with neuropsychiatric disorders, combined with intensification of related symptoms during PANS flares [5, 45]. We therefore recommend measures that can screen for, and assess the severity of, autistic behaviors, inattention, hyperactivity and conduct problems when following up PANS. In our sample ECBI had a very strong association to SNAP-IV, suggesting that the simpler SNAP-IV may sufficiently cover the patients’ oppositional behaviors for clinical purposes. When detecting potentially severe oppositional defiant behaviors, ECBI can be used as a complement.Our study has some limitations. First, we analyzed data from a small sample of patients from a single clinic. Second, the age range was such that the results of the child-rated measures should be interpreted with caution; despite our efforts, it is possible that the younger children received help from their parents to fill in their questionnaires. Third, we were not able to calculate internal consistency of the scales included in this study (only total scores were available). We could thus not examine the psychometric properties of the scales in this particular sample. Future studies would benefit from conducting such psychometric analyses.SummaryClinical experience and the results from our follow-up study suggest that it is important to include clinician-, parent- and child ratings in the assessment of PANS, as a single perspective is unlikely to capture the full complexity of the syndrome. Brief, general measures assessing global disease severity and adaptive functioning, are clinically helpful and should be used but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of the core symptoms in PANS, such as OCD, anxiety, depression and behavioral problems. However, their exclusive use is problematic as the natural course of the syndrome is such that some patients may not have specific symptoms to rate at follow-up. Furthermore, it is important that the assessment is straightforward and as brief as possible. Based on our experience, we recommend the use of a core battery of clinician-, parent- and child-rated measures in both clinical practice and in clinical trials (Table 7). The proposed core battery of measures will provide a broad evaluation of PANS-related symptoms, but can be complemented with further symptom-specific measures when needed.

These interactions play important roles in health from supporting neural development, homeostasis and plasticity to modifying behaviour. Neuroimmunology is increasingly recognised as a field with the potential to deliver a significant positive impact on human health and treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, translation to the clinic is hindered by fundamental knowledge gaps on the underlying mechanisms of action or the optimal timing of an intervention, and a lack of appropriate tools to visualise and modulate both systems. Here we propose ten key disease-agnostic research questions that, if addressed, could lead to significant progress within neuroimmunology in the short to medium term. We also discuss four cross-cutting themes to be considered when addressing each question: i) bi-directionality of neuroimmune interactions; ii) the biological context in which the questions are addressed (e.g. health vs disease vs across the lifespan); iii) tools and technologies required to fully answer the questions; and iv) translation into the clinic. We acknowledge that these ten questions cannot represent the full breadth of gaps in our understanding; rather they focus on areas which, if addressed, may have the most broad and immediate impacts. By defining these neuroimmunology priorities, we hope to unite existing and future research teams, who can make meaningful progress through a collaborative and cross-disciplinary effort.Peripheral nervous systemcentral nervous systempsychoneuroimmunologyimmunopsychiatrybehaviourmental healthinflammationneuroimmune interactionsWellcome StaffNo funding directly supported this work.

Neuroimmunology represents a rapidly expanding area of research with a high potential to improve human health, catalysed by increasing evidence implicating the immune system in neurological and psychiatric development and disorders and, conversely, the role of the nervous system in modifying immune function. These interactions are dynamic and diverse, ranging from health and homeostasis, across the lifespan, from development to old age and during disease. Closing the gap in our knowledge will increase our fundamental understanding of communication between two complex systems and how neuroimmune interactions change over time, how they influence our behaviour and what happens in neurological and psychiatric disorders.Progress towards realising the translational potential of neuroimmunology has, at times, been hindered by gaps in basic mechanistic understanding and limited tools to monitor, measure and modulate cells and molecules of the central nervous system (CNS). Better understanding of the multiple interactions between cell types of the nervous and immune systems is required, both within the CNS and the periphery. Furthermore, the role of cells at the interface of the two systems, such as border-associated macrophages and immune cells that reside or circulate within and beyond the CNS, is becoming increasingly appreciated. This highlights the importance of understanding dynamic neuroimmune interactions in the broadest sense. It is important to consider when and where these interactions are biologically advantageous or dysfunctional. For example, microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages and most abundant immunological cell type in the CNS, play a vital role in supporting healthy nervous system development and homeostasis; however, they can also contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction/degeneration, depending on the context

3, providing an example of how multiple interactions between cell types in the CNS are critical for health and homeostasis.While it has long been known that microbial infections can affect the nervous system through interactions with the immune system
4, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted how environmental influences can have an impact on neuroimmune interactions. In particular, it has been shown that a psychiatric diagnosis could be an independent risk factor for COVID-19, but equally that survivors of COVID-19 are at increased risk of a subsequent psychiatric or neurological diagnosis
5. As we begin to understand the neurological and psychiatric symptoms of long COVID, there has been increased interest in neuroimmune interactions and immune-to-brain communication, and how their homeostatic balance is affected by infection

7.Identifying the research priorities in neuroimmunologySetting research priorities requires bringing together the relevant stakeholders to collectively determine which ‘uncertainties’ in a field are the most pressing issues to resolve through research. Identifying the key scientific questions can help a community galvanise around a common set of goals and facilitate the formation of new collaborations.To accomplish this, and building off of earlier discussions
8, in October 2020, Wellcome brought together some of the leading neuroimmunology researchers in the UK, from across a range of institutions, career stages and clinical and scientific backgrounds. Members of the steering committee can be found in
Table 1. The goal was to identify questions that, if addressed, would deliver a step change in our understanding in the short and medium term (five to 10 years) and, in turn, have a positive impact on human health. It was important that these questions were generated by the research community, with the greatest potential to maximise basic understanding and therapeutic advances, without being influenced by other factors or strategies. The aim was to focus on the key questions that would have the broadest and most immediate impact, and that would be comprehensive and inclusive for the whole neuroimmunology community while still providing meaningful and tangible scientific direction.Table 1.

Broad definitions of the nervous and immune systems were maintained. The nervous system would include: neuronal synapses and surrounding glia, specific brain, spinal cord or retinal compartments, the peripheral nervous system and the cerebrospinal fluid. The immune system would include both the peripheral and CNS-resident innate and adaptive immune systems, and those at the interface with the nervous system, including cells associated with the blood brain barrier. In addition, it was considered important to be inclusive in language and terminology, whilst being able to communicate across diverse fields. Throughout, we refer to neuroimmunology as encompassing the full range of the two systems, from molecular and cellular interactions, through to immunopsychiatry and psychoneuroimmunology, thus inclusive of mind, brain and environment interactions.A conscious decision was made to be disease-agnostic when setting the research questions, while recognising the importance of the clinical context, as discussed in detail later. As such, persons with lived experience were not included at this stage of the process, although we recognise their future participation is essential when setting priorities for specific conditions.Research priorities in neuroimmunologyBy engaging with a broad spectrum of stakeholders in an open and transparent process, the following research priorities were identified collectively (
Figure 1).Figure 1. Research priorities in neuroimmunology.Ten key research questions were identified which, if addressed, would drive the field forward in the short to medium term and translate to a positive impact on human health. The ten questions can broadly be grouped into three categories reflecting the scale of analysis (e.g. molecules, circuits) and internal and external factors that influence, or are influenced by, neuroimmune interactions. Each of these questions will need to be addressed in the relevant contexts including across the lifespan and in health and disease, and may require the development or adoption of new tools and technologies to be successful. Addressing these questions will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base and ultimately drive translation (e.g. through identification of new targets, biomarkers).Aiming to keep the research priorities broad and applicable to the diverse researchers in the field, four cross-cutting themes were discussed that provide additional context to each question: bi-directional communication, context, translation and tool/technology development.Bidirectional relationship of immune and nervous systems interactionsInteractions between the immune and nervous systems are bidirectional and both the neuroimmune and immune-neuro perspectives should be considered when addressing the research questions.For example, in the immune-to-neuro direction, the presence of immune cells in the CNS was once considered a sign of neuropathology, but it is now increasingly recognised that immune signalling in the CNS is important for normal development and healthy brain function. The formation of mature neural circuits for example requires pruning of synapses by the immune system, including the classical complement pathway (initiated by C1q)
9, microglia
10 and MHC Class I
11. By extension, inappropriate activation of the immune system can lead to excessive synapse loss and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s Disease
12. This fine balance of immune function in the CNS is further demonstrated by the ability of antigen-specific T cells to improve neuronal survival after a CNS injury
13.In pathological states, such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and autoantibody-mediated neurological conditions, immune function is unequivocally involved in neuroinflammatory damage and/or pain but, paradoxically, can also support tissue regeneration (e.g. remyelination). Inflammation can also play a role in other states and conditions, such as stress resilience and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Immune-deficient mice (severe combined immunodeficiency and nude mice) were more likely to develop PTSD than wildtype mice when subjected to stress, with improvements seen in the stress response upon transfer of T cells from wildtype donors
13. Further roles are also proposed for T cells in learning memory and behaviour, in both antigen-specific and antigen-independent manners
13.When considering areas to prioritise, it was noted that strategies modulating the immune system to improve neurological or behavioural function are more developed than vice versa. As such, these are perhaps more likely to be taken forward in the medium term for a variety of reasons, e.g. due to challenges in developing brain penetrant drugs. However, we fully acknowledge the importance of psychological, behavioural and physical interventions that act via the nervous system to modulate immune function and their potential to be harnessed for therapeutic benefit. It has been recognised that the modulation of neural function plays a role in regulating immune responses, for example as seen in the gut-brain axis as well as strategies to modulate neurotransmitters or neuropeptides to influence health
14,
15. The immune system is also susceptible to behavioural conditioning whereby pairing of a novel aversive taste stimulus (conditioned stimulus) with an immunosuppressive drug e.g. cyclosporin (unconditioned stimulus) results in the taste stimulus itself exerting immunosuppressive properties
16,
17. Proof-of-principle data suggest that a similar behavioural conditioning approach may support an immunosuppressive drug dose-reduction strategy in renal transplant patients
18.Activation of both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated to affect the immune system both directly and indirectly. For example, lymphocytes express surface receptors for neurohormones and transmitters and are exposed to neurochemicals in lymphoid organs including the spleen and in peripheral blood. Indeed, directly activating dopaminergic neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area and characterizing the subsequent immune response after exposure to
Escherichia coli has shown an increase in both innate and adaptive immune responses
19. This was indexed by enhanced antibacterial activity of monocytes and macrophages, reduced bacterial load and a heightened T cell response in a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity
19.Thus, studying both neuroimmune and immune-neuro interactions will be critical to providing a holistic mechanistic understanding of these pathways that will ultimately form the foundations for innovative interventions. Furthermore, these established CNS-immune communication pathways demonstrate the potential of psychological/psycho-social interventions to improve immune health and the importance of thinking more broadly, i.e. beyond pharmacological modulators, about how neuroimmunology could inform strategies to support health.The importance of contextUnderstanding the context of neuroimmune cross-talk is critical when considering the underlying mechanisms. When tackling these priorities, research teams should carefully consider and report the rationale behind the chosen experimental context(s). For example, localisation (e.g. a specific brain region or peripheral nerve terminal), age or developmental stage, and/or health or disease setting, including relapse and remission. The context itself could define which research questions are a priority to address first, or which cell types to investigate and how. For example, studying a particular cell type might be most appropriate within a specific disease setting or developmental stage.Investigating neuroimmune relationships during homeostasis and development from pregnancy and early life through to ageing will provide significant mechanistic insights into the interactions. While the intent of the discussion was to be broadly disease-agnostic, defining where and how disease is included in the investigations was recognised to be important. The disease context has the potential to provide fundamental insights for certain common phenotypes across multiple diseases, both with relevance to aetiology of disease onset, persistence and progression. For example, insight into brain development can give significant clues into mechanisms that can be reactivated in disease (for example synaptic elimination). Indeed, neuroinflammation is beneficial in the right context and so improving our understanding of when it switches from being beneficial (e.g. instructing developmental processes, removing debris, fighting infection, promoting regeneration) to detrimental (e.g. potential maladaptive synaptic pruning, failure to sense danger, uncontrolled inflammation) to neurological health, is required. Failure to consider different contexts could lead to the unintended exclusion of important areas and overlooking of key mechanisms, for instance natural changes in neuroimmune cross-talk during critical periods of development and ageing.Contextual elements that should be considered include the effect of genetic background, risk factors and co-morbidities (e.g. metabolic disorders and obesity, or chronic low-grade infection and changes in the microbiome), all of which can lead to chronic inflammation and an impact on the nervous system, and predate disorders such as psychosis or depression
20. The influence of sleep and changes in neuroendocrine signalling (including glucocorticoids, androgens, oestrogens, neuropeptides and other hormones) and the impact of therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions (such as chemotherapy, immunomodulation or analgesics) are also important considerations. The impact of diversity on neuroimmune interactions, including sex and ethnicity, will also be important in gaining real understanding of the nuances of these interactions. Secondary influences, such as environmental factors, pollution, exercise, epidemics, therapeutics, poverty or stress, are increasingly recognised as playing important roles in shaping these interactions. As well as encouraging new epidemiological studies, the impact of societal factors opens the way for new collaborations with experts in the social sciences, further breaking down traditional academic siloes. While the impact of acute and chronic infection was not addressed directly when developing the priorities, infection and neuroimmune interactions are inherently linked e.g. in the maternal-immune activation model, where prenatal exposure to infection could be a driver in initiating depression or psychosis in later life, or chronic gum disease as a driver of dementia
21.In summary, whilst reductionist and mechanistic experimental studies are pivotal, the impact of neuroimmune interactions cannot be studied in isolation, and the broader context of these interactions, be it co-morbidities, age, chronic stress or infection, need to be taken into consideration (and reported) when trying to understand the roles and functions of these interactions over time. This can add a level of complexity but is critical in providing a complete understanding.Tools/technology developmentAddressing some of the priority questions fully will require development of new tools and technologies. While there have been major advances in recent years, there will be an increasing need to continue to develop sensitive and selective tools to measure and modulate immune cells and molecules
in vivo, particularly within the CNS. This applies to both human and animal models to study interactions in homeostasis and development as well as in disorders, where a lack of suitable tools often presents a major barrier to progress. For instance, being able to image and modulate CNS-resident or CNS-infiltrating immune cells and pathways in the living nervous system, without affecting the peripheral immune system, would be game changing, allowing questions to be asked that are not currently addressable around the dynamics of these cells and pathways
in vivo. Genetic tools, robust target-specific monoclonal antibodies, novel biological labels and synthetic biology may all contribute to the new toolbox.Analysis of the full repertoire of immune cells and molecules resident in the brain and nervous system will greatly benefit from the generation of detailed cell atlases that incorporate study of the peripheral immune system. This, however, may require development of new or more specific markers to study the different immune cell types in the first instance, and then progress to specific tools to track and manipulate cellular behaviour. The migratory nature and dynamic aspects of cell phenotypes of the immune compartment may provide additional challenges to cell atlas development.Collaborations beyond the biological sciences could be one way forward to develop or optimise these much-needed methods and tools. For example, working with medical physicists to develop neuroimaging tools sensitive to discrete CNS immune cell types or with bioengineers to develop cell type-specific targeting vehicles that could deliver pharmacological modulators directly to cells of interest, would be transformative from both a discovery and clinical perspective. Computational approaches are equally needed in order to integrate and analyse the large amount of clinical and basic research data generated and develop hypotheses for further experimental testing. This includes neuroimaging and biomarker data, eHealth records and the outputs from large scale ‘omics approaches.Translation to the clinicDissecting fundamental questions of neuroimmune interactions, such as those proposed here, can lead to an improved understanding of both systems and how disordered interactions can be potentially causal in major neurological disorders and mental illnesses. Increasing translational potential requires investigating changes in neuronal circuitry, synaptic plasticity, CNS development and ageing, and homeostasis and (dys)function in both human and model systems. Studying effects of immune-modulating therapies on the nervous system, behaviour, and psychopathology can help to elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms, leading to development of novel or repurposed immunotherapies. Progress in this area has been greatest in multiple sclerosis. Several immune-modulating drugs are now available to effectively delay progression of neurodegeneration and work by influencing peripheral immune cell trafficking to the CNS or modulating immune cell activation. Natalizumab (anti-alpha-4 integrin) has been shown to block entry of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, alleviating disease progression and further highlighting the importance of studying interactions between the peripheral immune system and the CNS for therapeutic gain
22. The high level of specificity conferred by the autoantibody-mediated diseases of the nervous system offer a direct link between neuroscience and immunology, allowing their parallel study in humans with these diseases
23.In psychiatry, interleukin (IL)-6 has been identified as a potential target in patients with depression and schizophrenia using population cohort and genetic studies
24,
25. However, patients receiving IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab) as acute graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis experienced significantly more depressive symptoms
26. This indicates that further investigation is required to test the therapeutic potential of targeting the immune system specifically in patients with depression, such as the Insight study, a proof-of-concept experimental medicine trial of tocilizumab
27. Emerging evidence has also demonstrated that increased inflammation may identify the phenotypic profile of patients more likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory augmentation across depression and psychosis
28,
29. This highlights how, when testing an immune-modulatory drug in a complex disease like depression (or dementia), it is essential to first demonstrate that inflammation is occurring and stratify inflammatory patients to the therapy. Successful translation to the clinic will require evidence triangulation using different approaches. Inflammation is likely to be relevant for some, but not all patients with mental health disorders, and not at all stages of illness. Further work is needed to understand the characteristics of inflammation-related depression and psychosis in order to inform patient selection in future interventional studies, thereby improving trial readouts, which is critical for clinical translation.Furthermore, developing systems to experimentally suppress or stimulate the immune system under controlled conditions can provide a platform to study neuroimmune dysregulation or understand its function in the CNS. However, this will require standardisation of clinical parameters to aid comparative studies and interoperability of cohort data, for example standardisation of methods for measurement of neurological features (fatigue, pain, cognition) and protocols for collecting and processing samples for immune characterisation. Achieving this goal would be facilitated by closer collaboration between research teams.ConclusionNeuroimmunology is an expansive field, which covers a vast breadth of science from fundamental interactions of cells to the effects of behaviour on the immune system. Bringing together different research communities is therefore critical to making progress, ensuring a joined-up approach with sharing of knowledge and learning. With these proposed research priorities for the field, we hope to provide a focal point for teams, galvanise collective endeavours and move neuroimmunology forward as a whole. The importance of considering the impact of context when addressing these questions is also highlighted. With multiple groups tackling each problem from different, but complementary or even synergistic angles, together they will provide an ever more granular picture of how interactions between the immune and nervous systems influence health and disease. By defining the underpinning and causal mechanisms through basic science as well as translational research in human cohorts, we anticipate impacting on health and facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.Achieving this vision will require the continued development of new and improved tools, open sharing and curation of data sets, multi- and inter-disciplinary teams working with colleagues in the wider biological sciences, STEM and social sciences, as well as forging partnerships with clinicians, patients and industry.Finally, these research priorities were developed by the research community, for the research community, as an attempt to identify the areas that most urgently need addressing to ultimately improve health, to start conversations and new collaborations, and coordinate existing efforts. By building upon the current strong knowledge base and bringing in new disciplines and perspectives, we hope to inspire not only new lines of enquiry but also encourage researchers from diverse backgrounds to become neuroimmunologists. Together, we can further our understanding of this increasingly important field which has the potential to make a major impact on health.Data availabilityNo data are associated with this article.1BohlenCJFriedmanBADejanovicB:

Seventeen very well-respected scientists from the United Kingdom came together to address these and other issues. They lay the groundwork for a path forward to move biomedical research on communication systems between the central nervous and immune systems into the clinic. The authors do a good job of acknowledging and documenting the progress in basic research made in this field during the past few decades. Nevertheless, there is a real need to further support this rapidly expanding field by trying to understand reciprocal systems of communication that are now known to exist between the immune system and brain. The authors make a compelling recommendation to create teams from a variety of academic disciplines to accomplish this goal and to advance the field. I agree and support all of this. It is admirable for a group of esteemed scholars to come together, presumably virtually in October 2020 during the COVID19 pandemic. As a result, they agreed to include their names on a paper that boldly proposes ten approaches, all to be accomplished within 10 years, to achieve their goals. The authors propose ten questions within four different frameworks: (a) The context of understanding the importance of bidirectional communication (e.g., afferent vs efferent); (b) Deciphering whether neuroimmune crosstalk is more important in some contexts that others (e.g., development vs aging) and the contribution of co-morbidities; (c) The need for advancement and development of newer technologies to non-invasively assess neuroimmune interactions in animals and humans; and (d) The importance of translating answers to these ten fundamental questions into treatments that help patients. These are all reasonable and important issues for discussion in health and disease. If accomplished, the entire neuroimmunology field will be much stronger in 2031 than it is now 2021. This is a well-written and persuasive article, but it could be strengthened. Although top-down (efferent) pathways are mentioned, the clear focus of this article is on bottom-up communication from the immune system to the brain, with the aim of improving/understanding/treating mental health disorders. There is only one question that directly asks how neural circuits, presumably from both the central and peripheral nervous systems, affect immunity. Yet, the recent review by Aysa Rolls and colleagues makes a convincing argument for brain regulation of a variety of immune events (
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0387-1).
1 As such, the case for efferent regulation of the immune system by the brain could be stronger. Natural ways to exploit immune-brain communication to promote health, as opposed to treatment with drugs, could be discussed in more detail. For example, Western medicine finally has recognized that there are non-pharmaceutical approaches that can improve mental health disorders. They are mindfulness and exercise in all forms, with the practice of mindfulness now blending with traditional Chinese meditation and exercise. Other aspects of Eastern medicine also offer promise. For example, a major criticism of the use of acupuncture for the treatment of human diseases is the lack of an anatomical pathway to mediate the effects of specific acupoints. That critique will now change with the recent publication in
Nature that defined a neuroanatomical loop between the periphery and brain and the subsequent efferent signal that defines the manner by which a specific acupoint inhibits LPS-induced inflammation (
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04001-4).
2
 Finally, it is curious that the noun “physiology” is never mentioned throughout the entire paper. Yet systemic physiology is based not only on structure and function but also on communication systems among various organs in the body. Lungs communicate with the brain to regulate blood gas levels and the heart communicates with the lungs for the same reason. The kidney and lungs communicate with one another to maintain acid-base balance. These systems form regulatory feedback loops, which control everything from reproductive cycles to stress responses. It seems that, in principle, immune-brain communication would not be much different from these well-accepted autonomic reflexes. Yet this paper seems to present immune-brain communication as a one-way street, which is either afferent or efferent. As such, more emphasis could be given to regulatory feedback loops. For example, over thirty years ago Hugo Besedovsky discovered one of these feedback systems by showing that a peripheral inflammatory stimulus (IL-1) caused release of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus, ultimately leading to the release of corticosterone from the adrenal cortex (
Science 1987; 238:524-526). These data defined a clear immune afferent signal to the brain that caused an efferent endocrine response that in turn regulates some aspect of the immune system. One can always quibble about the ten questions that the authors propose to lead the field forward. But perhaps the authors might consider asking an eleventh question: What are the important physiological immune-brain feedback regulatory control loops and how are they affected throughout the life span and in health and disease?Does the article adequately reference differing views and opinions?YesAre all factual statements correct, and are statements and arguments made adequately supported by citations?YesIs the Open Letter written in accessible language?YesWhere applicable, are recommendations and next steps explained clearly for others to follow?YesIs the rationale for the Open Letter provided in sufficient detail?YesReviewer Expertise:ImmunophysiologyI confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.References1

Cognitive impairment induced by cancer-related inflammation and stress-related psychiatric symptoms may be underlying mechanisms. We therefore studied the association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of these outcomes.MethodsFollowing a cohort of 388,443 cancer patients diagnosed between October 2005 and December 2014 in Sweden, we ascertained dispense of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before cancer diagnosis onward and defined the on-medication period as from date of drug dispense until the prescribed dosage was consumed. Follow-up time outside medicated periods and time from unexposed patients were defined as off-medication periods. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death due to suicide or accident, by comparing the on-medication periods with off-medication periods.ResultsIn total, 29.7% of the cancer patients had low-dose aspirin dispensed and 29.1% had non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed. Patients with aspirin use were more likely to be male than patients without aspirin use. Compared with off-medication periods, there was a 22% lower risk of accidental death (N = 651; HR 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 to 0.87) during on-medication periods with aspirin. The use of aspirin was not associated with risk of suicide (N = 59; HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.39). No association was noted between use of non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of suicide (N = 13; HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.18) or accidental death (N = 59; HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26).ConclusionsIntake of low-dose aspirin after cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of unnatural deaths among cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9.KeywordsAccidentAspirincancerNSAIDsSuicideCohort studyKarolinska InstituteOpen access funding provided by Karolinska Institute.issue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2022IntroductionThe impact of cancer and cancer treatment on cognition and mood changes has been well-characterized [1]. While improved treatment has increased the number of cancer survivors, studies have demonstrated that cancer patients experience increased symptoms of cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and fatigue during and after cancer treatment [2]. These symptoms subvert normal functioning of the central and peripheral nervous system, which may manifest in pathophysiological process of health consequences [3]. As a result, more cancer patients and survivors now suffer from stress-related health outcomes, including fatal and non-fatal injuries, accident, and suicide [4–7]..It is plausible that biological mechanisms such as inflammation induced by cancer or cancer treatment contribute to increased risk of accidents and other unnatural deaths in cancer patients. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and increases in response to some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy [8]. Several studies have identified a relationship between circulating pro-inflammatory markers and symptoms of cognitive impairment, mood and stress-related disorders, as well as peripheral neuropathy both at cancer diagnosis and during or soon after cancer treatment [9, 10]. Markers of inflammation such as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were noted up to 20 years after cancer treatment and coincide with symptoms of cognitive decline [11]. In a recent study, we demonstrated that aspirin was able to block tumour-induced memory impairment in mouse models of breast cancer, suggesting its potential to combat cancer-related cognitive and mood symptoms [12]. In humans, aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID use was shown to be associated with decreased risk of depression and depressive symptoms [13], especially in terms of continued use of low-dose aspirin [14]..Taking advantage of the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and a national cohort of incident cancer patients in Sweden, we aimed to explore the association between use of low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of suicide or death due to accident following a cancer diagnosis.MethodsStudy designDue to the availability of data on medication since July 2005, we identified all patients with a newly diagnosed cancer (N = 403,322) between October 2005 and December 2014 from the Swedish Cancer Register, which includes almost complete information on all cancers diagnosed in Sweden since 1958 onward [15]. All patients were cross-linked to the Swedish Causes of Death and Migration Registers using the personal identification numbers assigned uniquely to all residents in Sweden [16]. We excluded 155 patients who died and 14,724 patients who emigrated before cancer diagnosis, leaving 388,443 patients to be followed from the date of cancer diagnosis, until emigration (Migration Register), death (Causes of Death Register), or December 31, 2014, whichever occurred first. We used 7th Swedish revision of the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) codes to classify different cancer types (Supplementary Materials, Table S1).Ascertainment of exposuresThe Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information on prescribed and dispensed medications from all Swedish pharmacies since July 2005 [17]. All pharmacies, retailers and wholesalers across the country are obligated to report the sales on monthly basis with overall very good data quality [17]. Unused drugs are advised to be returned to the pharmacies for incineration. The proportion of all returned drugs was around 2.3–4.6% of the dispensed volume [18]. Medications in this register are classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system [19]. The register includes information on medicine types, prescription and dispensing dates, quantity, defined daily dose and prescription text [17]. Low-dose aspirin and most NSAIDs cannot be purchased over-the-counter without a prescription in Sweden [20]. Patients who had medications dispensed with ATC codes B01AC06, B01AC30 and B01AC56 were considered as medicated with lose-dose aspirin (limited to daily dose of 75 or 160 mg). We focused on low-dose aspirin that tends to be used in long term in the present study, because of its potential effect of reducing stress-related outcomes [14, 21]. Patients who had medications dispensed with ATC code M01A were considered as medicated with non-aspirin NSAIDs.We identified all low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed from 3 months before cancer diagnosis until the end of follow-up, because prescription drugs are dispensed for up to a three-month supply in Sweden. Multiple prescriptions at the same dispense date for the same medicine (2% for aspirin, 1.6% for non-aspirin NSAIDs) were summed up and unused medicines returned to the pharmacies were extracted from the amount of the previous dispense (0.3% for aspirin, 0.3% for other NSAIDs). Because of the time-varying nature of medication use, we constructed on- and off-medication periods for each patient after cancer diagnosis through information on dispense date and dosage according to the prescription text. The on-medication period was defined as the interval from the most recent dispense date of a specific NSAID, until the last day when the dispensed drug was estimated to be consumed. Time periods outside the on-medication periods among patients that had ever used NSAIDs, and among patients that did not use any NSAID during follow-up, were defined as off-medication periods (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1).Because the defined daily dose does not necessarily correspond to the recommended or prescribed daily dose, we estimated days on medication as the division of the total amount of dispensed drug by the prescribed daily dosage per medicated period for each patient. The information on prescribed daily dosage for each on-medication period was extracted from the prescription text, or from the defined daily dose when the prescription text was not available (25% for aspirin, 4% for non-aspirin NSAIDs).Ascertainment of completed suicide and death due to accidentThe Swedish Causes of Death Register collects nationwide information from 1961 onward, including dates and the underlying and contributing causes of death [22], with high accuracy [23]. We used the 10th Swedish revision of ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes X60-X84, V01-X59, and Y85-Y86 to ascertain deaths from suicide and accident (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Death due to accident was further classified as deaths due to transport accident, fall, accidental threat to breathing, unspecified fracture, or others.CovariablesPatients’ use of drug as well as their general health status may confound the association between aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of unnatural deaths from suicide and accident. To control for these confounding factors, we included socioeconomic status (education, occupation, cohabitation status), mental health status (history of psychiatric disorder), and general health status (Chronic Disease Score) as covariates. The Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA) was established by Statistics Sweden and collects data from labor market, and educational and social sectors annually for individuals over 16 years of age [24]. Information on the highest educational level, occupation, and cohabitation status at the time of diagnosis was retrieved from LISA for all cancer patients. Chronic Disease Score is a measure of comorbidity based on the aggregated number of prescribed medications. The score is a summary of weights from each comorbidity category represented by medication classes [25, 26]. As a proxy of general health status, we calculated a Chronic Disease Score, based on the prescribed medications before cancer diagnosis, for each patient [25], after excluding anxiolytics, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anti-inflammatory medications because of their close relationship with the exposure or other covariables. We defined history of psychiatric disorders as having any inpatient or outpatient hospital visit for psychiatric disorders from 1987 onward using the ICD-9 codes 290–319 and ICD-10 codes F10-F99. Because of the close link between psychiatric disorders and suicide and death due to accident [27, 28], we updated this variable per on- or off-medication period for each patient.Statistical analysisWe first described the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cancer patients, with and without medications, including sex, age at cancer diagnosis, calendar period of diagnosis (2005–2008, 2009–2011 or 2012–2014), highest educational level (> 12 years as after secondary school, 9–12 years as secondary school, < 9 years as primary school, or missing), occupation (blue collar, white collar, farmers, self-employed, retired or unemployed, or unclassified or missing), cohabitation status (cohabitation, non-cohabitation, or missing), cancer type (prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, hematopoietic malignancy, lung cancer, severe cancer [esophagus, liver and pancreas] and others), cancer stage (localized limited, localized advanced, regional spread, distant metastasis, unknown, or not applicable), history of psychiatric disorders (no or yes), and Chronic Disease Score (0, 1–2, 3–5, or > 6).To assess the impact of taking aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs separately, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of suicide and death due to accident after cancer diagnosis, by comparing the on-medication periods with the off-medication periods of aspirin, and of non-aspirin NSAIDs, separately. In the first model, we used time since cancer diagnosis as the underlying timescale, and additionally adjusted the estimates for age at diagnosis (continuous variable), sex, highest educational level, occupation, cohabitation status, and calendar year of diagnosis. A continuous function of time was modeled with restricted cubic splines. In a second model, we additionally adjusted for cancer type, cancer stage, and Chronic Disease score (continuous variable). In a third model, in addition to all variables adjusted for the second model, we also adjusted for history of psychiatric disorders. The three models were designed to demonstrate the roles of different covariables on the studied associations. To illustrate the temporal pattern of the association, we also estimated the hazard as a function of time using restricted cubic splines with three knots that were evenly distributed along time at risk, based on the third model.We performed sensitivity analyses. First, to assess the validity of our definition for on- and off-medication period, we defined the first month after each on-medication period also as on-medication period rather than off-medication period. Second, to separately evaluate the association for first-time use and repeated use of the medications, for each on- and off-medication period, we defined as with previous use if there was a previous on-mediation period since July 2005, and as without previous use if there was no previous on-medication period. Third, because a proportion of cancer patients had unknown stage at diagnosis, in a sensitivity analysis, we imputed unknown cancer stage to assess the influence of such missingness on the main results. Fourth, to exclude potential influence from other NSAIDs when investigating the effect of aspirin use (and vice versa), we compared the on-medication periods of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs with off-medication periods with neither aspirin nor non-aspirin NSAIDs. Finally, to assess the role of other medications with potential impact on cognitive function and psychiatric symptoms, we performed additional analysis with further adjustment for use of opioids (ATC code N02A), use of anxiolytics (ATC code N05B), or use of antidepressants (ATC code N06A).Because an association was mainly noted between the use of low-dose aspirin and accidental death, we also performed several secondary analyses to assess the robustness of this finding. First, because patients are often asked to discontinue aspirin use during surgical treatment to avoid major bleeding [29], we performed additional analysis to separately assess the studied associations within first year (as a proxy for the time window of primary cancer treatment including surgery) and beyond first year after cancer diagnosis. Second, to further alleviate the concern of residual confounding, we separately compared the on-medication periods with off-medication periods of the same individuals (within-individual comparison). Third, because individuals with different characteristics have been shown to have different risk of accidental death following a cancer diagnosis [30, 31], we separately analyzed the association by sex, age, cancer type, cancer stage, history of psychiatric disorders, Chronic Disease Score, highest educational level, cohabitation status, and employment status (employed vs. retired or unemployed). Finally, in addition to any death due to accident, we separately studied the association by major causes of accidental death.We found no major violation of the proportional hazards assumption in all analyses by plotting Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and STATA 14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA).The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden (Dnr 2015/1574–31). Individual informed consent was waived in this approval.ResultsIn total, 29.7% of the cancer patients had low-dose aspirin dispensed and 29.1% had non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed. Compared with patients without aspirin use, patients with aspirin use were more likely to be male, older at cancer diagnosis, less educated, unemployed or retired, and have higher Chronic Disease Score (Table 1). Patients with non-aspirin NSAID use were younger, more educated, more likely to be cohabitating, and had lower Chronic Disease Score, compared with patients without use of non-aspirin NSAIDs. A higher incidence of death due to accident than suicide was consistently noted during the follow-up (Supplementary Materials Fig. S2).Table 1Baseline characteristics of cancer patients according to their use of low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before diagnosis onward, a cohort study of 388,443 cancer patients diagnosed between Oct 2005 and Dec 2014 in SwedenLow-dose aspirinNon-aspirin NSAIDsPatients without use of either medication(N = 192,333)Patients without use of low-dose aspirin(N = 273,123)Patients with use of low-dose aspirin (N = 115,320)Patients without use of non-aspirin NSAIDs(N = 275,449)Patients with use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (N = 112,994)Male, N (%)134,055 (49.1)70,209 (60.9)145,684 (52.9)58,580 (51.8)95,413 (49.6)Mean age at diagnosis (SD), year65.27 (13.0)73.70 (10.2)69.18 (12.8)64.35 (12.2)66.70 (13.0)Calendar year of diagnosis, N (%)2005–200880,797 (29.6)43,430 (37.6)71,183 (25.8)53,044 (46.9)45,283 (23.5)2009–201191,471 (33.5)40,789 (35.4)92,512 (33.6)39,748 (35.2)62,482 (32.5)2012–2014100,855 (36.9)31,101 (27.0)111,754 (40.6)20,202 (17.9)84,568 (44.0)Highest educational level, N (%)Beyond secondary school71,038 (26.0)19,899 (17.3)62,018 (22.5)28,919 (25.6)48,441 (25.2)Secondary school111,169 (40.7)41,880 (36.3)106,489 (38.7)46,560 (41.2)76,880 (40.0)Primary school88,207 (32.3)51,940 (45.0)103,726 (37.6)36,421 (32.2)64,993 (33.8)Missing2709 (1.0)1601 (1.4)3216 (1.2)1094 (1.0)2019 (1.0)Occupation, N (%)Blue collar23,767 (8.7)3498 (3.0)16,918 (6.1)10,347 (9.2)14,852 (7.7)White collar52,211 (19.1)7721 (6.7)37,922 (13.8)22,010 (19.5)33,300 (17.3)Farmers2079 (0.8)625 (0.5)1873 (0.7)831 (0.7)1452 (0.8)Self-employed9401 (3.4)2420 (2.1)7674 (2.8)4147 (3.7)6117 (3.2)Retired or unemployed143,688 (52.6)86,694 (75.2)166,437 (60.4)63,945 (56.6)103,998 (54.1)Unclassified or missing41,946 (15.4)14,355 (12.5)44,597 (16.2)11,704 (10.4)32,614 (16.9)Cohabitation status, N (%)Cohabitating136,088 (49.8)56,219 (48.8)129,433 (47.0)62,874 (55.6)91,427 (47.5)Non-cohabitating106,358 (38.9)46,411 (40.3)107,994 (39.2)44,775 (39.6)74,280 (38.6)Missing30,677 (11.2)12,690 (11.0)38,022 (13.8)5345 (4.7)26,626 (13.8)Cancer type, N (%)Prostate cancer49,566 (18.1)26,095 (22.6)49,439 (18.0)26,222 (23.2)32,590 (16.9)Breast cancer43,544(15.9)10,755 (9.3)36,298 (13.2)18,001 (15.9)28,985 (15.1)Colorectal cancer30,024 (11.0)13,221 (11.5)31,576 (11.5)11,669 (10.3)21,764 (11.3)Non-melanoma skin cancer14,972 (5.5)10,289 (8.9)20,044 (7.3)5217 (4.6)11.894 (6.2)Hematopoietic malignancy18,518 (6.8)9425 (8.2)21,340 (7.7)6603 (5.8)14.155 (7.4)Lung cancer18,017 (6.6)8693 (7.5)19,965 (7.2)6745 (6.0)13,210 (6.9)Severe cancer (esophagus, liver and pancreas)12,267 (4.5)4494 (3.9)13,829 (5.0)2932 (2.6)10,055 (5.2)Others86,215 (31.6)32,348 (28.1)82,917 (30.1)35,646 (31.5)59,680 (31.0)Cancer stage at diagnosisa, N (%)Localized limited79,238 (29.0)28,324 (24.5)75,534 (27.4)32,028 (28.3)55,302 (28.7)Localized advanced16,403 (6.0)7570 (6.6)16,778 (6.1)7195 (6.4)11,295 (5.9)Regional spread29,086 (10.7)10,704 (9.3)26,872 (9.8)12,918 (11.4)19,221 (10.0)Distant metastasis29,759 (10.9)10,668 (9.2)30,902 (11.2)9525 (8.4)22,431 (11.7)Unknown100,119 (36.7)48,629 (42.2)104,015 (37.8)44,733 (39.6)69,929 (36.4)Not applicable18,518 (6.8)9425 (8.2)21,348 (7.7)6595 (5.8)14,155 (7.3)History of psychiatric disorders, N (%)No239,491 (87.7)99,110 (85.9)239,975 (87.1)97,777 (86.5)167,971 (87.3)Yes33,632 (12.3)16,210 (14.1)35,474 (12.9)15,217 (13.5)24,362 (12.7)Chronic Disease Score, N (%)0105,699 (38.7)9004 (7.8)75,296 (27.3)39,407 (34.9)70,037 (36.4)1–2111,484 (40.8)28,884 (25.1)97,093 (35.3)43,275 (38.3)77,666 (40.4)3–549,854 (18.3)65,309 (56.6)88,137 (32.0)27,026 (23.9)39,307 (20.4)> 66086 (2.2)12,123 (10.5)14,923 (5.4)3286 (2.9)5323 (2.8)Abbreviations: NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsaDefined by European Network of Cancer Registries Condensed TNM Scheme and staging system: localized limited (T-localized/N0/M0 or FIGO 0-I), localized advanced (T-advanced/N0/M0 or FIGO II), regional spread (any T/N+/M0 or FIGO III), distant metastasis (any T/any N/M+ or FIGO IV), or unknown stage.

Aspirin use was associated with a 22% lower risk of death due to accident (HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.87). The risk reduction in relation to aspirin use was also noted when comparing medicated periods to off-medicated periods of the same patient (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.98). No association was however noted for non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26). The risk reduction in death due to accident, in relation to use of low-dose aspirin was mainly noted from 1 year until 6 years after cancer diagnosis (Fig. 1B).The results did not change when including 1 month after on-medication period as exposed period (Supplementary Materials Table S3), when comparing to periods without prescription of any NSAIDs (Supplementary Materials Table S4), or with additional adjustment for use of other medications (Supplementary Materials Table S5). We found a lower risk of death due to accident in relation to repeated use of low-dose aspirin (HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.66) but not first-time use (Table 3). Imputation on unknown stage rendered similar results (Supplementary Materials Table S6).The risk reduction in death due to accident, in relation to use of low-dose aspirin, was not statistically significant during the first year (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.19) but statistically significant thereafter (HR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.98) after cancer diagnosis. The risk reduction was more prominent among male patients, younger patients (< 60), patients with hematopoietic malignancies, patients without a history of psychiatric disorders, patients with a higher Chronic Disease Score, and patients that were retired or unemployed (Supplementary Materials Table S7). In the analysis of causes of death due to accidents, we found a similar reduction in the risks for different types of accidents in relation to use of aspirin (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Association of low-dose aspirin use with the risk of death due to different types of accidents, a cohort study of 388,443 cancer patients diagnosed between Oct 2005 and Dec 2014 in Sweden*. *Analyses were adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, cancer stage, cancer type, highest education level, occupation, residence, cohabitation status, history of psychiatric disorders, chronic disease score, and calendar year of cancer diagnosis. Time since cancer diagnosis was used as the underlying timescaleDiscussionUsing a nationwide cohort study, we assessed the association between use of low-dose aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of unnatural deaths among cancer patients. We found that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a 22% lower risk of death due to accident but not suicide whereas use of non-aspirin NSAIDs was not associated with the risk of either death due to accident or suicide. When separately analyzing prevalent use and incident use, we found that prevalent use of either aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was associated with a lower risk of death due to accident, whereas incident use of such medication was not. Our study provides evidence for a potentially beneficial effect of NSAID use, especially low-dose aspirin and long-term use, in reducing severe accidents after cancer diagnosis.Strength and limitationsThe major strength of this study includes the nationwide population-based cohort design, the complete follow-up, and the prospectively and independently collected information on medication, cancer, and death outcomes, which largely minimized the potential risk of selection and information biases. The use of dispensed rather than prescribed medications, the use of prescription text to define medication status, and the time-varying definition of medication use served to limit potential misclassification of the exposure. Because medications are largely financed by the universal healthcare insurance to each resident in Sweden, the findings of the present study are not likely greatly influenced by other factors such as socioeconomic status.One limitation of the study is that the Prescribed Drug Register does not include medications administered during hospitalization or in nursing home. This may result in misclassification of the exposure to some extent. However, it is unlikely that such misclassification is differential in terms of the outcomes. Another limitation is that we did not have information on the actual consumption of medications among patients defined as exposed to these medications according to drug dispense. In our study, 84.0% patients ever medicated with low-dose aspirin had at least two dispensing records, indicating that vast majority of the users of low-dose aspirin had likely consumed the dispensed medications. Further, because patients who did not consume medications as expected should ideally have contributed their person time to the off-medication periods rather than on-medication periods, this misclassification is expected to have led to underestimation of the inverse association noted for aspirin use. Because information on other potential confounders such as lifestyle factors was unavailable, and there was a proportion of cancer patients with unknown cancer stage, residual confounding remains a concern. The similar results obtained in the within-individual comparison and after multiple imputation for unknown cancer stage alleviated this concern to some extent. There is also a concern of indication bias, namely that the indications for NSAIDs use - mostly inflammatory conditions - might have biased the estimates of the studied associations. This is likely most relevant for first-time use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs, for both of which an increased risk of death due to incidents was noted. As a result, the overall association as reported in Table 2 could also have been biased partially due to this. Finally, the possibility of chance findings cannot be excluded completely because of the smaller number of outcomes, and this is especially true for completed suicide.Interpretation of resultsThe excess risks of suicide and accidents among cancer patients have been reported in many countries [4, 6, 32, 33]. Although more than twice as many cancer patients die from accidents than from suicide [6, 31], risk of death due to accident and its underlying reasons has been less investigated. Psychological distress related to receiving a cancer diagnosis and treatment, together with its resultant psychiatric symptoms such as depression, fatigue and poor concentration, may trigger the occurrence of both suicide and accidents in cancer patients [7, 34]. To our knowledge, potential preventive strategies have not been developed to mitigate the elevated risk of these outcomes. In our study, we found that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of death due to accident. This finding, in line with previous studies, supports a potential role of aspirin use in reducing stress-related outcomes due to its anti-inflammatory properties [35, 36]. Indeed, both cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy have been associated with inflammation in cancer patients, which was further correlated with deficits in motor function [37, 38] and risk of external injuries [39, 40]. Aspirin may intervene in this process and modify the risk. Although not statistically significant, it seems the lowest estimate on risk reduction was observed among patients with severe cancers (cancer in esophagus, liver or pancreas). It is possible that this group of patients can potentially benefit more from the anti-inflammatory property of aspirin due to their high level of either tumor-induced or treatment-associated inflammation [41, 42].The lack of statistically significant association between low-dose aspirin and risk of death due to suicide may indicate indeed a lack of association. However, it is also possible that an underlying association is masked by methodological issues. This contention is in particular compelling given recent findings showing that aspirin use reduces the risk of depression [21], which is a major predictor of suicide [7]. Unlike unpredictable death due to accident, completed suicide is intentional. During the immediate time period before suicide, patients might stop taking or dispensing medications [43]. This could have led to different kinds of biases. For instance, if the patients had dispensed aspirin recently, they would be counted as exposed to aspirin despite not actually using it. Alternatively, before suicide, patients might be less likely to dispense prescribed medications, leading to an artificial protective effect, i.e., less patients would have dispensed aspirin during the time before suicide compared to expected. Another possible explanation for the lack of a statistically significant association is the lack of statistical power because of the smaller number of completed suicide. Moreover, suicide is known to be a challenge in classifying causes of death, and can be misclassified as deaths due to accident [44]. When combining completed suicide and deaths due to accident as one outcome, we found a 21% lower risk of unnatural deaths associated with the use of low-dose aspirin. A protective effect of low-dose aspirin on the risk of suicide following a cancer diagnosis can therefore not be ruled out.Prevalent use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, but not incident use, was found to be associated with a lower risk of accidental death. Non-aspirin NSAIDs are a class of drugs with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic therapeutic properties [45]. Because of their side effect on gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems when used chronically [46, 47], non-aspirin NSAIDs are recommended for use at the lowest effective dose, and for short-term use when possible [48]. In our study, the average duration of exposure to non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.4 months, corresponding to 4% of exposed follow-up time) was substantially shorter compared with the average duration of exposure to low-dose aspirin (16 months, corresponding to 77% of exposed follow-up time). This is also reflected by the greater numbers of outcomes among on-medication periods with aspirin compared to the on-medication periods with non-aspirin NSAIDs (see Table 2 for instance). As a result, the null overall association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of death due to accident might be due to chance (or lack of statistical power). In a sensitivity analysis, we observed an inverse association between prevalent use of both aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs, but not incident use of either, and risk of death due to accident. These results suggest that long-term use of NSAIDs, whether aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs, is likely to be associated with a lower risk of death due to accident among cancer patients. The overall null association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of death due to accident might therefore be attributable to the fact that most of the non-aspirin NSAIDs are used in short term whereas short-term use of such medication is unlikely to be associated with a lower risk of death due to accident among cancer patients. Taken together, these results might indicate the potential role of the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs in modulating the risk of accidents among patients with cancer.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the use of low-dose aspirin might be associated with a lower risk of death due to accident among patients with cancer.Supplementary InformationAdditional file 1.AbbreviationsNSAIDNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsICDInternational Classifications of DiseasesATCAnatomical Therapeutic ChemicalLISALongitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market StudiesHRHazard RatioCIConfidence IntervalPublisher’s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.AcknowledgementsNot applicable.NotesPrior presentations: This work has been presented in the doctoral thesis book of the first author by Karolinska Institutet library.Authors’ contributionsConception and design: Qing Shen, Arvid Sjölander, Fang Fang.

Circadian disruption is known to alter inflammatory responses and impair immune function. However, there is limited understanding of how circadian disruption modulates cancer-induced inflammation. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and is linked to worse prognosis and impaired brain function in cancer patients. Here, we investigated the effect of circadian disruption on cancer-induced inflammation in an orthotopic breast cancer model. Using a validated chronic jetlag protocol that advances the light-cycle by 8 ​h every 2 days to disrupt circadian rhythms, we found that circadian disruption alters cancer-induced inflammation in a tissue-specific manner, increasing inflammation in the body and brain while decreasing inflammation within the tumor tissue. Circadian disruption did not affect inflammation in mice without tumors, suggesting that the impact of circadian disruption may be particularly detrimental in the context of underlying inflammatory conditions, such as cancer. Importantly, circadian disruption did not affect tumor burden, suggesting that increased inflammation was not a result of increased cancer progression. Overall, these findings identify the importance of healthy circadian rhythms for limiting cancer-induced inflammation.Highlights•Circadian disruption enhances cancer-induced inflammation in the body and brain.•The profile of inflammatory cytokines altered by circadian disruption is tissue specific.•Changes in inflammatory profiles by circadian ​disruption are not due to enhanced tumor burden.KeywordsChronic jetlag4T1 breast CancerCytokinesNeuroinflammationMetastasisClock genesCircadian rhythms1IntroductionDisruption of circadian rhythms affects the immune system and alters inflammatory responses (Cuesta et al., 2016). Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated cycles that regulate many physiological processes, including metabolism, cellular proliferation, immune function, and neurocognitive function (Baxter and Ray, 2020). In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is the body's master circadian clock, which synchronizes and aligns circadian rhythms throughout the body in response to environmental light/dark patterns (Weaver, 1998). Disruption to light/dark patterns can cause disruption of circadian rhythms (Vetter, 2020). Shift-work, trans-meridian flights (jetlag), and pervasive exposure to artificial light at night are all known to disrupt circadian rhythms (Cain et al., 2020; Pilorz et al., 2018).The importance of robust circadian rhythms for health and well-being is now accepted (Allada and Bass, 2021), and disruption of circadian clocks is associated with many chronic health issues including cancer. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated increased cancer rates in populations susceptible to circadian disruption like shift workers (Fagundo-Rivera et al., 2020; Pariollaud and Lamia, 2020), and circadian rhythm disruption has been shown to influence efficacy and toxicity of cancer treatments like chemotherapy in patients (Hrushesky, 1985; Lévi, 1996). Preclinical cancer models support these findings with evidence that circadian disruption enhances cancer progression (Aiello et al., 2020), impairs anti-cancer immunity (Hadadi et al., 2020), and promotes tumor resistance to chemotherapy (Xiang et al., 2015, 2019). One key mechanism linking the circadian system and cancer is inflammation (Sulli et al., 2019), which is likely bidirectional. Inflammation has been demonstrated to disrupt circadian rhythms and blunt clock gene expression (Guo et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2019). On the other hand, disruption of circadian rhythms affects the immune system and alters inflammatory responses (Cuesta et al., 2016). Moreover, cancer itself has been shown to flatten circadian rhythms in Ly6cHi (proinflammatory) monocytes in a mouse model of breast cancer (Sullivan et al., 2019).Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) that promotes cancer progression (Deshmukh et al., 2019), and is associated with poor prognosis (Diakos et al., 2014), reduced treatment efficacy (Slaviero et al., 2003), and cancer-related morbidities including fatigue and cognitive and affective dysfunction (Lacourt et al., 2018; Pyter et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2018). Inflammatory cytokines can be produced by tumor cells (Walker et al., 2018) or tumor-associated stromal cells (Solinas et al., 2009), and once in circulation can have detrimental systemic effects (Diakos et al., 2014). Cancer-induced inflammation can also promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators in organs distant to the tumor site, including the brain (Santos et al., 2019). Treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin reduces long-term mortality from cancer (Rothwell et al., 2011) and reduces distant metastasis (Rothwell et al., 2012), demonstrating that inflammation can directly affect long-term outcomes in clinical populations. While it has been shown in non-cancer settings that circadian disruption dysregulates inflammatory responses (Baxter and Ray, 2020) and is linked to cognitive and affective dysfunction (Karatsoreos et al., 2011; Otsuka et al., 2020), it is not known whether circadian disruption modulates cancer-induced inflammation.Here, we implanted mammary carcinoma cells into mice with established circadian disruption to determine how circadian disruption affects cancer-induced inflammation. Using a validated chronic jetlag protocol to disrupt circadian rhythms we investigated changes in cancer-associated inflammatory gene expression in distinct sites of the body and brain - the hypothalamus which houses the master clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus), the liver which is anatomically and functionally distinct from the orthotopic tumor site (mammary fatpad) and known to be sensitive to circadian disruption (Ferrell and Chiang, 2015), and the tumor itself. We also explored whether altered inflammation was associated with changes in primary tumor growth, metastasis, memory impairment, and depression-like behavior. We chose to explore the impact of circadian disruption using 4T1.2 mammary tumor-induced inflammation because the link between breast cancer and circadian rhythms is well established in the clinic and in preclinical studies (Fagundo-Rivera et al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2019), and we have previously characterized the effect of mammary tumors on memory and sickness behavior using this model (Walker et al., 2018). The findings demonstrate that circadian disruption enhanced the inflammatory profile induced by cancer, which may have important implications for survival outcomes and quality of life for cancer patients exposed to environmental factors that disrupt circadian rhythms.2Methods2.1Animals and ethics80 BALB/c female mice (8–12 weeks old) (Monash University, Australia) were used in this study and housed individually in standard shoebox cages in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment. Food and water were available ad libitum. All procedures involving mice were carried out under protocols approved by the Monash University Animal Ethics Committee (protocol number MIPS.2017.46) and in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. Animals were monitored daily to ensure they were not experiencing distress.2.2Experimental designMice were randomly allocated to experimental groups of 10 per group (12:12 light-dark cycle ​± ​tumors; jetlag ​± ​tumors) across 2 replications. Briefly, one week prior to tumor cell or vehicle injection, mice remained on either a 12:12 ​h light:dark schedule or began exposure to the jetlag protocol. Tumor growth, metastasis, body weights and behavior were assessed across the course of the experiment until day 26 when the light schedules of mice aligned and tissue was collected for examination. The experimental timeline is outlined in Fig. 1A.Fig. 1Experimental design and effect of chronic jetlag on clock gene expression. A. Experimental design used to evaluate the effects of chronic jetlag on cancer-induced inflammation. B, C. Graphical representations of the stable and rotating light schedules used to induce chronic jetlag. D. Expression of clock genes in liver tissue as determined using qRT-PCR (n ​= ​3–5 per group).

Tumor cells were transduced to express codon-optimized luciferase and mCherry under control of the ubiquitin C promoter (Kaminskas et al., 2013). Cell line identity was confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling (Cellbank, Australia). Cells were determined to be mycoplasma free before injection using a MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Australia) or using primers as previously described (Uphoff and Drexler, 2002).2.4Breast cancer modelFor this study, the 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma cell line was chosen as 4T1 derived tumors have been shown to induce higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, liver and serum compared to other mammary tumor cell lines (Walker et al., 2017). Furthermore, we have previously characterized the cytokines and chemokines released by these cells in vitro (Walker et al., 2018). 1 ​× ​105 4T1.2 luciferase tagged tumor cells were injected in 20 ​μL PBS (Invitrogen, USA) into the left 4th mammary gland of anesthetized (3% isoflurane) mice. Control (sham) non-tumor bearing mice received injections of 20 ​μL PBS into the left 4th mammary fat pad under anesthesia. Primary tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging under 3% isoflurane anesthesia until tumors became palpable and signal saturation occurred (after day 10 of growth). Tumors were then monitored by digital calliper every 2–3 days with primary tumor volume calculated using the formula: (length ​× ​width2)/2. Distant metastasis was monitored twice weekly by bioluminescence imaging under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were injected with d-luciferin (150 ​mg/kg, Promega) via tail vein, and primary tumor burden and metastasis was quantified using an IVIS Lumina II (PerkinElmer) (Kim-Fuchs et al., 2014; Sloan et al., 2010). Non-tumor bearing mice that received PBS underwent identical procedures as tumor bearing mice including anesthesia.2.5Circadian rhythm disruptionTo determine the impact of circadian disruption on cancer-induced inflammation, the light schedule of mice in the experimental group was advanced manually by setting an analogue light switch timer forward by 8 ​h every two days. For example, lights may turn on at 0700 and off at 1900 but turn back on at 1100 allowing only 4 ​h of darkness that day, whereas control mice were kept on a stable 12:12 ​h light:dark cycle (Fig. 1C). This chronic jetlag protocol disrupts circadian rhythms in rodents (Filipski et al., 2004), without impacting total sleep quantity (Gao et al., 2020). Mice in the control condition were maintained on a stable 12:12 ​h light:dark schedule (Fig. 1B). To avoid exposing control mice to light during scheduled dark periods, which enhances tumor progression (Agbaria et al., 2019), all testing was conducted during the light phase, within 4 ​h of lights-on relative to each light cycle condition. Upon arrival at our institute, mice were stabilized on a consistent 12:12 ​h light:dark schedule for a minimum of two weeks, after which half of the mice began the chronic jetlag protocol. Mice were maintained on either the stable light/dark schedule or the chronic jetlag schedule starting one week prior to tumor cell injection and continuing until the end of the experiment. During light phases, light levels were a maximum of 170 lux in the housing room, using overhead fluorescent white light. During dark phases, mice were kept in very low light levels (<0.3 lux). The timing of euthanasia and tissue collection for molecular and biochemical analyses occurred on a day when the timing of the light schedule coincided for both the control and chronic jetlag groups.2.6Behavioral testingMemory and depression-like behavior were used to examine changes in mood and neurocognitive function in response to circadian disruption and mammary adenocarcinoma. Experimenters were unaware of the treatment conditions of mice during behavioral testing. Memory changes were assessed using the novel object/novel place recognition test and depression-like behavior using the forced swim and sucrose preference tests. All mice underwent testing in the novel object/novel place recognition test and forced swim test (n ​= ​20 per group). Half of the mice in each group were tested on the sucrose preference test (n ​= ​10 per group).Memory assessment. The novel object/novel place recognition test was conducted in a separate testing room under low lighting (<1.3 lux, at level of test arena), achieved with a low wattage lamp facing into a corner of the testing room. Mice were habituated and tested within a 40 ​min window. Mice were tested one week after initiation of the chronic jetlag protocol (i.e. 24 h prior to tumor cell injection) and one week after. We have established previously that decreased performance on the novel object/novel place recognition test is observable within a week of tumor inoculation (Walker et al., 2018) and thus, an examination past this time point, as cancer burden becomes greater, was deemed unlikely to show possible synergistic effects between circadian disruption and tumor development on cognition.To acclimate, mice were exposed to the arena 2–3 times for 5 ​min and then underwent habituation to the novel object/novel place recognition task 3–4 times prior to the start of the experiment to ensure mice reached 65% or greater novel object recognition. This was necessary to ensure mice had adequate exposure to the arena in order to reduce aversiveness given testing was conducted during their light phase when mice are less active. The novel object/novel place recognition test was performed and analyzed with Viewer III software (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany), as described previously (Walker et al., 2018). Novel object recognition was calculated by determining the percentage of time spent with the novel object divided by the total time exploring all the objects in the arena. Seventeen mice were excluded because they spent less than 20 ​s exploring the familiar objects in the learning phase.Assessment of depression-like behavior. Sucrose preference was assessed by providing mice with access to two water bottles throughout the experiment. One bottle contained drinking water and the other bottle contained 1% (w/v) sucrose in drinking water. The percentage of sucrose solution over the total liquid consumed was calculated. The amount of plain water and sucrose solution consumed was weighed and changed every 2–3 days or whenever mice were removed from their cages for testing. Following tumor cell injection, sucrose preference for each mouse was averaged across three time periods: early (2–10 days post-injection), mid (10–17 days post-injection), and late (17–26 days post-injection) stages of cancer progression.The forced swim test was recorded in complete darkness under infrared lighting 9 days after tumor cell injection as described previously (Walker et al., 2013). Briefly, mice were placed individually into a plastic cylinder (20 ​cm diameter) filled to a depth of 15 ​cm of water maintained at 24 ​± ​1 ​°C. The same water and bucket were used for a maximum of two mice before being changed. FST lasted for 6 ​min and mice were immediately returned to their home cage. The total time spent immobile was determined by an experimenter unaware of treatment conditions.2.7Tissue collectionMice were euthanized using CO2 at 26 days after tumor cell injection. Culling and tissue collection occurred at a consistent time-point, between 2 and 4 ​h after lights on, with collection counterbalanced between groups. Following euthanasia, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS to clear blood from tissue which may confound gene expression analysis. Then, brains were removed and the hypothalamus dissected out and frozen immediately on dry ice. Livers, spleens and primary tumors were dissected, weighed, and frozen immediately on dry ice. All tissues were stored at −80 ​°C until processing.2.8Gene expression analysisQuantitative real-time PCR was used to assess tissue-specific changes in the expression of genes related to inflammation, circadian rhythm regulation, and cellular senescence, caused by tumors and chronic jetlag. Tissue from mice that underwent all behavioral procedures was selected for gene expression analysis. Following extraction and quality control, final group sizes used for gene expression analysis for each tissue are: Hypothalamus: 12:12/Sham (n ​= ​7), 12:12/Tumor (n ​= ​6), Jetlag/sham (n ​= ​4), Jetlag/Tumor (n ​= ​5); Liver: 12:12/Sham (n ​= ​4), 12:12/Tumor (n ​= ​3), Jetlag/sham (n ​= ​5), Jetlag/Tumor (n ​= ​4); and Tumor: 12:12/Tumor (n ​= ​8), Jetlag/Tumor (n ​= ​8). RNA was extracted from the hypothalamus, liver and primary tumor using the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Assessment of RNA quality and concentration was carried out with the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer and Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 ​μg total RNA per sample using SuperScript® First-Strand Synthesis Kit IV and random hexamers following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). We measured expression of the genes Per1, Cry1, Clock and Bmal1/Arntl for their role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. We measured the cytokine-related genes Il6, Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Ifngr2 for their role in inflammatory processes, and Cox2 and Stat3 for their regulatory roles in cytokine signaling. The mRNA expression of 15 genes was measured in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using pre-designed Taqman Gene Expression Assays for: 1) inflammation genes: Il6 (Mm00446190_m1), Il1b (Mm00434228_m1), Il10 (Mm01288386_m1), Tnf (Mm00443258_m1), Ifngr2 (Mm00492626_m1), Cox2 (Mm03294838_g1), and Stat3 (Mm01219775_m1); 2) circadian clock genes: Per1 (Mm00501813_m1), Cry1 (Mm00514392_m1), Clock (Mm00455950_m1), Bmal1/Arntl (Mm00500223_m1); and 3) housekeeper genes: Tbp (Mm00446973_m1) and Ubc (Mm01201237_m1). No reverse transcriptase controls and no template controls were included to rule out genomic DNA contamination and reagent contamination, respectively. Normalized relative quantities (2−ΔΔCt) of each mRNA were calculated for each gene and normalized against the geometric mean of Tbp and Ubc for each mouse, that did not differ between groups.2.9Statistical analysisTwo-way ANOVAs (light cycle, tumor, light cycle ​× ​tumor) were used to assess the effects of 4T1.2 tumors and circadian disruption on: expression of each gene in liver or hypothalamus; behavior in the sucrose preference test, forced swim test or novel object/novel place recognition test; and spleen weight. There were two between-subjects factors – light cycle (two levels: control vs. chronic jetlag) and tumor (two levels: 4T1.2 vs. PBS vehicle control). Mixed-design repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to assess the effects of 4T1.2 tumor cells and light cycle disruption on sucrose preference following tumor cell injection, bodyweight and primary and metastatic tumor growth with ‘time’, defined as days post-tumor injection as the within-subjects factor. A Greenhouse-Geisser correction epsilon (ε) was used to correct for violations of sphericity. Where significant main or interaction effects were found, post-hoc Fisher's least significant difference tests were used to test for pairwise differences between groups. One-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of the light cycle (control vs. chronic jetlag) on the expression of each gene in primary tumors. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess differences in final tumor mass, sucrose preference, and bodyweight before 4T1.2 tumor cell injection. Significance was set a priori at p ​< ​0.05 (two-tailed).3Results3.1Chronic jetlag alters clock gene expression in the liverTo confirm that chronic jetlag exposure disrupted circadian rhythms, we evaluated changes in expression of clock genes, Clock1, Bmal1, Cry1, and Per1 in liver and brain. Chronic jetlag exposure increased Bmal1 expression in the liver of non-tumor bearing mice (jetlag main effect; F(1, 12) ​= ​4.052, p ​= ​0.038); Fig. 1D). Bmal1 is a key component of the mammalian molecular clock, where the Clock1 and Bmal1 proteins form dimers that inhibit Bmal1 and Clock1 transcription, creating a transcriptional/translational feedback loop with a ∼24 ​h cycle (Hernandez-Rosas et al., 2020). No other statistically significant differences in circadian gene expression in the liver or hypothalamus were found. These findings are consistent with evidence demonstrating that the chronic jetlag protocol causes phase-shifting in clock gene expression profiles (Iwamoto et al., 2014).3.2Tumors induce inflammation in the liver and hypothalamus which is exacerbated by chronic jetlagTo determine how chronic jetlag impacts cancer-induced neuroinflammation, we assessed cytokine and Stat3 gene expression within the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus was selected because it is known to be sensitive to changes in peripheral inflammation (Radler et al., 2014) and because it houses the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian clock (Weaver, 1998). Tumors increased expression of hypothalamic Tnf (tumor main effect: F(1, 16) ​= ​7.600, p ​= ​0.014) and Il1b (tumor main effect: F(1, 16) ​= ​26.142, p ​< ​0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed that only tumor bearing mice exposed to chronic jetlag demonstrated increased hypothalamic Tnf expression, suggesting that chronic jetlag affects cancer-induced inflammation in this organ (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Effect of jetlag on cancer-induced inflammation. Expression of inflammation-related genes as determined using qRT-PCR in: A. hypothalamus; B. liver. C. Splenomegaly induced by tumors. D. Expression of inflammation-related genes as determined using qRT-PCR in tumors.

The liver was chosen because liver function is tightly controlled by circadian rhythms and circadian disruption alters gene expression in this organ (Ferrell and Chiang, 2015). While the presence of a tumor on its own had no effect on hepatic Cox2 expression, chronic jetlag induced hepatic Cox2 expression (chronic jetlag ​× ​tumor interaction: F(1, 12) ​= ​6.547, p ​= ​0.025; chronic jetlag main effect; F(1, 12) ​= ​4.782, p ​= ​0.049), and post-hoc analysis showed this interaction in tumor bearing mice only (Fig. 2B). While the presence of a tumor increased Il6 expression in the liver, chronic jetlag nearly doubled cancer-induced hepatic Il6 expression (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 10) ​= ​8.467, p ​= ​0.016; tumor main effect: F(1, 10) ​= ​31.560, p ​< ​0.001; Fig. 2B). Tumors increased expression of hepatic Tnf (tumor main effect: F(1, 12) ​= ​20.073, p ​= ​0.001), Il1b (tumor main effect: F(1, 12) ​= ​45.016, p ​< ​0.001), and Stat3 (tumor main effect; F(1, 12) ​= ​25.311, p ​< ​0.001), but these factors were unaffected by chronic jetlag (Fig. 2B).To determine if changes in brain and liver inflammation were associated with other markers of peripheral inflammation we assessed spleen weight: a measure of myeloid cell expansion and inflammation in tumor bearing mice (Bronte and Pittet, 2013; Steenbrugge et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2017). Spleen mass increased in tumor bearing mice compared to non-tumor bearing mice, as previously reported (Walker et al., 2018, Fig. 2C), while exposure to chronic jetlag had no effect on splenomegaly caused by tumors (tumor main effect: F(1, 72) ​= ​236.854, p ​< ​0.001) (Fig. 2C). These findings show that chronic jetlag exerted organ-specific effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines in cancer-bearing mice, but not in tumor-free mice.3.3Chronic jetlag exposure decreased expression of Il1b in tumorsInflammatory signaling within the tumor microenvironment affects tumor progression and metastasis (Shalapour and Karin, 2015). To determine how chronic jetlag impacts inflammation within the tumor microenvironment, we assessed cytokine and Stat3 gene expression in tumor tissue. Chronic jetlag decreased Il1b expression in tumors (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 13) ​= ​8.438, p ​= ​0.012), but did not modulate expression of other cytokines or Stat3 (Fig. 2D).3.4Changes in inflammation caused by chronic jetlag are not the result of increased primary tumor size or metastasisTo determine whether the effects of chronic jetlag on cancer-induced inflammation were a consequence of changes in cancer burden, we assessed in vivo changes in primary tumor growth and metastasis using bioluminescence imaging. Chronic jetlag increased primary tumor growth 10 days after tumor cell injection as measured by bioluminescence imaging (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 38) ​= ​4.797, p ​= ​0.035; time main effect: F(1.078, 40.979) ​= ​12.805, p ​= ​0.001, ε ​= ​0.539) (Fig. 3A and B). However, these differences were not reflected in calliper measurements following day 10 (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 32) ​= ​0.025, p ​= ​0.876; time main effect: F(2.076, 66.427) ​= ​27.477, p ​< ​0.001, ε ​= ​0.692; Fig. 3C), nor in the final tumor mass weighed ex vivo (t(36) ​= ​0.87, p ​= ​0.853; Fig. 3D). Chronic jetlag did not significantly affect metastasis (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 34) ​= ​1.294, p ​= ​0.263; time main effect: F(1.728, 58.767) ​= ​7.125, p ​= ​0.003, ε ​= ​0.576) (Fig. 3E). In summary, there was no significant difference in cancer burden at the end of the experiment, when assessment of inflammatory gene expression was conducted.Fig. 3Effects of chronic jetlag on tumor growth and metastasis.

BLI (p/s): bioluminescence intensity (photons/second).Fig. 33.5Impact of chronic jetlag on behavior and cognitionBecause inflammation is causally implicated in cancer-induced depression and memory impairment (Marquie et al., 2015; Otsuka et al., 2020; Pyter et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2018), we assessed the impact of chronic jetlag on cancer-induced depression-like behavior and memory impairment. To assess changes in mood-related outcomes, performance in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated. Chronic jetlag exposure promoted anhedonia in non-tumor bearing mice, decreasing sucrose preference compared to control mice maintained in stable light conditions (t(18) ​= ​2.765, p ​= ​0.013) (Fig. 4A). Chronic jetlag exposure decreased sucrose preference in non-tumor bearing mice only across early (2–10 days post-injection), mid (10–17 days post-injection), and late (17–26 days post-injection) stages of cancer progression (Fig. 4B; chronic jetlag ​× ​tumor interaction: F(1, 35) ​= ​5.452, p ​= ​0.025; chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 35) ​= ​4.862, p ​= ​0.034). The absence of jetlag-induced anhedonia in tumor bearing mice may reflect changes in metabolism caused by cancer (Schwartsburd, 2019) rather than a change in anhedonia per se. Tumor bearing mice showed a trend towards increased immobility in the forced swim test (tumor main effect: F(1, 73) ​= ​3.124, p ​= ​0.081), but this was not affected by chronic jetlag (F(1, 73) ​= ​0.278, p ​= ​0.6; Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Effects of chronic jetlag exposure and tumors on depression-like behavior, memory and sickness response.

Error bars represent SEM. #, ## indicates significant effect of jetlag exposure at the p ​< ​0.05 and 0.01 levels, respectively. ∗ indicates significant effect of 4T1.2 tumor cell injection at the p ​< ​0.05 level.Fig. 4The novel object/novel place recognition test is a functional tool to assess cognitive deficits in cancer models (Walker et al., 2018). Neither chronic jetlag nor tumors affected novel object recognition at 7 days post 4T1.2 tumor cell injection (chronic jetlag main effect: F(1, 58) ​= ​0.154, p ​= ​0.696; tumor main effect: F(1, 58) ​= ​0.535, p ​= ​0.468; Fig. 4D).To determine if behavioral findings were confounded by sickness, which occurs in the late stages (>26 days) of 4T1.2 cancer progression (Walker et al., 2018), we measured bodyweight. All mice gained weight from the start of the experiment (time main effect: F(3.108, 229.976) ​= ​19.625, p ​< ​0.001, ε ​= ​0.444; Fig. 4E) suggesting that tumor bearing mice were not overtly sick by the end of the experiment. Exposure to chronic jetlag increased body weight among non-tumor bearing mice, but not tumor bearing mice following tumor cell or sham injection (day 1 – day 26) (time ​× ​chronic jetlag interaction; F(3.108, 229.976) ​= ​3.566, p ​= ​0.014, ε ​= ​0.444; Fig. 4E). This is consistent with evidence demonstrating that circadian disruption is linked to metabolic dysfunction (for review: (Casiraghi et al., 2016; Shetty et al., 2018). Exposure to chronic jetlag did not affect bodyweight prior to 4T1.2 tumor cell injection (day −3 – day 0) (t(78) ​= ​1.089, p ​= ​0.279; Fig. 4E). These findings showed that exposure to chronic jetlag reduced sucrose preference and increased weight-gain in non-tumor bearing mice only.4DiscussionThis study demonstrates for the first time that disruption of circadian rhythms in tumor bearing mice exacerbates cancer-induced inflammation, independently of changes in primary tumor growth or metastasis. Circadian disruption increased inflammation in the presence of cancer only, suggesting that circadian disruption may be particularly detrimental for cancer patients. These effects were tissue and cytokine specific, which may have implications for optimising treatment using systemic cytokine targeting therapies. Because the impact of inflammation on cancer-related processes, such as metastasis, can be mediated by tumor cell-type (Greten and Grivennikov, 2019), understanding how circadian disruption impacts inflammatory processes throughout the body, and in different types of cancer, will be critical to improving outcomes in cancer patients with circadian disruption. Together with previous evidence demonstrating a role for inflammation in causing cancer-related cognitive dysfunction and poor prognosis, these findings highlight the importance of healthy circadian rhythms in managing cancer-induced inflammation.Circadian disruption enhanced cancer-induced inflammation in the brain and the body, but the inflammatory profile was tissue-dependent. Specifically, cancer-induced Tnf was potentiated in the hypothalamus by chronic jetlag whereas cancer-induced transcription of Il6 was sensitive to circadian disruption in the liver. These findings suggest that inflammation-mediated processes may be more vulnerable to disruption in cancer patients exposed to circadian disruption. For example, TNF signaling in the hypothalamus potentiates HPA-axis activity (Silverman et al., 2005), and the impact of chronic inflammation on HPA-axis function is linked to fatigue and depression in cancer patients (Ahmad et al., 2021; Schmidt et al., 2016). Meanwhile, hepatic Il-6 is an important regulator of the acute phase response (Ehlting et al., 2021) and is involved in metastatic spread in some types of breast cancer (Ara and Declerck, 2010; Asgeirsson et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2018), processes that may be further impacted in cancer patients experiencing circadian disruption. The impact of these organ-specific changes on the efficacy of systemic cytokine targeting therapies (e.g. anti-Il-6 antibodies) or associated side effects in cancer patients with circadian disruption is unknown, and may be an important consideration for optimising treatment with these therapies.In contrast to increased inflammation in the hypothalamus and liver, circadian disruption reduced Il1b expression within the tumor. Within the tumor microenvironment, interleukin-1 is primarily produced by immune cells (Zhang et al., 2020), suggesting that decreased Il1b expression in tumors found here may reflect changes in the function or number of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (Wu et al., 2018). Consistent with that, circadian disruption has been linked to immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment in a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer (Aiello et al., 2020). However, Il1b is associated with both pro- and anti-tumor effects (Bent et al., 2018) and further work is needed to determine the clinical significance of these changes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that circadian disruption exerts cytokine- and tissue-specific effects on cancer-induced inflammation. Because inflammatory microenvironments are also important regulators of pre-metastatic niche formation (Peinado et al., 2017) and organotropic metastasis (Chen et al., 2018), understanding how circadian disruption impacts inflammatory processes throughout the body, and in different types of cancer, will be critical to improving outcomes in cancer patients with circadian disruption.Circadian disruption exerted limited effects on growth of the primary tumor or metastasis, which may be due to the tumor model or the type and timing of circadian disruption. Exposure to artificial light at night and disruption of the light/dark cycle are two common environmental methods used to dysregulate circadian rhythms in rodents. Artificial light at night suppresses melatonin synthesis, enhancing tumor progression in mice via melatonin-dependent mechanisms (Agbaria et al., 2019; Zubidat et al., 2018). Methodological heterogeneity, including different rodent strains, tumor types, and relative timing of circadian disruption to tumor initiation/induction and length of study, means the mechanisms linking chronic jetlag to enhanced tumorigenesis are less clear. Three of four prior studies using a comparable chronic jetlag protocol to this study, in similarly aggressive tumors models, found that circadian rhythm disruption accelerates growth of heterotopically transplanted osteosarcoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Filipski et al., 2004, 2006), and Lewis lung carcinoma (Wu et al., 2012). Notably, the fourth study, using a cre-inducible lung tumor model, reported that circadian rhythm disruption after tumor initiation increased tumor growth but circadian rhythm disruption prior to tumor initiation did not (Papagiannakopoulos et al., 2016), which is consistent with our findings. This suggests that the specific timing of transition to circadian disruption may exert an important effect on tumor growth. While in vivo assessment of metastasis raised the possibility that circadian rhythms may modulate metastatic progression (Fig. 3E), different experimental designs are needed to determine this effect. For example, surgical resection of the primary tumor following the onset of metastasis would enable extended assessment of metastatic progression without the ethical constraints associated with large primary tumor size. Nevertheless, more research is required to determine how cancer progression is impacted by the susceptibility of different tumor types to circadian rhythm disruption, and how timing of the transition into circadian disruption impacts cancer progression. This may have important implications for human shift-workers, many of whom regularly transition between periods of recovery from, and exposure to, circadian disruption.Here, we investigated if the increased inflammation caused by circadian rhythm disruption in tumor bearing mice exacerbated memory impairment and depression-like behavior. Disruption of circadian rhythms promoted anhedonia, but neither chronic jetlag nor tumor status affected memory or depression-like behavior in the forced-swim test. We and others have demonstrated that cancer impairs cognition and increases depression-like behaviors in rodents (Pyter et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2018); however, this effect is not always observed (Walker et al., 2017). In addition, chronic jetlag has been shown to impair memory and increase immobility in the forced swim test in rats (Horsey et al., 2019). In the present study, it is possible that testing during the light (inactive) phase of the light/dark cycle masked the effects of cancer and chronic jetlag on performance in the novel object/novel place recognition test and forced swim test. Indeed, control mice without tumors showed a 10% reduction in novel object preference compared to our previous findings in mice tested in the dark (active) phase of the light/dark cycle using the same tumor model, same sex, and same strain of mice in the same testing facility (Walker et al., 2018). Given circadian rhythm disruption exacerbated cancer-induced inflammation, and inflammation is strongly implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (Bauer and Teixeira, 2019), further research is warranted to determine how elevated cancer-induced inflammation resulting from circadian rhythm disruption impacts cognition and affect-related behaviors.While the findings of this study improve our understanding of how circadian disruption interacts with cancer-induced inflammation, some limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. The timeframe of these experiments was constrained by ethical guidelines for metastatic disease. It is possible that changes in metastasis caused by circadian disruption would have been observable over a longer timeframe, as has been reported in a spontaneous metastatic breast cancer model (Hadadi et al., 2020), which progresses more slowly than the transplanted 4T1.2 model used here. Further research is needed to determine how circadian disruption affects metastasis in 4T1.2 mammary adenocarcinoma models. The use of cytokine gene-expression was selected as it allowed us to investigate tissue-specific inflammation without being confounded by the infiltration of systemic cytokines into tissue. It will be important for future work to determine how these changes in gene expression impact cytokine signaling function within different organs of the body and regions of the brain. Finally, future work should aim to determine how chronic circadian disruption impacts the temporal profile of cancer-induced inflammation, which may lead to optimized chronotherapeutic interventions in cancer patients with circadian disruption (Borniger et al., 2017).5ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that circadian disruption exacerbates cancer-induced inflammation in the liver and hypothalamus and demonstrates that the profile of cancer-induced inflammation is organ specific. The findings indicate that inflammation beginning in the body is not always directly reflected in the brain and demonstrates that differences in inflammatory signatures between the body and brain can be further magnified by circadian disruption. Cancer-induced inflammation is mediated by cancer type, stage, treatment, and location, suggesting that the impact of circadian disruption inflammation may also be mediated by these factors. In cancer patients, inflammation is associated with decreased survival and treatment efficacy (Diakos et al., 2014), and elevated risk of cancer-associated side effects including pain, cognitive impairment, and depression (Diakos et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2015; Santos and Pyter, 2018). Therefore, understanding how circadian rhythm disruption impacts the inflammatory profile induced by different types of cancer will help tailor treatments for cancer patients, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.FundingThis work was supported by the 10.13039/501100001026National Breast Cancer Foundation, Australia [PF-15-014]; the 10.13039/501100000925National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia [1147498]; Monash University Interdisciplinary Research Scheme Competitive, Australia; the 10.13039/100018093Schizophrenia Research Institute, Australia and 10.13039/100012769Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Australia.

Yet, pathological (i.e., prolonged or chronic) and transient (i.e., exertional) fatigue symptoms are traditionally considered distinct, compounding a separation between interested research fields within the study of fatigue. Within the clinical neurosciences, nascent frameworks position pathological fatigue as a product of inference derived through hierarchical predictive processing. The metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al., 2016) states that pathological fatigue emerges from the metacognitive mechanism in which the detection of persistent mismatches between prior interoceptive predictions and ascending sensory evidence (i.e., prediction error) signals low evidence for internal generative models, which undermine an agent’s feeling of mastery over the body and is thus experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Although acute, transient subjective symptoms of exertional fatigue have also been associated with increasing interoceptive prediction error, the dynamic computations that underlie its development have not been clearly defined. Here, drawing on the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis, we extend this account to offer an explicit description of the development of fatigue during extended periods of (physical) exertion. Accordingly, it is proposed that a loss of certainty or confidence in control predictions in response to persistent detection of prediction error features as a common foundation for the conscious experience of both pathological and nonpathological fatigue.KeywordsFatiguePredictive processingAllostasisExerciseInteroceptionMetacognitionissue-copyright-statement© The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2022IntroductionThe experience of fatigue is ubiquitous in both health and disease. Although the concept of fatigue is firmly embedded within modern life, typical lay understanding of what is meant when describing oneself as fatigued can be diverse and multifaceted. Dictionary definitions of fatigue (n.) include 1) “extreme tiredness resulting from mental or physical exertion or illness”; 2) “a reduction in the efficiency of a muscle or organ after prolonged activity”; and 3) “a lessening in one’s response to or enthusiasm for something, caused by overexposure” (Stevenson, 2010). Thus, fatigue is often used to describe a broad combination of physical, sensory, and cognitive epiphenomena. As such, colloquial understanding of fatigue may serve to complicate its formal study, exacerbate its multidimensionality (Karshikoff et al., 2017), and emphasise the need to clearly distinguish it from other related phenomena (e.g., sleepiness) which share common descriptors (e.g., “tiredness”; Shen et al., 2006).Currently, there is no universally accepted definition or agreed standard measure for the assessment of fatigue (Dittner et al., 2004; Kluger et al., 2013). Consequently, the study of fatigue has forged increasingly reductionistic approaches across divergent fields, fragmenting fatigue research (Pattyn et al., 2018). One common distinction is the separation of pathological fatigue from the “normal,” physiological fatigue that we all experience in everyday life. The latter is a transient, nonpathological symptom with an identifiable cause (e.g., physical or cognitive exertion), which wanes with the removal of the stressor (i.e., through rest). On the other hand, pathological fatigue is the prolonged (1-5 months) or chronic (>6 months) experience of symptoms (Jason et al., 2010), which are unalleviated by rest and may present as a primary symptom, a secondary symptom or a comorbidity within neurological diseases (Penner & Paul, 2017). Qualitative reports from patients indicate differences in both the severity and quality of fatigue experienced in disease (Flinn & Stube, 2010; Repping-Wuts et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2011) supporting this distinction. However, due to the absence of a universal and standardised measure of fatigue, quantification of these differences across health and disease may be limited by the type of fatigue assessed (e.g., trait vs. state) and the heterogeneity (e.g., uni- vs. multidimensional) of symptoms considered (Dittner et al., 2004). Indeed, the separate instruments used to assess chronic/trait versus acute symptoms of fatigue may in itself aid in perpetuating distinctions and introduce confounding affective influences (e.g., depression) on the interpretation of (trait/chronic) fatigue symptoms (c.f. Tseng et al., 2010). It remains unclear whether pathological and nonpathological fatigue can be considered fully distinct phenomena. Interestingly, a common feature of pathological fatigue is an exacerbation of symptoms following some form of acute exertion (Nijs et al., 2010). It is therefore conceivable that exertional fatigue is a fundamental component encompassed within the pathological experience of fatigue, supporting a common mechanism within both disease and health that ultimately functions to regulate energy expenditure and work output (Chaudhuri & Behan, 2004).Within the clinical neurosciences, several theories of pathological fatigue and its underpinning neurocomputations have recently been proposed, each aligned to contemporary understanding of brain function (Kuppuswamy, 2017; Stephan et al., 2016). Building upon early propositions that perception represents unconscious, knowledge-driven inference (Helmholtz, 1860), these contemporary accounts build upon the notion that our ability to perceive, act, attend, and learn may all be accounted for by viewing the brain as a self-evidencing inference machine (Dayan et al., 1995; Friston, 2005). Predictive processing, in which explanations of sensory states are not simply extracted from sensory input streams, but instead constructed through establishing causal structures that incorporate prior expectations of sensory inputs, is posited to be a core principle of brain function (Bubic et al., 2010; Clark, 2013; Friston, 2009; Hohwy, 2014). The consideration of how precisely the brain constructs perception at the forefront of emerging accounts of pathological fatigue contrasts with many current perspectives on the transient symptoms of fatigue in response to acute, protracted exertion in health. Although previous predictive processing accounts offer a common foundation to describe and formally distinguish pathological from nonpathological, exertional fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016), an explicit account of the dynamics of the inferential processes underpinning the development of the latter is yet to be clearly described. Our goal therefore is to extend the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al., 2016) and offer a more explicit account of the changing inferential processes that give rise to the conscious experience of fatigue during acute, transient exertion. We focus on how this framework may be applied to the study of transient fatigue symptoms arising from homeostatic perturbations incurred through sustained physical exercise.1What is Fatigue? – Fatigue vs. fatigabilityDespite the absence of a standardised definition of fatigue, recent taxonomical frameworks for the study of the various causes and consequences of fatigue have been proposed (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016; Kluger et al., 2013). These taxonomies has been applied to facilitate articulation of fatigue in both neurological conditions (Kluger et al., 2013) and in response to acute, physical exertion (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016). Within it, fatigue is described as a self-reported, disabling symptom incorporating two dimensions: a subjective dimension (“perceived fatigue”), associated with broad feelings linked to weariness and exhaustion, and/or an objective dimension (“performance fatigability”), denoting a reduction in some marker of (physical and/or cognitive) performance (Kluger et al., 2013). Although these aspects of fatigue may interact, they are ultimately considered distinct and may emerge independently (Kluger et al., 2013). In the context of physical exertion, recently proposed frameworks have expanded the subjective dimension such that it includes any change in perception that aids in regulating the performer and is referred to as “perceived fatigability” (Enoka & Duchateau, 2016). Examples experienced during a task may include the perceived level of effort required (Staiano et al., 2018)and/or changes in affective valence (Hartman et al., 2019). Although combining multiple axes under one broad rubric has appeal for describing the complex and constantly changing processes involved in the control of physical performance, the concept of “perceived fatigability” may risk confusing an already complicated and multifactorial phenomenon, such as fatigue, and may detract from its functional role in the context of physical exertion. That is, the subjective component of fatigue is often conflated and used interchangeably with concepts, such as perception of effort. Although related, these represent distinct constructs (Halperin & Emanuel, 2020; Micklewright et al., 2017) with separate functional consequences (Greenhouse-Tucknott et al., 2020).Fundamentally, fatigue represents a subjective symptom (Penner & Paul, 2017). Indeed, emphasis on changes in objective, performance-based markers of fatigue (i.e., fatigability), particularly within health, may capture only a small part of the total fatigue process since performance may be maintained through goal-orientated control processes at the expense of the perception of fatigue (Hockey, 2011; Hockey, 2013). It also is important to recognise that acute performance decrements may emerge following protracted exertion in response to other transient, affective states, such as boredom. Boredom and fatigue may be differentiated based on the level of arousal engendered by a task, corresponding to a state of under- or over-arousal, respectively (Pattyn et al., 2008). Thus, in healthy populations two conditions appear necessary for the acute, transient emergence of fatigue: 1) high task demands or arousal in which, 2) the ability to exert effective control is challenged (Hockey, 2011). In this perspective, we describe a neurocomputational account of the subjective perception of fatigue (hereafter simply referred to as fatigue) that emerges in response to changing perceptions of control efficacy during demanding physical exertion, based on a predictive processing framework.Hierarchical Predictive Processing – A neurobiologically plausible theory of the brainUnder conceptualisations of predictive processing, the brain is formalised as a statistical organ that continuously seeks to render the external environment predictable. This is achieved through forming and testing predictions of generative models (i.e., models that explain how sensory inputs are generated probabilistically by latent states of the world) against incoming sensory evidence (Clark, 2013). By inverting generative models (i.e., computing the probability of the states of the world, given the sensory inputs), perception is described as a form of statistical inference achieved through minimizing the discrepancy (prediction error) between predictions (or perceptual hypotheses) and current sensory evidence (Stephan et al., 2016). Unlike traditional views of perception as a stimulus-response process, perception is instead highly ingrained and contextualised by our beliefs2 about the statistical nature of the world (Clark, 2015). In keeping with the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Knill & Pouget, 2004), models are cast as following an approximate form of Bayesian inference. This inferential process is implemented through predictive coding (Friston, 2005; Rao & Ballard, 1999). Together, multilevel cortical systems are proposed to transfer prediction and prediction error across a series of recurrent ‘loops,’ in which probabilistic predictions (or priors/beliefs) are passed top-down from higher to lower levels, while prediction errors (i.e., the unexplained data) travel laterally (within the same level) and ascend through forward projections to the level above and serve to update predictions (Fig. 1). This is equivalent to a belief update or the transformation of prior into posterior probabilities. In these models, the goal is to update beliefs at all levels of the hierarchy such that the discrepancy between predicted states and sensory inputs is minimal. Optimization of posterior probability therefore operates through the minimization of prediction error and enables perceptual inference, which across the multiple levels of the hierarchy can provide deep explanation of sensory data (Friston, 2009; Hohwy, 2014).
Fig. 1Neuronal architecture underpinning hierarchical predictive processing. The main figure on the right depicts a simple hierarchy that is assumed to incorporate a predictive coding encoding strategy. The system is split into five separate levels in which descending predictions (blue arrows) are transferred within the same level and to the level below. Our prior predictions are not always accurate—thus generating a prediction error. These computed prediction errors are represented by red arrows and are transferred within and between layers, ascending to the level above. The system is self-organising enabling the minimization of prediction error through updates to beliefs (i.e., posterior probability), which subsequently form new predictions passed on to the level below (i.e., empirical priors). This facilitates deep explanations of sensory inputs. Precision (i.e., inverse variance), akin to a measure of the signal-to-noise properties of an input, informs of the uncertainty or “confidence” placed in the sensory evidence. Precision determines the influence of prior beliefs relative to sensory inputs on prior updates. For example, the two depictions on the left of the figure illustrate how posterior distributions (black curves) of the value of a hidden state may be influenced by the relative precision of the prior (blue curves) and prediction error distributions (red curves). The width of the distributions indicates their variance, with precision the inverse of this variance. Precise prediction errors increase the influence of sensory evidence on updates to model predictions (i.e., posterior) (a). Conversely, when prediction errors are imprecise, they have little impact on the posterior belief (b). Precision must be estimated (second-order predictions; system not shown explicitly here) and is established by predictions descending from the highest level of the hierarchy (blue dashed line). The relative precision of prediction errors at every level of the system is believed to be controlled by neuromodulatory actions that gate or control the gain of error carrying neuronal units (grey arrows). Schematic adapted from combined works of: Ainley et al. (2016); Seth and Friston (2016)Prediction error may be minimized in two ways: 1) predictions may be updated to better explain sensory inputs (i.e., perceptual inference; described above); 2) sensory evidence that conforms to prior expectations may be selectively sampled through action. For example, within the motor system, motor commands are recast as a set of proprioceptive predictions concerning the sensory consequences of action, which are enacted through classical closed-loop reflexes enacted at lower levels of the hierarchy (Adams et al., 2013). Under the framework of active inference, perception and action are integrated functions of a coordinated process designed to minimize the experience of prediction error (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2016). Critically, understanding how perception and action emerge within predictive frameworks also requires a measure of the expected variability in the sensory data. Therefore, inferential computations must predict the sensory inputs (first-order predictions) and the reliability of this signal (second-order predictions) to make informed judgments on which to base perception and engage action (Kanai et al., 2015). The relative precision (i.e., inverse uncertainty; reflecting signal-to-noise, or more informally, confidence in the sensory signal) of prediction and prediction error determines their respective influence on posterior beliefs (Fig. 1a and b; see Friston, 2009). Predictions of high relative precision will dominate inferential processes (e.g., action), even in the presence of conflicting sensory evidence. Conversely, predictions of low precision afford greater weighting to sensory inputs which may force us to reevaluate and update model predictions (Friston, 2009, 2010). Attention has been proposed as a process of precision inference, through which estimates of precision may be optimized (Feldman & Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2012). Therefore attention, alongside action and perception, represents a natural component of error minimization within predictive processing. The estimation of expected precision within uncertain environments corresponds to higher-order beliefs concerning the reliability of sensory evidence (Fig. 1; Clark et al., 2018). Beliefs about beliefs (i.e., beliefs about estimated precision; hyperpriors) may provide a formalised description of metacognition (Friston et al., 2013). Within predictive processing, metacognition has been described as a high-level form of inference associated with the overall performance of prediction error minimization (Petzschner et al., 2017; Stephan et al., 2016)Inferred Dyshomeostasis – Allostasis, metacognition, and pathological fatigue.As well as inferring the ambiguous states of our external environment, our brains also must infer the cause of hidden states of the body (Seth & Critchley, 2013). Several accounts have applied predictive processing within the domain of interoception to explain how dynamically changing visceral, metabolic, autonomic, immunological, and hormonal conditions are integrated (Ainley et al., 2016; Barrett, 2017; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Gu et al., 2013; Seth et al., 2012; Seth & Critchley, 2013; Seth & Friston, 2016). All biological agents strive to maintain internal states within set bounds (homeostasis) and minimize the entropy of experienced sensory states (Friston, 2010). Interoceptive inference provides a potential explanation of how our brains respond to anticipated future needs of the body (allostasis; Sterling, 2012), and how those needs may be maintained across varying temporal scales; from (short-term) autonomic reflexes to (long-term) gross behavioural responses (Pezzulo et al., 2015). Allostasis and the representation of interoceptive consequences of action is a fundamental principle of all basic psychological functions (Kleckner et al., 2017), including our emotional experiences (Barrett, 2017; Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013) and the conscious appreciation and recognition of self (Apps & Tsakiris, 2014; Seth et al., 2012; Seth & Friston, 2016). For a more in-depth discussion on the formulations of homeostatic and allostatic function within current predictive processing frameworks, see Corcoran and Hohwy (2019).Increasingly, the (patho)aetiology of subjective feelings of fatigue have been attributed to altered computational inference, affecting the ability of hierarchical systems to reconcile sensorimotor/interoceptive predictions and sensory data (Clark et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2012; Kuppuswamy, 2017; Manjaly et al., 2019; Stephan et al., 2016; Wrightson et al., 2019). This may occur at several loci within the hierarchy (Petzschner et al., 2017; Stephan et al., 2016). For example, dysfunctional sensory receptors (Light et al., 2009) may increase prediction error even in the absence of overt perturbations, while unduly precise prior beliefs may generate flawed perceptual inferences that are impervious to prediction error updates (van der Schaaf et al., 2018). In respect of the latter, abnormal prior beliefs endowed with high precision through the misallocation of attentional resources have been proposed as the theoretical basis of many medically unexplained or “psychogenic” symptoms (Edwards et al., 2012). In this context, pathological symptoms of fatigue may potentially emerge as an indirect consequence of abnormal attentional processes (Edwards et al., 2012). However, it remains unclear exactly how the experience of fatigue would emerge exactly. Alternative accounts have described fatigue as a direct outcome of metacognitive processing (Stephan et al., 2016). Here, continued experience of (interoceptive) prediction error, despite engaging in corrective action, is monitored within a metacognitive layer and forges the belief that allostatic control processes are incapable of effectively minimizing interceptive prediction error (that is, one experiences low “allostatic control self-efficacy”), which is experienced subjectively as fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016).Stephan et al.'s (2016) compelling model provides a computational account of pathological fatigue, which the authors contend may be formally distinguished from the acute, transient exertional fatigue experienced in health (referred to by the authors as “tiredness”3). In this model, changes at a somatic level and/or within the hierarchical system’s circuitry in response to disease disrupts computational functions (which may involve various levels of the hierarchy) such that dyshomeostasis (error within the interoceptive model) is persistently experienced, engendering a perceived lack of control over bodily states which in turn fosters the conscious perception of fatigue. Importantly, in pathological fatigue, these disruptions affect the system in such a way that the detection of dyshomeostasis is not abated even through rest. Therefore, mastery over body states is not easily restored and the perception of fatigue endures. This is the fundamental difference between chronic, pathological experiences of fatigue and the acute feeling states incurred through physical activity. In the latter, prediction errors arising from metabolic responses to exercise can be effectively attenuated by action (i.e., rest), allowing the gradient of interoceptive “surprise” to turn negative and thus agency to be experienced through the restoration of homeostasis during a period of recovery.However, Stephan and colleague’s description of acute symptoms of fatigue does not explore the dynamics of the inference-control loop during the homeostatic challenges imposed by prolonged physical exertion (Gabriel & Zierath, 2017; Jeukendrup et al., 2000; Joyner & Coyle, 2008). Thus, an explicit account of how the acute, transient symptoms of fatigue emerge in relation to protracted physical exertion remains absent. Here, we conform to the proposition forwarded by Stephan et al. (2016)—that fatigue arises from the metacognitive detection of persistent prediction error which reduces perceived capability of exerting effective control over the body (reduced self-efficacy)—and extend the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis to describe the changing metacognitive beliefs and inferential computations that may underlie the development of exertional fatigue.Transient Exertional Fatigue - A predictive processing modelAccording to Stephan et al. (2016), pathological fatigue may initially reflect an adaptive process, promoting rest and the conservation of energetic resources when effective actions to restore homeostasis are not perceived to be present. We extend this, contending that the experience of fatigue serves a similar function during acute physical exertion, in line with previous assertions (St Clair Gibson & Noakes, 2004). The selection of (goal-directed) actions may be devolved to an inferential issue, whereby actions and their predicted outcomes are chosen for the agent to ultimately frequent predictable states long-term(Friston, 2009; Friston et al., 2014). Importantly, this may involve predicting the consequences of actions across different temporal scales and contexts (Pezzulo et al., 2018). In some instances, the active experience of uncertain states may be tolerated if it helps guide future behaviour towards the minimization of prediction error (e.g., exploitation versus exploration; Schwartenbeck et al., 2013). However, for goal-directed actions to be maintained, the precision of the driving high-level beliefs must be high in order to dominate posterior beliefs, maintain attention and enable action (Pezzulo et al., 2015). However, all physical behaviour involves energetic expenditure, providing an ever-changing homeostatic context which must also be predicted within the transition towards the said outcome. The integration of salient, motivational information (e.g., bodily states) informs inferential processes that influence the selection of control policies in the pursuit of goal states (Pezzulo et al., 2018). Accordingly, for action to continue in any given form, interoceptive prediction error (and effects on control circuits) must be suppressed. However, the act of doing so, through attentional processes4 or lower-level perceptual updates, indicates that initial predictions did not provide a good fit to the sensory data.The continued need to suppress prediction error in the pursuit of goals is the important extension of the proposal outlined by Stephan et al. (2016), forming the basis of metacognitive inference dynamics leading to the experience of fatigue emerging from acute (physical) exertion. We propose that the suppression of prediction error at all lower-﻿levels during the maintenance of goal-directed action driven by higher levels, is subject to the same metacognitive appraisal as described in the conceptualisation of pathological fatigue. Persistent experience of error within hierarchical models undermines (short-term) control mastery, reducing self-efficacy and is experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Metacognition within predictive processing may be ascribed computationally to beliefs about the precision of priors (Friston et al., 2013). The metacognitive experience of fatigue may therefore be associated with an increasing uncertainty in expected sensory states, reflecting low precision beliefs cascading down from high to low levels of the hierarchy. Low precision at higher, temporally-distal, and more abstract levels of prediction may be unable to contextualise prediction error effectively. Eventually over time, this decline in precision beliefs may be such that there is a shift in the dominant control of behaviour towards lower levels, which attempt to reconcile more immediate differences between predictions and prediction errors (Pezzulo et al., 2015; Fig. 2).
Fig. 2Predictive processing framework underlying the emergence of exertional fatigue. The engagement of protracted physical exertion requires internal models to accurately anticipate the sensory states that will be encountered to have the body reside within a (predictable) limited range of states that will sustain it biological integrity (i.e. maintain homeostasis). The subjective perception of fatigue may serve an adaptive function representing the ability of internal models to predict transition states during the pursuit of temporally distal goal states. (1) Under resting conditions or even low-intensity(physical) exertion, evidence of sensory states (green arrow) may be predictable (i.e., black posterior distribution dominated by blue prior beliefs). This may see the minimization of prediction error predominated by (autonomic) reflexes at the lowest level of the hierarchy. (2) However, as demands increase, and internal conditions becomes more unstable, physiological perturbations may be associated with greater prediction errors. Increasing strength of the prediction error (i.e., red distribution curve) may force error to ascend further up the levels of the hierarchy, necessitating deeper explanation, increasing its influence on posterior probabilities. This may generate attentional changes or perceptual updates across these lower levels. Yet importantly, as goal-directed action (i.e., physical exercise) is driven by higher-level beliefs, it may continue if the precision of these distal goal beliefs enables it to dominate prior updates and therefore contextualise the levels beneath (i.e., posterior distribution still dominated by prior beliefs). Estimation of the precision of beliefs is inferred in a separate stream (here simply represented by the grey circle). (3) Across time, the performance of the model’s overall prediction of the transition of states within goal pursuit is monitored by a metacognitive layer. Persistent detection of error within the hierarchy signals an inability to exert effective (allostatic) control of internal states during the pursuit of (longer term) goal states. This signals that the model may provide bad predictions about the present and, importantly, future condition(s) of the body. This perceived lack of control over bodily states undermines allostatic control self-efficacy, which is experienced as the subjective feeling of exertional fatigue. Computationally, the emergence of fatigue may be associated with declining precision estimates afforded to predictions driving goal-directed behaviour, signalling increasing uncertainty within the model and weakening the influence of priors on posterior beliefs (dashed blue line). The development of exertional fatigue is progressive, thus lower precision beliefs concerning goal-directed predictions result in greater prediction error throughout the levels of the hierarchy, which further undermine control capabilities during goal pursuit. Eventually, changing precision beliefs will see prediction error cause high-level, goal-directed beliefs to be updated (i.e., shift in posterior distribution towards prediction error) which may shift control priorities toward the resolution of more immediate prediction error. This may be achieved through action (i.e., rest). Over time, rest restores self-efficacy in ones' ability exert control over bodily states through the experience of agency (i.e., accurate predictions) in the restoration of homeostasis. Fatigue is therefore alleviated. However importantly, due to the significant challenge to model evidence encountered, restoration of perceived mastery of the body and homeostasis may be protracted. This is because precision estimates of predictions may be so low that prediction error is exacerbated during the recovery period. Therefore, the detection of accurate allostatic predictions may be strewn with prediction error which prolongs the subjective experience of fatigue. Red arrows represent ascending prediction error, blue arrows represent descending predictions and green arrows represent ascending sensory evidence from the body. Dashed blue line represents effects on precision estimatesTo illustrate this hypothesis, we provide an example based on the experience of fatigue during sustained physical exercise. Once the decision to engage with exercise has been made, the brain must predict not only the proprioceptive consequences of action, interactions with the social and physical environment, but also the homeostatic consequences of the transition towards the intended goal state, in order to maintain biological integrity. This is obviously challenging, since protracted whole-body exercise incurs a vast array of ever-changing processes across a range of biological systems (Hawley et al., 2014); the strength of which may exceed the control capable by simple reflexes at the lowest level and therefore competes for attention and higher-level control (Fig. 2). To continue towards goals (e.g. persist with the current exercise task), precise, high-level beliefs must be maintained. Action (i.e. reducing intensity) offers a means to minimize interoceptive prediction errors during goal pursuit but in certain instances this may directly challenge the probability of the expected or intended goal state being reached.Alternately, changes in attention and perceptual updates arising from prediction error minimization at lower levels may serve to enable goal-directed action to continue in a given form (e.g., speed). This may however, come at the expense of incurring further prediction error further on within a new inferential cycle. Regular and continued detection of error and the need for ensuing updates to maintain action increases evidence against initial model predictions and the capacity to effectively control the body’s states during exercise. As such, self-efficacy in ones' capacity to experience future goal states whilst controlling homeostatic integrity in this transition is undermined and experienced consciously as fatigue. Reduced confidence propagates, top-down, through the hierarchy, thus higher goal beliefs increasingly lose their ability to predict future outcomes and contextualise lower-level prediction errors. At this point, a shift to lower-level controllers may attempt to restore self-efficacy by minimizing the experience of prediction error on more immediate timescales (Pezzulo et al., 2015). That is, we are forced to slow down or stop altogether.Minimization of interoceptive prediction errors may not be immediate (e.g., replenishment of resting muscle glycogen stores can take many hours following exercise; Casey et al., 1995), therefore proprioceptive predictions5 may potentially be used as proxies for predicting the states which will eventually see interoceptive prediction error minimized (Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017; Pezzulo et al., 2018). By slowing down or stopping all together, the minimization of proprioceptive (and prospective interoceptive) prediction errors signals conditions that will see the restoration of homeostasis, indicating a level of control over bodily states which serves to alleviate fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016). However, the restoration of control self-efficacy is not immediate. Indeed, allostatic predictions used to maintain homeostatic set-points likely function across different biological systems under their own individual time constants (Stephan et al., 2016), which may see the experience of dyshomeostasis prolonged during rest. In addition, incurred deficits in allostatic self-efficacy and the subsequent decline in the precision afforded to control predictions (the proposed hallmark of fatigue) may underscore the protracted experience of fatigue post-exertion even when homeostatic balance has been restored. That is, increased sensitivity to prediction error during recovery (i.e., rest) may be maintained due to the loss of precision afforded to control predictions. It is possible that full alleviation of the conscious experience of fatigue may require the detection of a similar series of events to that through which it developed (i.e., protracted experience of accurate predictions related to interoceptive states). If this is the case, the experience of fatigue may urge us to stop in order to restore confidence in allostatic control beliefs and rest may represent the most effective context in which this may occur.Neuroanatomy of Interoceptive Monitoring During Physical Exertion – Neurophysiological evidenceThe neuroanatomical circuits supporting interoception and homeostasis have been extensively described (Craig, 2002, 2003; Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Damasio & Carvalho, 2013) and incorporated within models of interoceptive inference and allostatic control (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Gu et al., 2013; Stephan et al., 2016). Stephan et al. (2016) propose an additional metacognitive layer within established interoceptive pathways which monitors interoceptive prediction performance and is responsible for the emergence of fatigue. Putative structures include visceromotor regions, such as the anterior insula cortex (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)(Craig, 2002)and/or portions of the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)(Fleming & Dolan, 2012). In support of the former, the experience of fatigue has been shown to correlate with increased activity within visceromotor regions following an acute interoceptive (e.g., inflammation) challenge (Harrison et al., 2009, 2015). The dense connectivity of the AIC and ACC has seen them identified as part of the brain’s “rich-club,” enabling communication across diverse networks (e.g., default and salience) and facilitating the representation of the body and allostatic control as integral component of psychobehavioural functions (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Kleckner et al., 2017).Strikingly, studies of acute physical and cognitive exertion have identified a similar network involving the AIC, ACC, and portions of the dorsal lateral PFC (dlPFC), activated with demanding activity across both domains (see Müller & Apps, 2019 for summary). This network was implicated in the development of fatigue, assigned specifically with the monitoring of neural-responses within task-specific regions and the computation of the cost/benefits of continued action (Müller & Apps, 2019). Insula activity has also been shown to parallel increasing physiological demands in response to greater exercise intensities and durations (Williamson et al., 1999), with pronounced mid/AIC activation associated with the point of task failure (Hilty, Jäncke, et al., 2011a). Enhanced synchronisation of insula and primary motor cortex (M1) activity also has been observed toward the end of volitional exercise (Hilty, Langer, et al., 2011b), which may reflect the influence of the dynamically changing conditions of the body on selected control (action) policies. Indeed, one plausible hypothesis, similar to that proposed recently by McMorris et al. (2018), is that AIC is responsible for generating an awareness of the performance of interoceptive predictions and allostatic control during exercise, and therefore fatigue. The representation of allostatic control performance may be continuously influenced by inputs from the dlPFC, which may signal the level of uncertainty within (longer-term) predictions. The ACC is believed to play an important role in deciding between actions during physical exertion (Lutz, 2018) and thus may be involved in encoding the estimated precision of competing predictions and prediction errors based on inputs received regarding the performance of interoceptive predictions (see also Craig, 2009). Precision dynamics arbitrate between the dominant controllers within the hierarchy in pursuit of the suppression of (long-term) prediction error (Pezzulo et al., 2015), with the encoding of precision assigned to neuromodulatory systems (e.g., dopamine; Friston et al., 2012). It has been proposed that the development of exertional fatigue may coincide with changes in the firing of neuromodulatory neurons within the (lateral) PFC, modulating motivation and choice based on the integration of interoceptive and reward pathways (McMorris et al., 2018). The current proposal holds that changes in neuromodulatory control across various regions of the brain reflects the optimisation of precision across the hierarchy to minimize prediction error, and fatigue is associated with a progressive reduction in precision estimates of high-level predictions driving action.Testing the Model – Current empirical support and future hypothesesThe core proposition of the proposed model contends that detection of repeated prediction error within interoceptive circuits during acute bouts of physical exertion undermines control efficacy beliefs, reductions in which provide the foundation of the perception of fatigue. Several lines of evidence in the existing literature support these central assertions and provide the basis of future investigations.Multiple studies have investigated the association between self-efficacy, emotion (Focht et al., 2007; Magnan et al., 2013; McAuley et al., 1999), and behavioural responses to acute physical exertion (Halper & Vancouver, 2016; Hutchinson et al., 2008; McAuley & Courneya, 1992; Weinberg et al., 1981). Perceived capacity to successfully engage in further physical exertion has been demonstrated to both increase (Blacklock et al., 2010; Katula et al., 1999) and decrease (Focht et al., 2007; Katula et al., 1999; Welch et al., 2010) in response to acute bouts of exercise. The direction of this effect appears to be associated with the intensity of the bout (Blacklock et al., 2010; Katula et al., 1999). Deterioration in performance self-efficacy has been demonstrated at intensities at which a change in the metabolic environment is evident (Welch et al., 2010) and importantly, this decrement has been associated with the phenomenological experience of fatigue (Focht et al., 2007). These findings provide support for the proposition that physiological perturbations evoked by demanding physical exertion impact perceived efficacy which may be the origin for the acute, transient experience of exertional fatigue. However, future research is required to empirically establish whether unstable metabolic responses during exercise lead directly to a deterioration in self-efficacy and to confirm the temporal association between changes in perceived efficacy and the phenomenological experience of fatigue during physical exertion. Weakening of self-efficacy is proposed to evolve from continued metacognitive detection of prediction error (Stephan et al., 2016). Presently, few studies have directly examined the effect of physical exertion on metacognitive function (Palmer et al., 2019), despite recognition that it is a process fundamental to self-regulation during prolonged physical exertion (Brick et al., 2015; Brick et al., 2020; see Brick et al., 2016). Future examination of the metacognitive basis of exertional fatigue under the present proposal could see the use of a combination of metacognitive assessments alongside the modelling of precision estimates from behavioural responses (Hezemans et al., 2020; Wolpe et al., 2014). Interestingly, using this behavioural modelling approach, apathy—a construct often correlated with fatigue—has recently been associated with a low precision-weighting of performance predictions (Hezemans et al., 2020).It is unclear whether potential reductions in self-efficacy relate to confidence in one’s ability to control or accurately perceive viscerosensory information. Experimental manipulation of prediction error within interoceptive paradigms provides a suitable challenge. The exercise science literature is replete with experimental interventions designed to manipulate physical or perceived states during exercise, with a predominant focus on altering interoceptive-associated feedback (Amann et al., 2009; Castle et al., 2012; Hartman et al., 2019; Iodice et al., 2019). However, it is important to note for future investigations that under the current framework, perception is understood only when descending beliefs and ascending sensory evidence are considered in conjunction. To highlight this point, recent evidence demonstrated that perception of a weak, exteroceptive stimulus was influenced by its relative timing within the cardiac cycle with effects of presumed heartbeat-event predictions observed throughout the somatosensory cortex (Al et al., 2020). It is expected that interoceptive self-efficacy will be most impaired when the divergence between expectations and physiological states is at its greatest.In healthy populations, sustained contractions are perceived as more effortful when performed in a perceived state of fatigue, even in condition absent of any functional changes to the active muscles (Greenhouse-Tucknott et al., 2020). Similarly, effort perception during motor tasks has been associated with trait fatigue in clinical populations, such as stroke survivors, suffering from chronic fatigue (De Doncker et al., 2020)6. This may be explained within the proposed model as follows: lower precision estimates in prior beliefs at higher levels emerging with (exertional) fatigue (reflecting increasing uncertainty in model predictions) cause greater prediction error at lower levels. Perception of effort is associated with movement or action costs, reflecting high gain, or insufficient attenuation, of action-induced prediction error (Kuppuswamy, 2017), or more formally described under information theoretical principles, as the information cost of updating prior beliefs (Zénon et al., 2019). Therefore, the decline in precision estimates associated with fatigue form greater prediction error that generates a heightened perception of effort. What is not currently clear is whether, in healthy populations, the magnitude of fatigue experienced by an individual is directly proportional to the perceived effort during action. Further examination of the effect of increasing severity of fatigue on the perception of effort and the regulation of motor performance are warranted.It is recognised that assessment of an individual’s interoceptive ability can span various dimensions, including the accuracy of one’s interoceptive judgments, self-reported confidence in those judgements and also insight into those judgements, i.e., metacognitive evaluation of the correspondence between objective accuracy and confidence in the accuracy of those judgements (Garfinkel et al., 2015; Garfinkel & Critchley, 2013; see also Khalsa et al., 2018). Despite its clear relevance to exertional fatigue and performance fatigability (McMorris et al., 2018; Robertson & Marino, 2016), studies on the effect of individuals’ (conscious and nonconscious) awareness of physiological states on perception and performance during physical exertion are sparse, conflicting and presently limited to measures of interoceptive accuracy (da Silva Machado et al., 2019; Herbert et al., 2007; Köteles et al., 2020). How an individual’s insight into representations of interoceptive signals influences acute physical exertion and the development of fatigue is currently unknown. Although yet to be empirically tested, it is possible that an individual’s interoceptive insight may change the relationship between a perceived state of fatigue and other perceptions arising from prediction error, such as the perception of effort, during physical exertion. That is, those who are more aware of the accuracy of their interoceptive judgments may experience smaller, relative reductions in precision beliefs under conditions of fatigue, therefore attenuating the rise in prediction error and the perception of effort. In line with this hypothesis, interoceptive insight has been shown to reduce one’s susceptibility to an exteroceptive manipulation of self-location (Bekrater-Bodmann et al., 2020), suggesting that precise higher-order representations of the body are effective at limiting the influence of (exteroceptive) prediction error on belief updates. Evaluation of how conscious insight into interoceptive representations of bodily shapes this relationship may help further define how metacognitive processes influence subjective experiences aroused during acute fatiguing exertion.The neuroanatomical circuits supporting the development of pathological fatigue based on metacognitive detection of persistent interoceptive prediction-error have been proposed (see Stephan et al., 2016; “Neuroanatomy of interoceptive monitoring during physical exertion – neurophysiological evidence ” section). Functional resting-state connectivity and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) provides a potential means of establishing interactions between the nodes within this metacognitive interoception-network in response to fatigue (Stephan et al., 2016). Similar methods have recently been used to quantify changes in effective connectivity with the development of fatigue during protracted cognitive tasks (Wylie et al., 2020) and have indicated abnormal inhibition between hemispheres as a factor in the development of persistent fatigue in people with stroke (Ondobaka et al., 2019). In the context of the present model, it may be expected that an increased connectivity between visceromotor and prefrontal regions of the putative interoceptive metacognition network and primary interoceptive cortex (posterior insula cortex) (Barrett & Simmons, 2015) occurs as participants monitor the presence of dyshomeostasis during physical exertion. However, whether changes in effective connectivity between key nodes is associated with the development of exertional fatigue has yet to be elucidated.Concluding RemarksIn this perspective article, we draw upon recent propositions for the computational basis of pathological fatigue and extend this framework to provide an account of the subjective experience of fatigue evoked through acute exertion. Fundamentally, whether developing in response to pathology or as an acute, transient state during physical exertion, the experience of fatigue is a product of inference associated with an increased uncertainty in one’s capacity to accurately predict and control sensory states. This framework is fundamentally entrenched within current conceptualisations of how the brain works. We hope that with this article we have highlighted and indeed emphasised the potential of predictive processing to provide a common framework for the study of fatigue across health and disease.1As described by Kuppuswamy (2017), if fatigue is the product of inference it is unitary and thus the common separation of fatigue between physical and cognitive domains may be unnecessary. Accordingly, the same principles described here in the explanation of fatigue emerging through physical exertion may also account for fatigue symptoms incurred through prolonged, demanding cognitive activity, although the exact locus of the disturbance (i.e., the level within the hierarchical system) and the specific systems (e.g., interoception vs. control) monitored may vary between domains (Müller & Apps, 2019).2The probabilistic representation of the causes of sensory data before observing the data.3We do not subscribe to the adopted terminology used by Stephan et al. (2016) in the description of feelings associated with chronic (i.e., fatigue) and acute (i.e., tiredness) experiences. Feelings of “tiredness” may be particularly problematic in the description of fatigue, because it also is used to describe a subjective state of sleepiness (Pigeon et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2006). Thus, tiredness may not accurately depict the subjective experiences reported after exertion (Leproult et al., 1997; Matsumoto et al., 2002). In response to demanding physical exertion, fatigue is a fundamental subjective experience.4We acknowledge the current understanding of volitional control of endogenous attention within predictive coding frameworks is not entirely clear (Metzinger, 2017).5An extension of the metacognitive theory of dyshomeostasis (Manjaly et al., 2019) proposes that metacognitive monitoring may not be exclusive to interoceptive circuits and may involve the detection a chronic mismatch between prediction and actual sensory evidence across different systems (e.g., proprioception; exteroception). In addition, interdependency between systems (Pezzulo et al., 2018) may see the persistent detection of error and development of fatigue permeate across different systems.6The authors propose that the experience of a high perception of effort drives the (trait) perception of fatigue in stroke survivors, rather than (state) fatigue driving elevated perceptions of effort (De Doncker et al., 2020). The model presented here suggests that the relationship between fatigue and effort may be circular; error is the basis of the perception of effort, which if persistently detected generates a feeling of fatigue. Changing precision beliefs associated with fatigue gives rise to greater error, which in turn elevates the perception of effort.Publisher’s noteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.The authors extend sincere thanks to Dr. Paul Ansdell for his constructive and insightful comments during the preparation of this manuscript.

In this study, we describe autoantibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) in patients with schizophrenia (5.4%, cell-based assay; 6.7%, ELISA) in a Japanese cohort (n = 223). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody disrupts both NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interactions. Furthermore, the anti-NCAM1 antibody purified from patients with schizophrenia interrupts NCAM1-Fyn interaction and inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and ERK1 when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice and also reduces the number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex. In addition, it induces schizophrenia-related behavior in mice, including deficient pre-pulse inhibition and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice. These antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target and serve as a biomarker to distinguish a small but treatable subgroup in heterogeneous patients with schizophrenia.Graphical abstractHighlights•Some patients with schizophrenia are positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies•Anti-NCAM1 antibody from schizophrenia patients inhibits NCAM1-NCAM1 interactions•Anti-NCAM1 antibody from schizophrenia patients reduces spines and synapses in mice•Anti-NCAM1 antibody from patients induces schizophrenia-related behavior in miceShiwaku et al. show that autoantibodies against NCAM1 from schizophrenia patients cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in spines and synapses in mice. These autoantibodies may cause symptoms of schizophrenia and can therefore be regarded as a therapeutic target for patients who are positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies.KeywordsschizophreniaNCAM1anti-NCAM1 autoantibodyimmunopsychiatryPublished: April 19, 2022IntroductionPatients with schizophrenia are symptomatically and genetically heterogeneous, and it is assumed that there are various underlying pathological mechanisms.1 However, there are no biomarkers for these heterozygous subgroups, and elucidation of pathological mechanisms underlying treatment resistance in patients and/or symptoms is insufficient.Genetic analysis of schizophrenia has revealed risk genes related to synapse, chromatin modification, and the immune system.2, 3, 4 In particular, mutations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region carry the highest risk of schizophrenia.2 The MHC region also plays a role in autoimmunity. In fact, there is an epidemiological relationship between schizophrenia and autoimmunity;5 however, the role of autoimmune responses in schizophrenia remains unclear.Autoantibodies are a primary driver of autoimmunity. Indeed, autoantibodies specific for synaptic membrane molecules have been found in patients with encephalitis.6,7 Some autoantibodies specific for these molecules cause psychotic symptoms in those with encephalitis. One of the most extensively studied autoantibody-mediated forms of encephalitis is anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody encephalitis, which is associated with schizophrenia-related symptoms.8 In addition, anti-GABAARα1 receptor antibody encephalitis causes psychotic symptoms.9 Although these autoantibodies are also present in patients with schizophrenia, it is unclear whether they play a role in the symptoms of schizophrenia.10,11When searching for autoantibodies related to the pathology of schizophrenia, there are several prerequisites: the target antigen must be (1) a membrane molecule expressed in the nervous system (autoantibodies do not usually enter cells in vivo) and (2) a molecule implicated in schizophrenia and whose function would be affected by autoantibodies or at least be involved in synaptic function. From this point of view, we used a cell-based assay and ELISA to identify novel autoantibodies that may contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology. One candidate antigen was neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1), a synaptic adhesion molecule that supports synaptic connections by trans-homophilic binding.12 NCAM1 also binds to glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and contributes to synapse formation.12,13 Various studies have been conducted on NCAM1 and schizophrenia; changes in mRNA expression levels and the cleaved soluble form of NCAM1 are associated with schizophrenia.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Furthermore, NCAM1 knockout and transgenic mice with a dominant-negative form of NCAM1 show schizophrenia-related behavioral changes.20, 21, 22, 23 Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NCAM1 are associated with schizophrenia.24, 25, 26In this study, we identified anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in some patients with schizophrenia. Using a disease model in which mice were administered immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from patients with schizophrenia, we show that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies inhibit spine and synapse formation in the frontal cortex and induce schizophrenia-related behavior.ResultsIdentification of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients with schizophreniaSerum samples were obtained from 201 healthy controls (125 males and 76 females; age, 22–90 years; median, 48 years) and 223 patients with schizophrenia (112 males and 111 females; age, 16–84 years; median, 52 years). Schizophrenia was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age. All samples were tested using the ELISA and the cell-based assay. The ELISA analysis detected 15 patients with schizophrenia as positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies, where two standard deviations above the mean of absorbance was defined as positive for this autoantibody (Figure 1A). None of the healthy control subjects was positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in the ELISA. The antibody titers of patients with schizophrenia were significantly high compared with those in healthy controls (Figure 1A). In the cell-based assay using HeLa cells, human NCAM1 and EGFP were expressed from a plasmid, and all transfected cells expressing EGFP showed exogenous expression of NCAM1 (Figures 1B and S1A). Twelve patients with schizophrenia (5.4%) were positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B; Table 1). To test whether these patients also have other autoantibodies against other synaptic molecules, we induced the expression of NLGN1, NLGN2, NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, NRXN3, ephrin B1–B3, ERBB4, NRG1, NR1, NR2, and GABAARα1 in the same cell-based assay approach. However, we found no autoantibodies against these molecules in these 12 schizophrenia patients with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies (data not shown). Among these 12 patients, 11 patients with schizophrenia were detected as being positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibody by both ELISA and cell-based assay. Two healthy controls (a male; age, 26; antibody titer, 1:30; and a female with a past medical history of breast cancer; age, 46; antibody titer, 1:100) were positive for anti-NCAM1 antibodies (1.0%) in the cell-based assay. The antibody titers of patients with schizophrenia were significantly high compared with those in healthy controls (i.e., 1:1,000–10,000; Figure 1C). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies were also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in anti-NCAM1 autoantibody-positive patients with schizophrenia (Figures 1B and S1C; Table 1). Protein concentration and leukocyte numbers of CSF in these patients were normal.Figure 1Identification of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies(A) Titers of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in serum by ELISA. ∗∗p < 0.01 (n = 201, healthy controls; n = 223, patients with schizophrenia; Mann-Whitney U test).(B) Immunocytochemistry using a commercial anti-NCAM1 antibody, serum and CSF from schizophrenia patient 1, and serum from healthy controls.

Similar results were obtained for all anti-NCAM1 antibody-positive patients with schizophrenia (Figure S1B).

NCAM1 is a cell adhesion molecule in the synapse with a transmembrane region.12,18 The extracellular region of NCAM1 is cleaved by ADAM10 and ADAM17,27,28 and a small amount of its soluble form has been found in serum. Because changes in soluble NCAM1 have been reported in patients with schizophrenia,16,17,19 we tested whether autoantibodies against NCAM1 affect the soluble form of NCAM1 in serum. We performed ELISAs to analyze soluble NCAM1 in serum and found that soluble NCAM1 is significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia (Figure 1D). Furthermore, soluble NCAM1 in serum was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies detected by the cell-based assay compared with patients without anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies (Figure 1E). It is also noted that the concentration of serum-soluble NCAM in anti-NCAM1 autoantibody-negative patients with schizophrenia was still significantly lower than those of healthy controls (Figure 1F). Although these results indicate an association between anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies and soluble NCAM, scatterplot analysis of NCAM1 titers by ELISA and concentrations of soluble NCAM did not show a significant relationship (Figure S1E). Therefore, the consequences of the immune complex may be more complicated than anticipated.The clinical features of the 12 patients with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies detected by cell-based assay are described in Table 1. There were no distinct psychiatric or neurological symptoms, including delirium and encephalitis, in these patients compared with other patients. Furthermore, there was no common past medical history, such as cancer or autoimmune disease, shared among the patients. However, psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions in these patients, were refractory to antipsychotics. The medications administered to these patients are listed in Table S1.The main epitope recognized by anti-NCAM1 antibodies in schizophrenia resides within the Ig1 domainTo identify the epitope recognized by the anti-NCAM1 autoantibody, we constructed truncated forms of NCAM1 (Figure 2A). The extracellular region of NCAM1 comprises five N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1–Ig5) and two fibronectin type III domains (FN3). The cell-based assay revealed that serum from 12 patients with schizophrenia reacted with the truncated forms of ΔIg2 and ΔIg2–5, which lack the Ig2 domain and Ig2–5 domains, respectively; however, they did not react with those of ΔIg1 and ΔIg1–5, which lack the Ig1 domain and Ig1–5 domains, respectively (Figures 2B and 2C). These binding patterns were confirmed by western blotting (Figure 2D). These data indicate that the main epitope region resides within the Ig1 domain.Figure 2The main epitope recognized by anti-NCAM1 antibodies in schizophrenia resides within the Ig1 domain(A) NCAM1 deletion constructs.(B) Immunocytochemistry using serum from patient 1 with schizophrenia, who was positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies. NCAM1 deletion constructs and EGFP were expressed from a plasmid. Similar results were obtained from all anti-NCAM1 antibody-positive patients with schizophrenia. Scale bar: 10 μm.(C) Immunocytochemical confirmation of the expression of NCAM1ΔIg1 and NCAM1ΔIg1–5 using a commercial anti-NCAM1 antibody. Scale bar: 10 μm.(D) Western blot analysis of deletion constructs of NCAM1 transfected into HeLa cells revealed that the main epitope recognized by anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies is in the Ig1 domain.The polysialylated form of NCAM1 (PSA-NCAM) is abundant during developmental stages in the nervous system and is associated with cell migration and axonal growth.29 Polysialylation occurs on the Ig5 domain of NCAM1.30,31 Thus, we hypothesized that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies also detect PSA-NCAM. Western blot analysis using the cortex of postnatal day 0 mice revealed that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies detect both NCAM1 and PSA-NCAM (Figure S2A).There are about 500 molecules that contain Ig domains.32 Therefore, we analyze whether anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies cross-react with other molecules that contain Ig domains, such as NCAM2, L1CAM, and TAG1. The cell-based assay revealed that none of the anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in 12 patients identified by the cell-based assay react with these molecules (Figures S3B–S3D). These results suggest that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies react with an NCAM1-specific sequence.Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies disrupt NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactionsNCAM1 forms synapses through homophilic binding via immunoglobulin domains, including the Ig1 domain.12,33 In addition, GDNF promotes development of spines through binding to NCAM1.13,34 Thus, we hypothesized that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies would inhibit NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions. A pull-down assay showed that IgG purified from schizophrenia patient 1 inhibited NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions, whereas IgG purified from healthy controls did not (Figures 3A and 3B). A pull-down assay showed that IgG purified from schizophrenia patients 2 and 3 also inhibited NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions (Figures S3A and S3B).Figure 3Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies disrupt NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions(A) Pull-down assay confirming that IgG purified from a patient with schizophrenia who was positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies disrupts NCAM1-NCAM1 interactions. His-tagged proteins were pulled down by Ni-NTA-agarose, and GST-tagged proteins were pulled down by Glutathione Sepharose.(B) Pull-down assay showing that IgG purified from a patient with schizophrenia who was anti-NCAM1 autoantibody-positive disrupts the NCAM1-GDNF interaction. His-tagged proteins were pulled down by Ni-NTA-agarose, and GST-tagged proteins were pulled down by Glutathione Sepharose.Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from a patient with schizophrenia inhibited NCAM1-Fyn-FAK-MEK1-ERK1 pathway in miceIf anti-NCAM1 antibodies found in patients with schizophrenia inhibit NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions, we assumed that they would also cause abnormal molecular signaling, abnormal spine and synapse formation, and schizophrenia-related behavior in mice. To test this, IgG was purified from a patient with schizophrenia (patient 1) and an age- and sex-matched healthy subject and then injected into the CSF of mice (8 weeks of age). We then analyzed molecular signaling, spine and synapse formation, and behavior of mice at 9 weeks of age (Figure 4A). We confirmed that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia reacted with NCAM1 expressed by primary cultured neurons (Figure S4A) and in the frontal cortex of mice (Figure S4B). Previous studies report that antibodies administered to mice against specific antigens within the nervous system stay in the brain for more than a week.35,36 However, non-specific IgGs injected into the CSF transferred to serum within a day.37 Consistent with these reports, our immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that intrathecal administration of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia were still present in mice at 9 weeks of age (Figure S8B). There was no evidence of microglial activation or encephalitis (Figures S5A and S5B).Figure 4Injection of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from a patient with schizophrenia into mice(A) Experimental protocol for IgG injection. AAV1-SYN1-EGFP and AAV2-VAMP2-mCherry were injected into the frontal cortex of mice aged 6 weeks, and purified IgG was injected into the CSF of mice aged 8 weeks.

Using mice administered with IgG purified from patient 1 and immunoprecipitation assay, we analyzed the amount of Fyn coimmunoprecipitated with NCAM1. This revealed NCAM1-Fyn interaction is reduced in mice administered with IgG purified from patient 1 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, IgG purified from patient 1 with schizophrenia inhibited phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and ERK1, whereas IgG purified from a healthy subject did not (Figures 4C and 4D). These results indicate that inhibition of NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions by anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies impairs the interaction of NCAM1-Fyn and reduces phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and ERK1.Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from a patient with schizophrenia reduced the number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex in miceInhibiting phosphorylation of FAK, ERK1, and MEK1 and interrupting trans-homophilic NCAM1 interactions between the pre- and post-synapse, a process that maintains synapses,12 indicates that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies cause changes in spines and synapses. To examine this, we performed two-photon analysis of mice that received patient IgG intrathecally. Neurites and spines were visualized using adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1)-EGFP, driven by the synapsin I promoter (AAV1-SYN-EGFP); axon terminals in contact with a spine were visualized using AAV2-VAMP2-mCherry (Figure 4A). As expected, mice treated with IgG from patient 1 with schizophrenia showed reduced spines and synapses in the frontal cortex; these changes were not seen in mice receiving IgG from a healthy subject (Figures 4E, 4F, and S6).Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from a patient with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior in miceTo test whether anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies trigger symptoms of schizophrenia, we performed behavioral analysis of autoantibody-treated mice. Administration of IgG purified from patient 1 with schizophrenia reduced cognitive function in the Y maze test (Figure 4G; Videos S1 and S2). Moreover, mice treated with IgG from a patient with schizophrenia were deficient in pre-pulse inhibition (Figure 4H), which is an established endophenotype of schizophrenia.39, 40, 41, 42 Mice treated with IgG from a healthy subject showed normal pre-pulse inhibition. Mice receiving IgG from patient 1 with schizophrenia showed no abnormal locomotor activity, anxiety behavior, or social interaction in an open-field test, an elevated plus maze test, or a three-chamber test, respectively (Figures S7A–S7H).Video S1. Y maze test, control IgG, related to Figure 4GVideo S2. Y maze test, schizophrenia NCAM IgG, related to Figure 4GAbsorption and removal of anti-NCAM1 antibodies improved the molecular, spinal, and behavioral changesTo confirm that it was the anti-NCAM1 antibodies among IgGs purified from patient 1 that inhibited phosphorylation, reduced the number of spines and synapses, and induced schizophrenia-related behavior in mice, we performed an absorption experiment in which anti-NCAM1 antibodies were removed from IgGs purified from patient 1 with schizophrenia prior to administration to mice (absorbed Sz IgG). Adsorption and removal of anti-NCAM1 antibodies by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down were confirmed in a cell-based assay and by immunohistochemistry (Figures S8A and S8B). Phosphorylation, spines and synapses, and behavior improved after the absorption experiment (Figures 4B–4H). These results confirm that anti-NCAM1 antibodies from patient 1 alter phosphorylation and induce synaptic changes and schizophrenia-related behavior in mice.Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in miceFinally, to confirm that the results from schizophrenia patient 1 could be observed in other patients who are positive for anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies, we conducted two-photon analysis and behavioral analysis using IgG purified from schizophrenia patients 2 and 3 (Figure 5A). IgG from these patients also reduced spine and synapse numbers in the frontal cortex, as well as inducing cognitive impairment and a deficiency in pre-pulse inhibition (Figures 5B–5E).Figure 5Anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapse numbers in mice(A) Experimental protocol for IgG injection.

Administration of IgG antibodies isolated from patients with schizophrenia interrupted NCAM1-NCAM1 and NCAM1-GDNF interactions. These interruptions affect the NCAM1-Fyn-FAK-MEK1-ERK1 signaling pathway and inhibited NCAM1-Fyn interactions as well as the phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and ERK1. Furthermore, direct administration of anti-NCAM1 antibodies into the CSF of mice reduced the number of spines and synapses in the frontal cortex and induced cognitive impairment and a deficiency in pre-pulse inhibition, which is an established endophenotype of schizophrenia in humans and mice.41, 42, 43 Indeed, cognitive impairment and deficiency in pre-pulse inhibition are reported in multiple mice models of schizophrenia, such as the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome mouse model, DISC1-knockout (KO) mice, and Setd1a-KO mice.44, 45, 46 A reduction in the number of spines and synapses has also been reported in patients with schizophrenia as well as mice models of schizophrenia.47, 48, 49, 50These behavioral and synaptic changes are also found in NCAM1 KO mice and transgenic mice with a dominant negative form of NCAM1.20, 21, 22, 23 Furthermore, SNPs of NCAM1 and schizophrenia are repeatedly reported.24, 25, 26 The reports that SNPs of NCAM1 or the expression level of soluble NCAM1 are associated with cognitive impairment of patients with schizophrenia may relate to our analysis of cognitive impairment in mice administered with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia.16,26 NCAM1-Fyn-FAK pathway, which is disturbed both in NCAM1 mutant mice and by anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies, regulates the development of not only excitatory synapses but also GABAergic synapses.51 Transgenic mice with a dominant negative form of NCAM1 show a reduction of PV and GAD65/67, markers for GABAergic neurons.52 These reductions of GABAergic neurons and disturbances of the GABA system are observed in patients with schizophrenia.53, 54, 55, 56 The data presented herein, together with previous reports, indicate that dysfunction of NCAM1 by genetic or anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies is associated with schizophrenia.However, if anti-NCAM1 antibodies are generated postnatally, while genetic mutation of NCAM1 affects neural development from the embryonic stage, it is uncertain whether postnatal inhibition of NCAM1 by anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies can induce changes comparable to those in NCAM mutant mice. Furthermore, there is a possibility that a single type of NCAM1 dysfunction will not trigger the onset of schizophrenia, as is often the case for polygenic disorders.One of the explanations for this is that anti-NCAM1 antibodies may have pathogenic properties other than inducing dysfunction in NCAM1. For example, targeting of synapses by autoantibodies may result in microglial synaptic pruning, even if the autoantibodies do not provoke an inflammatory response in the microglia. Such synaptic pruning has been reported during development, although it is not known how such targeted pruning is regulated.57,58 During normal development, synaptic pruning usually stops during adolescence, whereas progression of synaptic pruning after adolescence is hypothesized for schizophrenia.59 Autoantibodies against synaptic molecules, including NCAM1, may be involved in such progressive synaptic punning by acting as a target marker for microglia. These themes will be tested in the future to examine hypotheses that autoantibodies specific for synaptic molecules, such as NCAM1, have an impact beyond dysfunction of an antigen molecule.In addition, anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies may cross-react with other molecules. Such cross-reactivity is observed in other autoantibodies, such as anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and anti-GABA receptor autoantibodies.60,61 In our analysis, we could not find the cross-reactivity to other representative molecules containing Ig domains and other synaptic molecules. However, identifying such other cross-reactive antigens may also explain the broad pathogenic features of anti-NCAM1 autoantibody. Moreover, there is also a possibility that patients with schizophrenia with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies have other autoantibodies against synaptic molecules. Although our patients with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies were negative for autoantibodies against other tested representative synaptic molecules and absorption experiments with recombinant NCAM1 restored the phenotypes observed in mice administered with IgGs purified from patients with schizophrenia, this does not entirely dismiss the existence of other autoantibodies. Therefore, future experiments with highly purified anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia would be ideal to reveal the specific effect of this autoantibody. Identifying cross-reactive antigens and co-existing autoantibodies is an effective way to reveal complete pictures of autoantibody pathologies in autoantibody-positive patients.Although expression of NCAM1 protein was very high in the brain, there was very weak systemic expression in the heart and spleen (Figure S1C). However, there was no obvious systemic inflammation or damage in these organs in patients who were positive for anti-NCAM1 antibodies. One reason for the absence of inflammation may be differences in NCAM1 expression levels in these tissues. Furthermore, there are no reports of phenotypes other than that in the brain of KO mice.23 This is also consistent with the absence of damage or dysfunction in organs other than the brain in patients who are positive for anti-NCAM1 antibodies. However, it should be borne in mind that systemic inflammation in these organs is theoretically possible.Similarly, we found that patients with anti-NCAM1 antibodies in the CSF did not develop encephalitis in our study; however, encephalitis is possible theoretically when antibody titers in the CSF increase further. In fact, there are clinical and literature cases in which autoantibodies cause psychiatric symptoms or epilepsy without causing encephalitis; these conditions are improved by plasma exchange.9,62 Conversely, it is possible that some idiopathic cases of encephalitis are caused by anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies. In our study, the administration of purified and diluted IgGs from patients 2 and 3 into the CSF of mice was sufficient to induce a similar abnormality of spines, synapses, and behaviors to those that manifested from the administration of IgG from patient 1. This may indicate that this concentration is sufficient to induce psychiatric symptoms. Conversely, we also observed generalized slowing of the basic rhythm on electroencephalogram (EEG) with theta activity in patient 1 (Table 1). This supports the hypothesis that an increase of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in the CSF can affect an EEG and further increase can contribute to encephalitis. These theories will be explored in future studies.We screened anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies with both an ELISA and cell-based assay. ELISA is highly quantitative, while the cell-based assay has the advantage of analyzing more physiological molecular structures. Since NCAM1 is a cell membrane molecule, positive signal by anti-NCAM1 autoantibody is easy to distinguish from non-specific staining within the cell-based assay. Therefore, this assay seems to have high specificity. Differences in the results between the ELISA and cell-based assay may indicate a variation of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies. Determining the significance of each property of autoantibodies will be necessary for the clinical utility of these analyses.Soluble NCAM is cleaved from extracellular NCAM and presents an epitope for the anti-NCAM1 autoantibody.18 The immune complex of anti-NCAM1 autoantibody-soluble NCAM may be a target for degradation. In fact, the concentration of soluble NCAM in the blood was significantly decreased in patients with schizophrenia with anti-NCAM1 autoantibody detected by the cell-based assay (Figure 1E). Although anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies did not cause apparent systemic or neuronal inflammation in our patients, chronic low-grade inflammation has been reported in schizophrenia.63,64 Interaction between anti-NCAM autoantibody and serum-soluble NCAM or peripheral NCAM1 can theoretically cause such chronic inflammation. However, our results suggest that there are factors other than anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies that contribute to the decrease in serum-soluble NCAM in patients with schizophrenia. This is due to the finding that the concentration of serum-soluble NCAM in schizophrenia patients without anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies was lower than that in healthy subjects (Figure 1F). Although these data suggest a relationship between anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies and the concentration of serum-soluble NCAM, the consequences of the immune complex may not be that simple. Indeed, a scatterplot analysis of NCAM1 titer by ELISA and concentration of soluble NCAM did not show a significant relationship. The consequences of the immune complex may be widespread. For example, the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-autoantibody complex inhibits the degradation of dsDNA in serum, and dsDNA increases when anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are increased.65 Thus, interpretation of the relationship between anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies and serum-soluble NCAM may be intricate, owing to the possible variations of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies and other unknown factors that affect serum-soluble NCAM.In our study, there were two healthy subjects with low titers of anti-NCAM1 antibody. There are several interpretations regarding autoantibodies in healthy individuals. Various autoantibodies have been reported in healthy subjects, such as anti-NMDA receptor antibody, anti-CASPR2 antibody, and anti-amphiphysin antibody, which have all been established as causes of encephalitis.66,67 Whether these autoantibodies lead to the onset of neurological or psychiatric symptoms depends on their antibody titer and whether the autoantibodies reach the nervous system through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Autoantibody penetration across the BBB is a complex matter involving genetic and other factors.68,69 In fact, BBB vulnerability is reported in patients with schizophrenia.68,70,71 Thus, antibody titer or BBB vulnerability may be insufficient for onset of psychotic symptoms in these two healthy subjects. At the same time, they may be at a risk of developing psychotic symptoms or encephalitis if their antibody titer and BBB vulnerability increase in the future.To more accurately determine the prevalence of anti-NCAM1 antibody in patients with schizophrenia, the analysis of a larger cohort involving several thousands of patients is necessary, although many autoantibodies have been discovered in cohorts of approximately 100 patients.72, 73, 74, 75 Examples of such autoantibodies include autoantibodies against LGI1, CASPR2, GABAARα1, and NRXN3, which have been established as causes of encephalitis.72, 73, 74, 75 Similarly, we discovered anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in a cohort of 223 patients with schizophrenia. The main theme of this study is the discovery of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies and the elucidation of their pathological significance. An analysis of cohorts of thousands of patients, which has been conducted for some other autoantibodies after their discoveries,66 is anticipated in the future. Nevertheless, the analysis involving 100–200 patients and healthy subjects is also valuable, and analyses of autoantibodies in smaller cohorts of such a size have been published.67,76 Meta-analysis of these data will also establish a more accurate prevalence rate in the future.An identification of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies is important, because these autoantibodies can serve as biomarkers that distinguish a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia; also, immunological interventions such as plasma exchange and immunoglobulin therapy, which are usually used to treat autoantibody encephalitis, may work in this subgroup. A clinical study testing whether anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies play a role in schizophrenia would show that interventions improve the symptoms of schizophrenia.Why and how anti-NCAM1 antibodies are produced in some patients with schizophrenia is a topic for future research. The anti-NCAM1-antibodies-positive patients examined herein had no common past medical history, such as cancer or autoimmune disease. Analysis of the MHC gene region may be one possible approach to clarifying the mechanism underlying generation of anti-NCAM1 antibodies.In conclusion, we identified anti-NCAM1 antibodies in a small subgroup of patients with schizophrenia. These antibodies cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice. Further clinical studies are necessary to confirm the pathological significance of these antibodies in schizophrenia.Limitations of the studyDespite the elucidation that anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia cause synaptic changes and schizophrenia-related behaviors in mice, this study has not shown whether anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies relate to symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. To examine this question, it is necessary to conduct clinical studies to remove anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies from patients with schizophrenia by plasma exchange or immunological interventions and then assess the improvement of symptoms. Moreover, another limitation is that the mouse model used in this study is a relatively acute model involving single injection of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies. To clarify the effects of exposure to autoantibodies on the nervous system over a long period of time, which better reflects the case of schizophrenia, a model involving chronic injection is needed. Furthermore, this study does not highlight the duration of NCAM1 antibodies in patients with schizophrenia, which relates to whether NCAM1 antibodies are involved in the onset of schizophrenia. Thus, it is critical to epidemiologically analyze whether NCAM1 antibodies are present before the onset of schizophrenia and whether NCAM1-antibody-positive adolescents are at higher risk of developing schizophrenia.STAR★MethodsKey resources tableREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERAntibodiesAnti-CD56 Monoclonal Antibody (56C04) (anti-NCAM1)Thermo Fisher ScientificCat# MA5-11563Anti-NCAM1 antibody [CAL53]AbcamCat# ab237708Anti-Polysialic Acid-NCAM Antibody, clone 2-2BMerck MilliporeCat# MAB5324Anti-Fyn AntibodySanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-434Anti-Fyn AntibodyCell Signaling TechnologyCat# 4023Anti-FAK AntibodyCell Signaling TechnologyCat# 3285Anti-Phospho-FAK (Tyr397) AntibodyCell Signaling TechnologyCat# 3283Anti-MEK1 antibodyAbcamCat# ab32088Anti-phospho-MEK1 (Thr386)MilliporeCat# 07-853Anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) AntibodyCell Signaling TechnologyCat# 9102Anti-Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (D13.14.4E) XP Rabbit mAbCell Signaling TechnologyCat# 4370Anti-GST antibodySanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-458Anti-6x-His Tag Monoclonal Antibody (3D5)Thermo Fisher ScientificCat# R930-25Anti-RGS-His AntibodyQIAGENCat# 34650Anti-GAPDH Antibody, clone 6C5Merck MilliporeCat# MAB374Anti-NFκB p65Santa Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-372Anti-Iba1 antibodyFujifilm WAKO chemicalsCat# 019-19741Anti-CD171 (L1CAM) Antibody (UJ127)Thermo Fisher ScientificCat# MA514140Anti-NCAM2 Antibody (2H2L19)Thermo Fisher ScientificCat# 703642Anti-Contactin 2 (TAG1) AntibodyThermo Fisher ScientificCat# PA5-101541Cy3 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Human IgGJackson ImmunoResearch LaboratoriesCat# 709-165-149Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488Thermo Fisher ScientificCat# A-21206Goat Anti-Mouse IgM HRP ConjugateTGICat# G0417Anti-Rabbit IgG, HRP-Linked Whole AbCytivaCat# NA934Anti-Mouse IgG, HRP-Linked Whole AbCytivaCat# NA931Anti-Human IgG Antibody, HRP conjugateMerck MilliporeCat# AP112PAnti-human IgG-alkaline phosphataseSigma-AldrichCat# 2064Bacterial and virus strainsAAV1-SYN1-EGFPDr. Shin-ichi Muramatsu (Jichi medical university)N/AAAV2-VAMP2-mCherryVector BioLabsBuild-to-OrderBiological samplesHuman serumThis studyN/AHuman cerebrospinal fluidThis studyN/AChemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteinsNCAM Protein, Human, Recombinant (ECD, His Tag)Sino BiologicalCat# 10673-H08HRecombinant Human NCAM1enQuire BioCat# QP8663-ecGDNF Human Recombinant ProteinOrigeneCat# TP760516GSTThis studyN/ANi-NTA AgaroseQIAGENCat# 30210Glutathione Sepharose 4BCytivaCat# 17513201Lipofectamine 2000InvitrogenCat# 11668-019B27GIBCOCat# 17504044Protein G HP SpinTrapCytivaCat# 28903134SIGMAFAST p-nitrophenyl phosphate tabletsSigma-AldrichCat# N1891DMEMSigma-AldrichCat# D5796Neurobasal MediumThermo Fisher ScientificCat# 21103049Protein G SepharoseCytivaCat# 17061801ECL PrimeCytivaCat# RPN2232DAPIDOJINDOCat# 342-07431Zenon Alexa Fluor 568 Rabbit IgG Labeling KitThermo Fisher ScientificCat# Z25306THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR MixTOYOBOCat# QPS-201SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kitInvitrogenCat# 11754050RNeasy Mini kitQIAGENCat# 74104Critical commercial assaysHuman N-CAM1 ELISARayBiotechCat# ELH-NCAM1-1Experimental models: Cell linesHeLa cellATCCCat# 300194/p772_HeLa, RRID:CVCL_0030Primary cortical neuronsThis paperN/AExperimental models: Organisms/strainsC57BL/6J miceCLEA JapanRRID:IMSR_JCL:JCL:mIN-0003OligonucleotidesOligonucleotides are described in Table S2N/AN/ARecombinant DNApRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM1VectorBuilderBuild-to-OrderpRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM1ΔIg1This paperN/ApRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM1ΔIg2This paperN/ApRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM1ΔIg2-5This paperN/ApRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM1ΔIg1-5This paperN/ApRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hNCAM2VectorBuilderBuild-to-OrderpRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hL1CAMVectorBuilderBuild-to-OrderpRP[Exp]-EGFP-CMV>hCNTN2(TAG1)VectorBuilderBuild-to-OrderSoftware and algorithmsGraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3)GraphPad Software Inc.RRID:SCR_002798ImarisBitplaneRRID:SCR_007370Packwin software V2.0Panlabhttps://www.panlab.com/en/products/packwin-software-panlabImageJNational Institute of HealthRRID: SCR_003070SMART video-tracking systemPanlabRRID: SCR_002852Fluoview FV10-ASWOlympusRRID:SCR_014215Resource availabilityLead contactFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Hiroki Shiwaku (shiwaku.npat@mri.tmd.ac.jp).Materials availabilityPlasmids generated in this study is available from the lead contact upon request following completion of a Material Transfer Agreement.Experimental model and subject detailsSubjectsSerum was obtained from 223 patients with schizophrenia, and from 201 healthy controls. Patients were inpatients at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Medical Hospital, Kurita Hospital, and Takatsuki Hospital between April 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. All were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM5 criteria. None of the healthy controls had a previous history of psychiatric disorders. Healthy control sera were obtained from healthy volunteers and BioBank at Bioresource Research Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. All participants were Japanese.EthicsThis study was performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments by the Science Council of Japan, the Helsinki Declaration, and Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects in Japan. It was approved by the Committees on Gene Recombination Experiments, Human Ethics, and Animal Experiments of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University (G2020-002A, M2000-1866, and A2020-113A). All participants provided written informed consent.Cell culture and transfectionHeLa cells were maintained at 37°C/5% CO2 in DMEM (SIGMA, MI, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, Cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mouse primary cerebral neurons were prepared from embryonic Day 15 C57BL/6J mice embryos. Cerebral cortexes (n = 4 to 6) were dissected, incubated with 0.05% trypsin in 4 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 15 min, and dissociated by pipetting. The cells were passed through a 70 μm cell strainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), collected by centrifugation, and cultured in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 2% B27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in the presence of 0.5 μM AraC. Immunohistochemistry of primary neurons was performed at 14 days (DIV 14).MiceC57BL/6J mice were obtained from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were housed in standard cages in a temperature and humidity-controlled room with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00). Purified human IgGs were injected into the subarachnoid space of the frontal cortex of 8-week-old mice. Molecular, histological, two-photon microscopy, and behavioral analyses were performed in 9-week-old mice. Investigators were blind to the treatment of mice when performing experiments and analyzing the data.Method detailsSerum samples and CSF samplesSerum samples were collected in the morning following an overnight fast or more than 2 h after eating. CSF samples were also collected from patients with schizophrenia with anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in the morning within a month after serum samples were collected. The serum and CSF were aliquoted and stored in a −80 °C freezer. Cell-based assay and ELISA were performed with newly thawed samples and avoided freeze and thaw.Construction of DNA vectorsNCAM1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were cloned into a pRP vector (VectorBuilder, TX, USA) and expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Figure S1A). NCAM1 deletion constructs were generated using PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and the primers (Table S2).Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody ELISAPolystyrene microtiter plates (3455, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 100 μL (2 μg/mL) of NCAM1 recombinant protein (10673-H08H, Sino Biological) in TBS buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed three times with TBS and then incubated for 1 h at 24°C with 100 μL/well TBS containing 1% BSA to block non-specific binding. They then incubated for 1h at 24°C with 100 μL of each dilution of serum and CSF samples (1:50 for serum, 1:1 for CSF in TBS containing 1% BSA). The plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase (1:50000; Cat# 2064, Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS, 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl phosphate in substrate buffer (N1891, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well. Absorbance at 405 nm was read on a microplate reader (Spark 10M, TECAN).Serum-soluble NCAM ELISASerum-soluble NCAM ELISA was performed with ELISA kit (ELH-NCAM1-1, RayBiotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, recombinant NCAM for a standard curve and serum (1:10 dilution with the diluent provided in the kit) were added to provided ELISA plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed four times with the provided wash buffer and then incubated with biotinylated anti-Human N-CAM1 antibody provided in the kit for 1 h at 24 °C. After washing, HRP-conjugated streptavidin provided in the kit was added to each well and incubated for 45 min at 24°C. After washing, 3,3,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine provided in the kit was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 24°C. The reaction was terminated with 0.2 M sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was read on a microplate reader (Spark 10M, TECAN). The coefficients of variation in the intra- and inter-assay were 4.7–6.0% and 4.0–9.1%, respectively. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The operating range for the assay was 0.61–150 ng/mL.Western blot analysisSamples were lysed in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerin, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromophenol blue. Samples were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) using a semi-dry method, and blocked with 5% milk in TBS/Tween 20 (TBST) (10 mM Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The filters were incubated overnight at 4°C with each primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were diluted in Can Get Signal solution (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan): anti-NCAM1 (1:1000; MA5-11563, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); anti-NCAM (1:1000, ab237708, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-phosphorylated-ERK1 (1:1000; #4370, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); anti-ERK1 (1:1000, #9102, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); anti-GST (1:1000; sc-458, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-His (1:1000; R930-25, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); anti-RGS-His Antibody 1:1000 (QIAGEN); anti-MEK1 (1:1000. ab32088, Abcam); anti-phospho-MEK1 (Thr386) (1:1000, 07-853, Millipore), anti-Polysialic Acid-NCAM antibody clone 2-2B (1:1000, MAB5324, Millipore), anti-Fyn antibody (1:1000, sc-434, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FAK antibody (1:1000, 3285, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Phospho-FAK (Tyr397) antibody (1:1000, 3283, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-GAPDH (1:1000–10,000; MAB374, Merck Millipore). Secondary antibodies were HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; NA934, Cytiva, USA); HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG (1:3000; NA931, Cytiva, USA); and HRP-linked anti-human IgG (1:3000; AP112P, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Proteins were detected using ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (RPN2232, Cytiva, USA) and a luminescence image analyzer (ImageQuant LAS 500, Cytiva, USA).ImmunoprecipitaionMouse cerebral cortex was lysed in a homogenizer with RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% DOC, 0.5% protease inhibitor cocktail (539134, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA)). Lysates were rotated for 60 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged (16,000 g × 10 min at 4°C). Lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-NCAM (1:200, ab237708, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 16 h at 4°C with rotation. Then lysates were incubated with protein G–Sepharose beads (17061801, Cytiva) for 2h, and then the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer (125 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% BPB, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), separated on SDS–PAGE, and blotted with anti-Fyn (1:1000, sc-434, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA).Immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and cell-based assaysHeLa cells and primary cortical neurons were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde (prepared in phosphate buffer), treated for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked for 30 min at room temperature with PBS containing 10% FBS or 1% BSA, and then incubated with either serum or primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. For the cell based assay, serum with an autoantibody titer ≥1:30 was defined as autoantibody-positive. Previous studies show that NMDA receptor autoantibody and GABA receptor autoantibody titers are usually higher than 1:30.9,10,77 Furthermore, diluting the serum has the advantage of preventing nonspecific staining. For immunohistochemistry, brain samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal or coronal sections (5 μm thick) were cut using a microtome (Microm HM 335 E, GMI, Ramsey, USA). Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry were performed using the following primary antibodies: anti-NCAM (1:200, MA5-11563, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); anti-NCAM (1:200, ab237708, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-CD171 (L1CAM) (UJ127) (1:200, MA514140, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-NCAM2 (2H2L19) (1:200, 703642, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Contactin 2 (TAG1) (1:200, PA5-101541, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-NFκB p65 (1:200, sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); and anti-Iba1 (1:200, 019-19741, WAKO). These were detected using Cy3-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:500, 709-165-149, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA); Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, A21206, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and a Zenon Alexa Fluor 568 Rabbit IgG Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Z25306, Waltham, MA, USA). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.2 μg/mL in PBS; DOJINDO). Images were acquired under an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).Behavioral testsAll behavioral tests were analyzed by a video-computerized tracking system (SMART, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). All behavioral tests were performed with Male C57BL/6J mice.Open field testMice were placed in an open field box (40 × 40 × 22 cm) and allowed to explore freely for 10 min. The total distance moved and the time spent in the central zone (20 × 20 cm) were measured.Three-chamber sociability testMice were placed in a three-chambered box. Each chamber measured 40 cm by 20 cm by 22 cm (L, W, H). The dividing chamber walls contained openings allowing access into each chamber. The test comprised three sessions. During the first session (habituation), the mouse was allowed to explore three chambers for 5 min; then, the mouse was confined in the central chamber for another 5 min. In the following session (sociability), an unfamiliar mouse was placed in the wire cup in one of the side chambers and the test mouse was allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 10 min. In the last (social novelty preference) session, a new unfamiliar mouse was placed in the wire cup in the opposite side chamber and the test mouse was allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 10 min. The time spent in each chamber and actual interaction time was recorded. The interaction time in the figure is based on actual interaction time.Elevated plus maze testThe elevated plus maze comprised two open arms and two closed arms (30 × 6 cm; 15 cm walls; apparatus suspended 50 cm above the floor). Mice were placed in the central square of the maze and activity was recorded for 5 min. Time spent in the open and closed arms was measured.PPI testThe test was conducted using sound-attenuating startle boxes (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). After acclimation for 5 min with background noise (65dB), the mouse was exposed to 10 blocks of six types of startle stimulus in pseudorandomized order. The trial types were as follows: startle-only; 40 ms, 120 dB sound burst; five pre-pulse trials; 120 dB startle stimulus preceded 100 ms earlier by 20 ms prepulses (69, 73, 77, 81, or 85 dB). The maximum startle response was recorded for each startle stimulus.Y mazeMice were placed at the end of one arm and allowed to move freely through the maze during an 8 min session. The percentage of spontaneous alterations (indicated as an alteration rate) was calculated by dividing the number of entries into a new arm different from the previous one by the total number of transfers from one arm to another arm.Pull-down assayPurified IgGs (12 μg), His-NCAM1 (250 ng) (16067-H08H, SinoBiological) or His-GDNF (250 ng) (TP760516, Origene), and GST-NCAM1 (250 ng) (QP8663-EC, enQuire BioReagents) or GST (250 ng) were prepared as described previously78, mixed in 400 μL of TBS, and incubated at 4°C for 12 h. After addition of 50 μL Ni-NTA agarose (30210, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or glutathione Sepharose (17513201, Cytiva, USA), the mixtures were incubated for a further 3 h at 4°C, centrifuged, and washed five times with TBS. Next, the beads were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and boiled at 95°C for 10 min.Purification of IgG from serumIgG was purified from serum using Protein G HP SpinTrap columns (28903134, Cytiva, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Intrathecal injection of IgGsMice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane using a small animal anesthetizer (TK-7, BioMachinery, Japan). Using an injection needle made with a micropipette puller (model P-1000, Sutter instrument, USA) and FemtoJet (Eppendorf, NY, USA), purified IgG (1 μg in 2 μL) from the serum of healthy controls or patients with schizophrenia was injected at the speed of 1 μL/min into the subarachnoid space of the frontal cortex of 8-week-old mice. Assuming a mouse CSF volume of 40 μL,79 the dilution rate used for purification and injection corresponded to a 400- to 600-fold dilution from the serum. Because the antibody titer of anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in serum are 1:1000-1:10000, we considered that the dilution rate used was appropriate for analyzing these autoantibodies (Table 1).Two-photon microscopic analysisThis procedure has been described previously.80,81 Briefly, Adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1)-EGFP harboring the synapsin I promoter (titer: 1 × 1010 vector genomes/mL; 1 μL) and AAV2-VAMP2-mCherry harboring the CMV promoter were injected into adjacent positions in the frontal cortex (+1.0 mm from bregma (mediolateral 0.5 mm; depth, 1 mm; and +3.0 mm from bregma (mediolateral 0.5 mm; depth, 1 mm), respectively) under anesthesia with 1% isoflurane.Two-photon imaging was performed using a laser-scanning microscope system FV1000MPE2 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an upright microscope (BX61WI, Olympus, Japan), a water-immersion objective lens (XLPlanN25xW; numerical aperture, 1.05), and a pulsed laser (MaiTaiHP DeepSee, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA). EGFP and mCherry were excited at 920 nm and scanned at 495–540 nm and 575–630 nm, respectively. High-magnification imaging (101.28 μm × 101.28 μm; 1024 × 1024 pixels; 1 μm Z step) of cortical layer I was performed with a 5 × digital zoom through a thinned-skull window in the frontal cortex. Blinded observers performed image acquisition and analysis. Image processing was performed with Imaris Interactive Microscopy Image Analysis software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).Real-time qPCRThe total RNA was prepared from the frontal cortex of mice using an RNeasy Mini kit (74104, QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kit (11754-250, Invitrogen, USA). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Expression of individual genes was normalized to that of GAPDH. qRT-PCR was performed using the primers listed in Table S2.Quantification and statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, Inc, CA, USA). ELISA data and cell-based assay data were analyzed with a Mann–Whitney U test. Data groups were compared by Tukey’s HSD test unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. Sample size was determined based on our previous studies.81 All experiments were randomized. A p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Exact value of n, definition of center and dispersion and precision measures are described in the figure legends.References1Meyer-LindenbergA.From maps to mechanisms through neuroimaging of schizophreniaNature468201019420210.1038/nature09569210688272Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic lociNature511201442142710.1038/nature13595250560613RajarajanP.BorrmanT.LiaoW.SchrodeN.FlahertyE.CasiñoC.PowellS.YashaswiniC.LaMarcaE.A.KassimB.Neuron-specific signatures in the chromosomal connectome associated with schizophrenia riskScience3622018eaat431110.1126/science.aat4311305458514The NetworkPathway Analysis Subgroup of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumPsychiatric genome-wide association study analyses implicate neuronal, immune and histone pathwaysNat.
