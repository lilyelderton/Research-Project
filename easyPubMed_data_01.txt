TI  - NMDAR autoantibodies in psychiatric disease - An immunopsychiatric continuum and 
      potential predisposition for disease pathogenesis.

AB  - N-Methyl-d-Aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis is a disease
      discovered two decades ago. Our knowledge about it has recently deepened
      dramatically. However, the significance of NMDAR antibodies in psychiatric
      disease cannot be determined if there are no clear indications of brain
      inflammation or an autoimmune encephalitis mediated by NMDAR antibodies.
      Furthermore, the long-term interaction and connection between these two disease
      entities are unclear. In this paper we aim to elucidate the relationship between 
      these disease entities. We propose two distinct models that explain the on the
      one hand a condition in which a minor inflammatory state as in psychiatric
      disease culminates in a severe state of inflammation characterized by NMDAR
      encephalitis. On the other hand, we postulate a model in which an NMDAR
      encephalitis might later create favorable conditions for inducing psychiatric
      disease. These models should be kept in mind for further investigations examining
      the long-term outcome of NMDAR autoantibody immunity in the brain and its
      functions.

      neurocircuitry in a mouse model of breast cancer.

AB  - The prevalence of stress-related comorbidities is increased approximately 3-fold 
      in cancer patients compared to the general population. There is a scarcity of
      research focusing on the biological brain changes caused by the cancer due to the
      assumption that psychological symptoms are solely caused by the stress of a
      cancer diagnosis. Recent clinical evidence indicates that declines in cognition
      and increases in mood symptoms occur prior to an individual receiving a cancer
      diagnosis, suggesting that the cancer itself may play a role in mediating
      biological brain change. Furthermore, the presence of a tumour may change the
      brain response to environmental stressors unrelated to a cancer diagnosis. Using 
      a syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we compared the impact of
      mammary tumours and chronic restraint stress on microglial and astrocytic
      activation throughout stress-relevant neurocircuitry. We also examined whether
      changes in microglial and astrocytic activation overlapped with changes in
      chronic neuronal activity. We show that cancer and chronic restraint stress
      activates microglia to the same magnitude in the same subcortical brain regions, 
      and that this activation correlates with stress coping behaviours. The findings
      suggest that in some cancer patients, microglia may be activated in brain regions
      involved in interpreting and responding to psychological distress before they are
      aware of their diagnosis. In contrast, cancer reduced astrocyte reactivity in two
      cortical brain regions where there were no clear changes in response to chronic
      restraint stress. Taken together, it is likely that interventions that aim to
      improve anxiety and stress in cancer patients by targeting glial responses to
      cancer would need to be cell-specific; reducing microglial activation and/or
      stimulating astrocytic activation.

TI  - Immunopsychiatry of Infected Ears, Sinuses, Skulls, and Meninges: Mast Cells,
      Mozart, Van Gogh.
PG  - 265-275
AB  - Medical psychiatry acquires more prominence in the biological field by new
      anatomical insights into the wrappings of the brain: meninges, but also
      Meningo-Calvarial Channels (MCCs) connecting the former with the bone marrows'
      also neuronally steered, functions. The skull-bone's meningeal arteries through
      migrating and orchestrating mast cells within a framework stressing their
      relations with arteries (Treviranus 2012-21) could explain enigmatic phenomena
      like migrainous and post-injury Cortical Spreading Depressions (CSD) or the
      Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) escalating to "PRES". The
      skull might be accessed along chronic (para-)infectious paths resulting in Skull 
      Bone Osteomyelitis (SBO) from the ear-nose-throat, dental and other microbiomes. 
      Such paths seem promoted by compromised innate immune defenses: by "Mendelian"
      susceptibility, and/or acquired anti-INF-gamma- or other auto-immunity or various
      microbial "Trojans" of e. g. meningeal myelo- and lymphocytes. These interact e. 
      g. from the calvarial marrow niches onward. Hereby competing local and
      "intentional" intruding mast cells - by disturbing (or ingeniously boosting)
      cortical development and functioning - acquire relevance by interacting with
      arteries (Treviranus 2018, 2021). This predicts findings in behavior (Fitzpatrick
      & Morrow 2017) an "aortal" arterial biomechanical foundation of parasympathetic
      reverse arterio-intramural cerebro-interstitial drainage by CIMURAF/IPAD-2.0
      (Treviranus 2018-21). Here the recent physiological re-conceptions of the skull
      illuminate own case histories through a gamut of possibly relevant
      neuro(-surgico)-psychiatric challenges. Among these meningo-cerebral immune,
      vasospastic, and cystic processes some generate broad "experiential"
      hallucinations, which may slowly transit to true psychoses through "perfect crime
      lesions" of neurons and glia by tryptase-armed mast cells descending into
      parenchyma often congested by "push-back". These emerging hypotheses coalesce in 
      advancing an integrative macro-medical psychiatry and even the pathography of Van
      Gogh and Mozart stressing the benign and creative roles of mast cells.

TI  - Dietary intake in children on the autism spectrum is altered and linked to
      differences in autistic traits and sensory processing styles.
LID - 10.1002/aur.2798 [doi]
AB  - Diets of children and adolescents on the autism spectrum often differ when
      compared to their non-autistic peers. Most dietary studies have been limited by
      small sample sizes and rarely assess the heterogeneity of autism. Addressing this
      gap, this study compared the anthropometrics, dietary composition, dietary
      quality, and food variety of 154 Australian children and adolescents on the
      spectrum and 213 non-autistic children (71 siblings and 142 unrelated controls). 
      Beyond the case-control approach, within-group comparisons assessed the influence
      of autism clinical presentations and sensory processing styles on body mass index
      (BMI) and measures of dietary intake among those on the spectrum. In this word
      first study of diet that included between-group comparisons with non-autistic
      peers (siblings and an unrelated comparison group) and within-autism group
      comparisons, we found that children on the spectrum consumed limited variety and 
      lower quality of food and non-autistic siblings also ate comparably higher levels
      of energy-dense, nutrient poor food, and less diary. This may be due to autistic 
      traits influencing family's diets or shared sensory sensitivities driving dietary
      intake. Within the autism group, higher autistic traits were associated with
      lower BMIs and a specific dietary pattern higher in simple carbohydrates and
      lower in unprocessed protein. Contrastingly, greater sensitivity to sensory
      stimuli was associated with a healthier diet. Increased age was linked to more
      varied diets but also diets higher in saturated fats and energy-dense, nutrient
      poor foods. Overall, this research highlights that potential mediators of dietary
      intake, such as familial influences, autistic traits, sensory processing styles, 
      age and sex, need to be considered when assessing diet in the autistic
      population. LAY SUMMARY: In this study of dietary differences linked to autism,
      children, and teenagers on the spectrum ate fewer different foods and were less
      likely to eat recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables when compared to
      non-autistic siblings and unrelated children and teenagers. There were also
      family differences, in that those on the spectrum and their siblings ate more
      unhealthy foods and less dairy. Among those on the spectrum, dietary differences 
      were linked to age, sex, autistic traits and sensory processing styles.

AB  - Background: Anti-neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease is a novel
      field in immunopsychiatry that has been attracting attention thanks to its
      potentially positive therapeutic outcome and distinct prognosis compared with
      non-organic psychiatric disease. This review aims to describe recent novel
      technological developments for improving diagnostics in the field of
      autoantibody-related psychiatric disease. Methods: We screened for relevant
      articles in PubMed for this narrative article. We focused on research methods
      such as neuroimaging, immune cells and inflammation markers, and molecular
      biomarkers in human biofluids like serum and cerebrospinal fluid and plasma
      proteomics. Results: We introduce several novel methods for investigating
      autoinflammation with the aim of optimizing therapies for autoantibody-associated
      psychiatric disease. We describe measuring the translocator protein 18kDa in
      activated microglia via positron emission tomography imaging, brain volumetric
      assessment, flow cell cytometry of cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and blood
      biological probes as well as psychopathological cues to help us gain insights
      into diagnosing inflammation and brain damage better in psychiatric patients
      presenting a suspected autoimmune etiology. Conclusion: Our short methodological 
      review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of
      autoantibody-related immunopsychiatry. More research is needed to prove their
      usefulness in diagnosing and treating autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease
      and its subtypes.

TI  - Autoantibodies against NCAM1 from patients with schizophrenia cause
      schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses in mice.
PG  - 100597
LID - 10.1016/j.xcrm.2022.100597 [doi]
AB  - From genetic and etiological studies, autoimmune mechanisms underlying
      schizophrenia are suspected; however, the details remain unclear. In this study, 
      we describe autoantibodies against neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) in
      patients with schizophrenia (5.4%, cell-based assay; 6.7%, ELISA) in a Japanese
      cohort (n = 223). Anti-NCAM1 autoantibody disrupts both NCAM1-NCAM1 and
      NCAM1-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interactions.
      Furthermore, the anti-NCAM1 antibody purified from patients with schizophrenia
      interrupts NCAM1-Fyn interaction and inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, MEK1, and
      ERK1 when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice and also reduces the
      number of spines and synapses in frontal cortex. In addition, it induces
      schizophrenia-related behavior in mice, including deficient pre-pulse inhibition 
      and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, anti-NCAM1 autoantibodies in patients
      with schizophrenia cause schizophrenia-related behavior and changes in synapses
      in mice. These antibodies may be a potential therapeutic target and serve as a
      biomarker to distinguish a small but treatable subgroup in heterogeneous patients
      with schizophrenia.

TI  - Disrupting circadian rhythms promotes cancer-induced inflammation in mice.
PG  - 100428
LID - 10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100428 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of circadian rhythms occurs in rotating shift-work, jetlag, and in
      individuals with irregular sleep schedules. Circadian disruption is known to
      alter inflammatory responses and impair immune function. However, there is
      limited understanding of how circadian disruption modulates cancer-induced
      inflammation. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and is linked to worse
      prognosis and impaired brain function in cancer patients. Here, we investigated
      the effect of circadian disruption on cancer-induced inflammation in an
      orthotopic breast cancer model. Using a validated chronic jetlag protocol that
      advances the light-cycle by 8 h every 2 days to disrupt circadian rhythms, we
      found that circadian disruption alters cancer-induced inflammation in a
      tissue-specific manner, increasing inflammation in the body and brain while
      decreasing inflammation within the tumor tissue. Circadian disruption did not
      affect inflammation in mice without tumors, suggesting that the impact of
      circadian disruption may be particularly detrimental in the context of underlying
      inflammatory conditions, such as cancer. Importantly, circadian disruption did
      not affect tumor burden, suggesting that increased inflammation was not a result 
      of increased cancer progression. Overall, these findings identify the importance 
      of healthy circadian rhythms for limiting cancer-induced inflammation.

TI  - The role of yoga in inflammatory markers.
PG  - 100421
LID - 10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100421 [doi]
AB  - Yoga is an ancient system for integrating the mind, body, and spirit. In the
      hatha yoga ashtanga tradition (the eight limb Patanjali Yoga), three of the limbs
      are meditation, breathwork (pranayama) and physical postures (asana), which are
      widely practised in yoga classes. The benefits of yoga for mental and physical
      health are rooted in the practice's origins: in yoga, stress is said to be the
      root of all diseases. The established fields of psychoneuroimmunology and
      immunopsychiatry study the interplay between the immune system and mood or mental
      states. This mini-review has shifted the emphasis from research that focuses on
      yoga's benefits for stress, the most commonly studied outcome of yoga research,
      to a summary of the research on the effects of yoga practices on the immune
      system. The current literature bears strong evidence for the benefits of yoga on 
      the levels of circulating cortisol and classical inflammatory markers, such as
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
      interferon-gamma (INF-gamma). The evidence for other less studied markers,
      telomerase activity, beta-endorphins, Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also growing. This mini-review centres around the
      interplay between yoga and these markers in stress management and depression,
      vascular and immune function in the older population, cardiovascular and
      metabolic diseases, auto-immune diseases, breast cancer and pregnancy. Overall,
      the literature examined reveals the novelty of this field of research and sheds
      light on methodological challenges; however, it uncovers the potential for yoga
      to be used as adjuvant therapy in conditions with an inflammatory component.

PG  - 155-167
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2022.2038136 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a group of immune-mediated
      inflammatory processes of the brain with marked psychiatric features. Although
      relatively rare, they might offer difficult differential diagnosis with
      psychiatric conditions, especially catatonia and psychotic syndromes.
      Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common AIE,
      presenting with psychiatric syndromes in 90% of cases. The associated
      psychopathology is complex, pleomorphic, and best characterized when there is
      involvement of a psychiatrist in the assessment. AREAS COVERED: This text will
      review the main aspects of AIE to psychiatrists and/or neuropsychiatrists. EXPERT
      OPINION: Immune system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
      psychiatric symptoms and disorders. The use of diagnostic criteria for possible
      AIE, especially when specific antibodies of AIE are not available, allows early
      diagnosis and prompt treatment which are associated with better clinical
      outcomes. The study of the psychiatric aspects of AIE can broaden our knowledge
      of the underlying mechanisms of various psychiatric manifestations.

TI  - NSAID use and unnatural deaths after cancer diagnosis: a nationwide cohort study 
      in Sweden.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12885-021-09120-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience increased risk of death from accident and 
      suicide. Cognitive impairment induced by cancer-related inflammation and
      stress-related psychiatric symptoms may be underlying mechanisms. We therefore
      studied the association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) and risk of these outcomes. METHODS: Following a cohort of 388,443
      cancer patients diagnosed between October 2005 and December 2014 in Sweden, we
      ascertained dispense of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs from 3 months before cancer
      diagnosis onward and defined the on-medication period as from date of drug
      dispense until the prescribed dosage was consumed. Follow-up time outside
      medicated periods and time from unexposed patients were defined as off-medication
      periods. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death due to
      suicide or accident, by comparing the on-medication periods with off-medication
      periods. RESULTS: In total, 29.7% of the cancer patients had low-dose aspirin
      dispensed and 29.1% had non-aspirin NSAIDs dispensed. Patients with aspirin use
      were more likely to be male than patients without aspirin use. Compared with
      off-medication periods, there was a 22% lower risk of accidental death (N = 651; 
      HR 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 to 0.87) during on-medication periods
      with aspirin. The use of aspirin was not associated with risk of suicide (N = 59;
      HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.39). No association was noted between use of
      non-aspirin NSAIDs and the risk of suicide (N = 13; HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.42 to
      2.18) or accidental death (N = 59; HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of low-dose aspirin after cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower
      risk of unnatural deaths among cancer patients.

TI  - Research priorities for neuroimmunology: identifying the key research questions
      to be addressed by 2030.
PG  - 194
LID - 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16997.1 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimmunology in the broadest sense is the study of interactions between the
      nervous and the immune systems. These interactions play important roles in health
      from supporting neural development, homeostasis and plasticity to modifying
      behaviour. Neuroimmunology is increasingly recognised as a field with the
      potential to deliver a significant positive impact on human health and treatment 
      for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, translation to the clinic is
      hindered by fundamental knowledge gaps on the underlying mechanisms of action or 
      the optimal timing of an intervention, and a lack of appropriate tools to
      visualise and modulate both systems. Here we propose ten key disease-agnostic
      research questions that, if addressed, could lead to significant progress within 
      neuroimmunology in the short to medium term. We also discuss four cross-cutting
      themes to be considered when addressing each question: i) bi-directionality of
      neuroimmune interactions; ii) the biological context in which the questions are
      addressed (e.g. health vs disease vs across the lifespan); iii) tools and
      technologies required to fully answer the questions; and iv) translation into the
      clinic. We acknowledge that these ten questions cannot represent the full breadth
      of gaps in our understanding; rather they focus on areas which, if addressed, may
      have the most broad and immediate impacts. By defining these neuroimmunology
      priorities, we hope to unite existing and future research teams, who can make
      meaningful progress through a collaborative and cross-disciplinary effort.

TI  - Toward the unity of pathological and exertional fatigue: A predictive processing 
      model.
PG  - 215-228
LID - 10.3758/s13415-021-00958-x [doi]
AB  - Fatigue is a common experience in both health and disease. Yet, pathological
      (i.e., prolonged or chronic) and transient (i.e., exertional) fatigue symptoms
      are traditionally considered distinct, compounding a separation between
      interested research fields within the study of fatigue. Within the clinical
      neurosciences, nascent frameworks position pathological fatigue as a product of
      inference derived through hierarchical predictive processing. The metacognitive
      theory of dyshomeostasis (Stephan et al., 2016) states that pathological fatigue 
      emerges from the metacognitive mechanism in which the detection of persistent
      mismatches between prior interoceptive predictions and ascending sensory evidence
      (i.e., prediction error) signals low evidence for internal generative models,
      which undermine an agent's feeling of mastery over the body and is thus
      experienced phenomenologically as fatigue. Although acute, transient subjective
      symptoms of exertional fatigue have also been associated with increasing
      interoceptive prediction error, the dynamic computations that underlie its
      development have not been clearly defined. Here, drawing on the metacognitive
      theory of dyshomeostasis, we extend this account to offer an explicit description
      of the development of fatigue during extended periods of (physical) exertion.
      Accordingly, it is proposed that a loss of certainty or confidence in control
      predictions in response to persistent detection of prediction error features as a
      common foundation for the conscious experience of both pathological and
      nonpathological fatigue.

AB  - Most researchers working in the field of immunopsychiatry would agree with the
      statement that "severe psychiatric disorders are associated with inflammation and
      more broadly with changes in immune variables". However, as many other fields in 
      biology and medicine, immunopsychiatry suffers from a replication crisis
      characterized by lack of reproducibility. In this paper, we will comment on four 
      types of immune variables which have been studied in psychiatric disorders: Acute
      Phase Proteins (AAPs), cytokines, lipid mediators of inflammation and immune cell
      parameters, and discuss the rationale for looking at them in blood. We will
      briefly describe the analytical methods that are currently used to measure the
      levels of these biomarkers and comment on overlooked analytical and statistical
      methodological issues that may explain some of the conflicting data reported in
      the literature. Lastly, we will briefly summarize what cross-sectional,
      longitudinal and mendelian randomization studies have brought to our
      understanding of schizophrenia (SZ).

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear how to best measure the complex symptom presentation of
      pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). METHODS:
      Well-characterized participants of a 2-5 year follow-up study (n = 34; 56% male) 
      underwent clinical evaluations and completed scales assessing global symptom
      severity, functional impairment and specific psychiatric symptoms. We explored
      inter-correlations between the measures and used intraclass correlation
      coefficients to evaluate the agreement between clinician-, parent- and child
      ratings of the same constructs. RESULTS: Ratings on symptom-specific measures
      varied largely between participants. Agreement between informants was excellent
      on functional scales, fair-to-moderate on global severity scales and mixed on
      symptom-specific scales. Clinician-rated global and functional measures had
      stronger inter-correlations with parent- and child-rated functional measures than
      with symptom-specific measures. CONCLUSIONS: General instruments assessing global
      severity and functioning are well suited for the assessment and follow-up of
      PANS, but should be complemented by symptom-specific scales representative of
      core symptoms.

TI  - The future of immunopsychiatry: Three milestones to clinical innovation.
PG  - 100314
LID - 10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100314 [doi]
AB  - Psychoneuroimmunology, the area of research dedicated to understanding the
      fundamental interactions between the central nervous system and the immune
      system, has given rise to the development of Immunopsychiatry, a new discipline
      which harnesses the immune system to produce beneficial outcomes for mental
      health problems. Immunopsychiatry has the potential to become a clinically
      relevant specialty area in psychiatric practice, but has not yet been adopted by 
      the wider mental health community. This paper aims to map out the future
      trajectory of Immunopsychiatry on its road towards science-to-policy knowledge
      translation and clinical implementation. Three critical milestones which will
      need to be reached in order for Immunopsychiatry to fulfil its promise for
      clinical innovation are discussed: a clear definition of patients who fall within
      the immunopsychiatric continuum; demonstration of well-defined clinical benefit
      and incorporation in clinical guidelines; and convergence with other paradigms in
      biological psychiatry.

AB  - Immunopsychiatry is a subfield of psychoneuroimmunology that integrates
      immunological and psychopathological processes with promise for improving the
      classification, identification, and treatment of psychopathology. Using research 
      on the relationship between inflammation and depression as a running example,
      this mini-review will discuss three areas of work that should be emphasized in
      future research to maximize the replicability and clinical impact of the field:
      1) methodology with respect to planning data collection and statistical analyses 
      with measurement properties and conceptually important sources of variance in
      mind, 2) characterizing inflammatory phenotypes of psychopathology, and 3) the
      integration of inflammatory processes into robust, extant psychosocial
      theoretical frameworks of psychopathology risk. Consistent, parallel growth in
      all three areas will ensure immunopsychiatry research is replicable, contributes 
      to understanding of how (and for whom) the immune system is associated with
      psychiatric symptoms, and increases the flexibility and power of personalized
      treatment planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental disorders might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We aimed
      to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and 
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental
      disorder, and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders, and exposure to
      psychopharmacological drug classes. METHODS: In this systematic review and
      meta-analysis, we searched Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and PsycINFO
      databases between Jan 1, 2020, and March 5, 2021, for original studies reporting 
      data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with
      controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples, studies that were not
      peer-reviewed, and studies written in languages other than English, Danish,
      Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects
      meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2
      infection as the primary outcome, and hospitalisation and ICU admission as
      secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity 
      was assessed using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was tested with Egger
      regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to
      assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to
      assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to
      assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, 
      pandemic phase, quality assessment score, sample sizes, and adjustment for
      confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021233984. FINDINGS:
      841 studies were identified by the systematic search, of which 33 studies were
      included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising
      1 469 731 patients with COVID-19, of whom 43 938 had mental disorders. The sample
      included 130 807 females (8.9% of the whole sample) and 130 373 males (8.8%).
      Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity, and 22 studies were
      rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an
      increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.58-2.54]; I(2)=92.66%).
      This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (2.05 [1.37-3.06];
      I(2)=80.81%), mood disorders (1.99 [1.46-2.71]; I(2)=68.32%), substance use
      disorders (1.76 [1.27-2.44]; I(2)=47.90%), and intellectual disabilities and
      developmental disorders (1.73 [1.29-2.31]; I(2)=90.15%) but not for anxiety
      disorders (1.07 [0.73-1.56]; I(2)=11.05%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with
      exposure to antipsychotics (3.71 [1.74-7.91]; I(2)=90.31%), anxiolytics (2.58
      [1.22-5.44]; I(2)=96.42%), and antidepressants (2.23 [1.06-4.71]; I(2)=95.45%).
      For psychotic disorders, mood disorders, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, the
      association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and other
      confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of
      hospitalisation (2.24 [1.70-2.94]; I(2)=88.80%). No significant associations with
      mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and
      meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment
      setting (p=0.013) and country (p<0.0001) with mortality. No significant
      associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of 
      publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude
      mortality and hospitalisation, and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission.
      INTERPRETATION: Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood
      disorders, and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with
      COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models. Although further research
      is required to determine the underlying mechanisms, our findings highlight the
      need for targeted approaches to manage and prevent COVID-19 in at-risk patient
      groups identified in this study. FUNDING: None. TRANSLATIONS: For the Italian,

AB  - The multifaceted role of low-grade systemic inflammation in depression and
      physical illnesses like cardiovascular disease highlights complex interactions
      between the body, brain and mind. While current research on inflammation and
      depression has largely focused on exploring possible disease mechanisms and
      therapeutic potential, we seek to broaden the current discussion by introducing a
      public health perspective. In this Viewpoint, we propose that inflammation and
      its contributing sources could represent important targets for public health
      strategies aimed at improving both mental and physical health. We discuss
      potential universal, selective and indicated primary prevention strategies for
      inflammation-related depression. We consider potential approaches to secondary
      prevention, including scope for anti-inflammatory treatment and CRP testing for
      guiding treatment allocation and prognosis. Preventive strategies discussed here 
      could also be relevant for other inflammation-mediated mental health conditions.

TI  - Applicability, potential and limitations of TSPO PET imaging as a clinical
      immunopsychiatry biomarker.
PG  - 164-173
LID - 10.1007/s00259-021-05308-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: TSPO PET imaging may hold promise as a single-step diagnostic work-up
      for clinical immunopsychiatry. This review paper on the clinical applicability of
      TSPO PET for primary psychiatric disorders discusses if and why TSPO PET imaging 
      might become the first clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker and the investment
      prerequisites and scientific advancements needed to accommodate this transition
      from bench to bedside. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the
      literature to identify clinical studies of TSPO PET imaging in patients with
      primary psychiatric disorders. We included both original case-control studies as 
      well as longitudinal cohort studies of patients with a primary psychiatric
      diagnosis. RESULTS: Thirty-one original studies met our inclusion criteria. In
      the field of immunopsychiatry, TSPO PET has until now mostly been studied in
      schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, and to a lesser extent in mood
      disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantitative TSPO PET appears most
      promising as a predictive biomarker for the transdiagnostic identification of
      subgroups or disease stages that could benefit from immunological treatments, or 
      as a prognostic biomarker forecasting patients' illness course. Current scanning 
      protocols are still too unreliable, impractical and invasive for clinical use in 
      symptomatic psychiatric patients. CONCLUSION: TSPO PET imaging in its present
      form does not yet offer a sufficiently attractive cost-benefit ratio to become a 
      clinical immunopsychiatry biomarker. Its translation to psychiatric clinical
      practice will depend on the prioritising of longitudinal research and the
      establishment of a uniform protocol rendering clinically meaningful TSPO uptake
      quantification at the shortest possible scan duration without arterial
      cannulation.

AB  - This prospective service evaluation aimed to determine if integrated
      psychological support for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) enhanced
      outcomes. 75 patients were assessed and treated by a specialist liaison
      psychiatric service between 2015 and 2017; 43 received psychiatric intervention
      alone, 32 were referred for psychological intervention by clinical health
      psychologist; 26 completed this. Pre-post data (n=15 available) included global
      impression, quality of life, and psychiatric and IBD symptom scores.
      Referrer/patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness were retrospectively
      calculated. Psychological intervention led to reductions in IBD symptoms
      (DeltaSIBD; p=0.003), alongside improvements in depression scores (DeltaPHQ-9,
      p=0.006) and global impression (DeltaCGI; p=0.046). Patient/referrer satisfaction
      was very high. Indicative data comparing service utilisation 1 year before and
      after engagement found reductions in outpatient appointments and in imaging. This
      small study suggests consideration of increased access to integrated
      psychological support services to improve outcomes and gather further evidence of
      efficacy.

AB  - Little is known about the long-term prognosis of children with pediatric
      acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Out of the 46 eligible patients
      from the Karolinska PANS cohort, 34 consented to participate in a follow-up
      (median 3.3 years). Participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation and
      were classified according to their clinical course. Resulting groups were
      compared on clinical characteristics and laboratory test results. We observed
      significant reductions in clinician-rated PANS symptom severity and improved
      general function. Two patients were classified as remitted, 20 as
      relapsing-remitting, and 12 as having a chronic-static/progressive course. The
      latter group had an earlier onset, greater impairment and received more
      pharmacological and psychological treatments. Although remission was rare, the
      majority of children with PANS were significantly improved over the follow-up
      period but a non-negligible minority of patients displayed a
      chronic-static/progressive course and required additional treatments. The
      proposed definitions of flare and clinical course may be useful in future
      clinical trials.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raising global
      anxiety and fear of both real and perceived health threat from the virus.
      Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric
      complications, suggesting that the "psychoneuroimmunity" model might be
      beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special
      Issue on "Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic" was launched immediately after
      the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020.
      A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 
      2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special
      Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological
      manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on
      COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation
      are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central
      and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders,
      encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A "three-steps" Neuro-COVID
      infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. 
      The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive
      intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion.
      Psychological support should be implemented, improving the psychological
      wellbeing, as well as to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.

TI  - Relationship Between Serum NMDA Receptor Antibodies and Response to Antipsychotic
      Treatment in First-Episode Psychosis.
PG  - 9-15

AB  - BACKGROUND: When psychosis develops in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibody
      encephalitis, it usually has an acute or subacute onset, and antipsychotic
      treatment may be ineffective and associated with adverse effects. Serum NMDAR
      antibodies have been reported in a minority of patients with first-episode
      psychosis (FEP), but their role in psychosis onset and response to antipsychotic 
      treatment is unclear. METHODS: Sera from 387 patients with FEP (duration of
      psychosis <2 years, minimally or never treated with antipsychotics) undergoing
      initial treatment with amisulpride as part of the OPTiMiSE (Optimization of
      Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in Europe) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
      number NCT01248195) were tested for NMDAR IgG antibodies using a live cell-based 
      assay. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale at baseline and again after 4
      weeks of treatment with amisulpride. RESULTS: At baseline, 15 patients were
      seropositive for NMDAR antibodies and 372 were seronegative. The seropositive
      patients had similar symptom profiles and demographic features to seronegative
      patients but a shorter duration of psychosis (median 1.5 vs. 4.0 months; p =
      .031). Eleven seropositive and 284 seronegative patients completed 4 weeks of
      amisulpride treatment: after treatment, there was no between-groups difference in
      improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores or in the frequency of
      adverse medication effects. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in FEP, NMDAR
      antibody seropositivity alone is not an indication for using immunotherapy
      instead of antipsychotic medications. Further studies are required to establish
      what proportion of patients with FEP who are NMDAR antibody seropositive have
      coexisting cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory changes or other paraclinical
      evidence suggestive of a likely benefit from immunotherapy.

AB  - A growing number of studies are pointing out the need for a conceptual shift from
      a brain-centered to a body-inclusive approach in mental health research. In this 
      perspective, the link between the immune and the nervous system, which are deeply
      interconnected and continuously interacting, is one of the most important novel
      theoretical framework to investigate the biological bases of major depressive
      disorder and, more in general, mental illness. Indeed, depressed patients show
      high levels of inflammatory markers, administration of pro-inflammatory drugs
      triggers a depressive symptomatology and antidepressant efficacy is reduced by
      excessive immune system activation. A number of molecular and cellular mechanisms
      have been hypothesized to act as a link between the immune and brain function,
      thus representing potential pharmacologically targetable processes for the
      development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies. These include the
      modulation of the kynurenine pathway, the crosstalk between metabolic and
      inflammatory processes, the imbalance in acquired immune responses, in particular
      T cell responses, and the interplay between neural plasticity and immune system
      activation. In the personalized medicine approach, the assessment and regulation 
      of these processes have the potential to lead, respectively, to novel diagnostic 
      approaches for the prediction of treatment outcome according to the patient's
      immunological profile, and to improved efficacy of antidepressant compounds
      through immune modulation.

AB  - Inflammation has been proposed to play a causal role in chemobrain which-if
      true-would represent an opportunity to repurpose existing anti-inflammatory drugs
      for the prevention and treatment of chemobrain. Here, we show that the chemoagent
      paclitaxel induces memory impairment and anhedonia in mice within 24 h of
      treatment cessation, but inflammation is not present until 2 weeks after
      treatment. We find no evidence of brain inflammation as measured by cytokine
      analysis at any time point. Furthermore, treating with aspirin to block
      inflammation did not affect paclitaxel-induced memory impairment. These findings 
      suggest that inflammation may not be responsible for memory impairment induced by
      paclitaxel. These results contrast with recent findings of a causal role for
      inflammation in cancer-induced memory deficits in mice that were prevented by
      treatment with oral aspirin, suggesting that cognitive impairment in cancer
      patients undergoing treatment may arise from multiple convergent mechanisms.

      influences CRP and depression criteria associations in network analyses.

AB  - Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than
      diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network
      analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify
      associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all
      other variables modeled. However, investigation into how methodological decisions
      (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) >10
      mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to 
      establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. In 
      a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for
      associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite and some support for
      additional CRP-criterion associations. Methodologically, results consistently
      demonstrated that including individuals with CRP >10 mg/L and estimating
      nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Thus, we
      recommend considering the use of nonregularized networks in immunopsychiatry and 
      inclusion of cases with CRP values >10 mg/L when testing the association between 
      CRP and depression criteria, unless contraindicated by the research question
      being tested. Additionally, results most consistently suggest that CRP is
      uniquely related to fatigue and changes in appetite, supporting their inclusion
      in an immunometabolic phenotype of depression. Finally, these associations
      suggest that fatigue and changes in appetite might be particularly receptive to
      anti-inflammatory treatments. However, future research with more nuanced measures
      is necessary to parse out whether appetite increases or decreases drive this
      association. Further, longitudinal research is an important next step to test how
      these relationships manifest over time.

AB  - Increased plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to acute hypoglycemia
      have been well documented. Aiming to study the interaction between IL-6 and
      counter-regulatory hormones during hypoglycemic stress we conducted an
      exploratory single center study involving 26 adult patients undergoing insulin
      tolerance test. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia elicited a significant dynamic
      response of IL-6, adrenaline, noradrenaline, GH, prolactin, ACTH and serum and
      salivary cortisol (P < 0.001 for all variables). Patients with insufficient HPA
      axis response had lower hypoglycemia-induced IL-6 increase (median: 0.88 pg/mL)
      compared with individuals with intact HPA axis response (2.03 pg/mL, P = 0.007). 
      IL-6 maximal increase correlated with the maximal increase of serum cortisol (rs 
      = 0.48; P = 0.013), salivary cortisol (rs = 0.66; P = 0.012), plasma ACTH (rs =
      0.48; P = 0.013) and with the increase in procedure-related symptoms of anxiety
      and hypoglycemia (rs = 0.57; P = 0.003). In conclusion, hypoglycemic
      stress-induced IL-6 increase is associated with activation of the HPA axis,
      suggesting that IL-6 response to hypoglycemic stress may be regarded as part of
      the counter-regulatory response, possibly contributing to the maintenance of
      glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Trajectory of change in brain complement factors from neonatal to young adult
      humans.
PG  - 479-493
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15241 [doi]
AB  - Immune system components also regulate synapse formation and refinement in
      neurodevelopment. The complement pathway, associated with cell lysis and
      phagocytosis, is implicated in synaptic elimination. Aberrant adolescent synaptic
      pruning may underpin schizophrenia onset; thus, changes in cortical complement
      activity during human development are of major interest. Complement is
      genetically linked to schizophrenia via increased C4 copy number variants, but
      the developmental trajectory of complement expression in the human brain is
      undetermined. As complement increases during periods of active synaptic
      engulfment in rodents, we hypothesized that complement expression would increase 
      during postnatal development in humans, particularly during adolescence. Using
      human postmortem prefrontal cortex, we observed that complement activator (C1QB
      and C3) transcripts peaked in early neurodevelopment, and were highest in
      toddlers, declining in teenagers (all ANCOVAs between F = 2.41 -3.325, p =
      .01-0.05). We found that C4 protein was higher at 1-5 years (H = 16.378, p =
      .012), whereas C3 protein levels were unchanged with age. The microglial
      complement receptor subunit CD11b increased in mRNA early in life and peaked in
      the toddler brain (ANCOVA: pH, F = 4.186, p = .003). Complement inhibitors (CD46 
      and CD55) increased at school age, but failed to decrease like complement
      activators (both ANCOVAs, F > 4.4, p < .01). These data suggest the activation of
      complement in the human prefrontal cortex occurs between 1 and 5 years. We did
      not find evidence of induction of complement factors during adolescence and
      instead found increased or sustained levels of complement inhibitor mRNA at
      maturation. Dysregulation of these typical patterns of complement may predispose 
      the brain to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or schizophrenia.

TI  - Longitudinal exploration of cancer-related cognitive impairment in patients with 
      newly diagnosed aggressive lymphoma: protocol for a feasibility study.
PG  - e038312
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038312 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a distressing and
      disabling side-effect of cancer treatments affecting up to 75% of patients. For
      some patients, their cognitive impairment may be transient, but for a subgroup,
      these symptoms can be long-standing and have a major impact on the quality of
      life. This paper describes the protocol for a study: (1) to assess the
      feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition via self-report,
      neuropsychological testing, peripheral markers of inflammation and neuroimaging
      and (2) to explore and describe patterns of cancer-related cognitive impairment
      over the course of treatment and recovery in patients with newly diagnosed,
      aggressive lymphoma undergoing standard therapy with curative intent. METHODS AND
      ANALYSIS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, feasibility study in which 30
      newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with aggressive lymphoma will be
      recruited over a 12-month period. Patients will complete comprehensive
      assessments at three time points: baseline (time 1, pre-treatment) and two
      post-baseline follow-up assessments (time 2, mid-treatment and time 3, 6-8 weeks 
      post-treatment completion). All patients will be assessed for self-reported
      cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive function using Stroop Colour and
      Word, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised,
      Controlled Oral Word Association and Digit Span. Blood cell-based inflammatory
      markers and neuroimaging including a positron emission tomography (PET) with
      (18)F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and CT ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) and a 
      MRI will explore potential inflammatory and neuroanatomical or functional
      mechanisms and biomarkers related to CRCI. The primary intent of analysis will be
      to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data on cognition using
      subjective reports and objective tasks from patients during treatment and
      recovery for lymphoma. These data will inform the design of a larger-scale
      investigation into the patterns of cognitive change over the course of treatment 
      and recovery, adding to an underexplored area of cancer survivorship research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since
      December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and
      depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly
      explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an
      immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's
      immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary
      inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the
      worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable
      immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible 
      screening actions and care that could be planned. METHOD: Data from previous
      pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric
      consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the
      risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on
      the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric
      disorders on the other hand. RESULTS: As in previous pandemics, the activation of
      the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during
      pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for
      the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in
      individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the
      risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. 
      CONCLUSION: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are
      necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals 
      who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care
      possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the
      pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the
      babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for
      possible neurodevelopmental disorders.

      register-based cohort study.
PG  - 238
LID - 10.1186/s12916-020-01709-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer patients have a highly increased risk of psychiatric disorders
      following diagnosis, compared with cancer-free individuals. Inflammation is
      involved in the development of both cancer and psychiatric disorders. The role of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the subsequent risk of
      psychiatric disorders after cancer diagnosis is however unknown. METHODS: We
      performed a cohort study of all patients diagnosed with a first primary
      malignancy between July 2006 and December 2013 in Sweden. Cox proportional
      hazards models were used to assess the association of NSAID use during the year
      before cancer diagnosis with the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related 
      disorders during the first year after cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 316,904
      patients identified, 5613 patients received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety,
      or stress-related disorders during the year after cancer diagnosis. Compared with
      no use of NSAIDs, the use of aspirin alone was associated with a lower rate of
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 0.97), whereas the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs
      alone was associated with a higher rate (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.32), after
      adjustment for sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, indications for NSAID use, 
      and cancer characteristics. The association of aspirin with reduced rate of
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders was strongest for current use
      (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93), low-dose use (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), 
      long-term use (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.94), and among patients with
      cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95) or breast cancer (HR,
      0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: Pre-diagnostic use of aspirin was
      associated with a decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related
      disorders during the first year following cancer diagnosis.

TI  - Copeptin response to hypoglycemic stress is linked to prolactin activation in
      children.
PG  - 681-690

AB  - PURPOSE: The physiological role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the acute stress
      response in humans and especially in children is unclear. The aim of this study
      was to explore the interaction between copeptin, a well-established surrogate
      marker of AVP release, and anterior pituitary hormone activation in response to
      acute hypoglycemic stress in children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted an
      exploratory single center study involving 77 children and adolescents undergoing 
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Blood levels of copeptin, ACTH, cortisol, GH,
      prolactin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined at 
      baseline and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Basal plasma levels of 
      copeptin (median: 5.2 pmol/L) increased significantly after hypoglycemia (median 
      9.7 pmol/L; P < 0.0001). Subjects with insufficient HPA axis response or severe
      GH deficiency had lower hypoglycemia-induced copeptin increase (median: 2.3
      pmol/L) compared with individuals with intact pituitary response (median: 5.2
      pmol/L, P = 0.02). Copeptin increase correlated significantly with the maximal
      increase of ACTH (rs = 0.30; P = 0.010), cortisol (rs = 0.33; P = 0.003),
      prolactin (rs = 0.25; P = 0.03), IL-6 (rs = 0.35; P = 0.008) and with BMI-SDS (rs
      = - 0.28, P = 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis, prolactin increase was 
      the only independent variable associated with copeptin increase (P = 0.0004).
      CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that: (1) hypoglycemic stress elicits a marked
      copeptin response in children and adolescents, pointing out its role as an acute 
      stress marker in this population; (2) stress-induced AVP/copeptin release is
      associated with anterior pituitary activation, mainly a prolactin response.

TI  - Interactions between perceptions of fatigue, effort, and affect decrease knee
      extensor endurance performance following upper body motor activity, independent
      of changes in neuromuscular function.
PG  - e13602
LID - 10.1111/psyp.13602 [doi]
AB  - Prior exercise has previously been shown to impair subsequent endurance
      performance in non-activated muscles. Declines in the neuromuscular function and 
      altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which
      endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus
      conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting
      mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip
      exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained,
      sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment,
      transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function
      of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the 
      first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions
      of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor
      endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance
      performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding
      handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance
      performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened
      effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the
      second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the
      neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study
      indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise
      in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional
      interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function.
      Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and
      affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance.

TI  - Inflammation as a treatment target in mood disorders: review.
PG  - e60
LID - 10.1192/bjo.2020.43 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders, i.e. major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar
      disorders, are leading sources of disability worldwide. Currently available
      treatments do not yield remission in approximately a third of patients with a
      mood disorder. This is in part because these treatments do not target a specific 
      core pathology underlying these heterogeneous disorders. In recent years,
      abnormal inflammatory processes have been identified as putative
      pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets in mood disorders,
      particularly among individuals with treatment-resistant conditions. AIMS: In this
      selective review, we aimed to summarise recent advances in the field of
      immunopsychiatry, including emerging pathophysiological models and findings from 
      treatment ttrials of immunomodulatory agents for both MDD and bipolar disorders. 
      METHOD: We performed a literature review by searching Medline for clinical trials
      of immunomodulating agents as monotherapy or adjunctive treatments in MDD and
      bipolar disorders. Included studies are randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
      cluster RCTs or cross-over trials of immunomodulating agents that had an active
      comparator or a placebo-arm. RESULTS: Current evidence shows an association
      between inflammation and mood symptoms. However, there is conflicting evidence on
      whether this link is causal. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should focus on
      identifying specific neurobiological underpinnings for the putative causal
      association between an activated inflammatory response and mood disorders.
      Results of these studies are needed before further treatment trials of
      immunomodulatory agents can be justified.

AB  - This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological
      impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the
      peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown
      measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were 
      recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data,
      physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms
      using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress
      Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms
      in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of
      psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct
      characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale 
      and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p <
      0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and
      intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than 
      healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might
      fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than
      one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe
      insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health
      status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have
      higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI
      scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological
      impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown 
      measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during
      the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a 
      new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare
      pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls
      during the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the
      Research Domain Criteria, an attempt to move beyond diagnostic categories and
      ground psychiatry within neurobiological constructs that combine different levels
      of measures (e.g., brain imaging and behavior). Statistical methods that can
      integrate such multimodal data, however, are often vulnerable to overfitting,
      poor generalization, and difficulties in interpreting the results. METHODS: We
      propose an innovative machine learning framework combining multiple holdouts and 
      a stability criterion with regularized multivariate techniques, such as sparse
      partial least squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis, for identifying 
      hidden dimensions of cross-modality relationships. To illustrate the approach, we
      investigated structural brain-behavior associations in an extensively phenotyped 
      developmental sample of 345 participants (312 healthy and 33 with clinical
      depression). The brain data consisted of whole-brain voxel-based gray matter
      volumes, and the behavioral data included item-level self-report questionnaires
      and IQ and demographic measures. RESULTS: Both sparse partial least squares and
      kernel canonical correlation analysis captured two hidden dimensions of
      brain-behavior relationships: one related to age and drinking and the other one
      related to depression. The applied machine learning framework indicates that
      these results are stable and generalize well to new data. Indeed, the identified 
      brain-behavior associations are in agreement with previous findings in the
      literature concerning age, alcohol use, and depression-related changes in brain
      volume. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate techniques (such as sparse partial least
      squares and kernel canonical correlation analysis) embedded in our novel
      framework are promising tools to link behavior and/or symptoms to neurobiology
      and thus have great potential to contribute to a biologically grounded definition
      of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression has been associated with increased inflammatory proteins, 
      but changes in circulating immune cells are less well defined. METHODS: We used
      multiparametric flow cytometry to count 14 subsets of peripheral blood cells in
      206 depression cases and 77 age- and sex-matched controls (N = 283). We used
      univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the immunophenotypes
      associated with depression and depression severity. RESULTS: Depression cases,
      compared with controls, had significantly increased immune cell counts,
      especially neutrophils, CD4(+) T cells, and monocytes, and increased inflammatory
      proteins (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Within-group analysis of cases
      demonstrated significant associations between the severity of depressive symptoms
      and increased myeloid and CD4(+) T-cell counts. Depression cases were partitioned
      into 2 subgroups by forced binary clustering of cell counts: the inflamed
      depression subgroup (n = 81 out of 206; 39%) had increased monocyte, CD4(+), and 
      neutrophil counts; increased C-reactive protein and interleukin-6; and more
      severe depression than the uninflamed majority of cases. Relaxing the presumption
      of a binary classification, data-driven analysis identified 4 subgroups of
      depression cases, 2 of which (n = 38 and n = 100; 67% collectively) were
      associated with increased inflammatory proteins and more severe depression but
      differed in terms of myeloid and lymphoid cell counts. Results were robust to
      potentially confounding effects of age, sex, body mass index, recent infection,
      and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral immune cell counts were used to
      distinguish inflamed and uninflamed subgroups of depression and to indicate that 
      there may be mechanistically distinct subgroups of inflamed depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses confirm increased circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) 
      levels in depression. Longitudinal studies have linked one-off measurements of
      CRP at baseline with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms
      subsequently at follow-up, but studies with repeat CRP measures from the same
      individuals are scarce. METHODS: We have examined whether longitudinal patterns
      of inflammation, based on three CRP measurements from childhood to
      early-adulthood, are associated with the risk of depression in early-adulthood in
      the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort. 
      RESULTS: Using Gaussian mixture modelling of available CRP data from age 9, 15
      and 18 years, we identified four population clusters/sub-groups reflecting
      different longitudinal patterns of CRP: persistently low (N=463, 29.5%);
      persistently high (N=371, 24%); decreasing (N=360, 23%); increasing (N=367,
      23.5%). The increasing group showed a steep increase in CRP levels between
      adolescence and early-adulthood. Participants in this group had a higher risk of 
      moderate/severe depression at age 18 years, compared with those with persistently
      low CRP; adjusted odds ratio (OR)=3.78 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.46-9.81; 
      p=0.006). The odds of moderate/severe depression were also increased for the
      persistently high CRP group, but this was not statistically significant; OR=2.54 
      (95% CI, 0.90-7.16). LIMITATIONS: Repeat CRP measures were available for a
      subset, who may not be representative of all cohort participants. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results suggest that an increasing pattern of inflammation from adolescence
      to early-adulthood is associated with risk of depression in early-adulthood.

TI  - Effects of immunomodulatory drugs on depressive symptoms: A mega-analysis of
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in inflammatory disorders.

AB  - Activation of the innate immune system is commonly associated with depression.
      Immunomodulatory drugs may have efficacy for depressive symptoms that are
      co-morbidly associated with inflammatory disorders. We report a large-scale
      re-analysis by standardized procedures (mega-analysis) of patient-level data
      combined from 18 randomized clinical trials conducted by Janssen or
      GlaxoSmithKline for one of nine disorders (N = 10,743 participants). Core
      depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia) were measured by the Short Form Survey 
      (SF-36) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and participants
      were stratified into high (N = 1921) versus low-depressive strata based on
      baseline ratings. Placebo-controlled change from baseline after 4-16 weeks of
      treatment was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) over all trials
      and for each subgroup of trials targeting one of 7 mechanisms (IL-6, TNF-alpha,
      IL-12/23, CD20, COX2, BLgammaS, p38/MAPK14). Patients in the high depressive
      stratum showed modest but significant effects on core depressive symptoms (SMD = 
      0.29, 95% CI [0.12-0.45]) and related SF-36 measures of mental health and
      vitality. Anti-IL-6 antibodies (SMD = 0.8, 95% CI [0.20-1.41]) and an
      anti-IL-12/23 antibody (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI [0.26-0.70]) had larger effects on
      depressive symptoms than other drug classes. Adjustments for physical health
      outcome marginally attenuated the average treatment effect on depressive symptoms
      (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.35), but more strongly attenuated effects on mental
      health and vitality. Effects of anti-IL-12/23 remained significant and anti-IL-6 
      antibodies became a trend after controlling for physical response to treatment.
      Novel immune-therapeutics can produce antidepressant effects in depressed
      patients with primary inflammatory disorders that are not entirely explained by
      treatment-related changes in physical health.

      people.
PG  - 11536
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-47277-3 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how variations in dimensions of psychometrics, IQ and demographics 
      relate to changes in brain connectivity during the critical developmental period 
      of adolescence and early adulthood is a major challenge. This has particular
      relevance for mental health disorders where a failure to understand these links
      might hinder the development of better diagnostic approaches and therapeutics.
      Here, we investigated this question in 306 adolescents and young adults (14-24 y,
      25 clinically depressed) using a multivariate statistical framework, based on
      canonical correlation analysis (CCA). By linking individual functional brain
      connectivity profiles to self-report questionnaires, IQ and demographic data we
      identified two distinct modes of covariation. The first mode mapped onto an
      externalization/internalization axis and showed a strong association with sex.
      The second mode mapped onto a well-being/distress axis independent of sex.
      Interestingly, both modes showed an association with age. Crucially, the changes 
      in functional brain connectivity associated with changes in these phenotypes
      showed marked developmental effects. The findings point to a role for the default
      mode, frontoparietal and limbic networks in psychopathology and depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral low-grade inflammation in depression is increasingly seen 
      as a therapeutic target. We aimed to establish the prevalence of low-grade
      inflammation in depression, using different C-reactive protein (CRP) levels,
      through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched
      the PubMed database from its inception to July 2018, and selected studies that
      assessed depression using a validated tool/scale, and allowed the calculation of 
      the proportion of patients with low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) or elevated 
      CRP (>1 mg/L). RESULTS: After quality assessment, 37 studies comprising 13 541
      depressed patients and 155 728 controls were included. Based on the meta-analysis
      of 30 studies, the prevalence of low-grade inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) in
      depression was 27% (95% CI 21-34%); this prevalence was not associated with
      sample source (inpatient, outpatient or population-based), antidepressant
      treatment, participant age, BMI or ethnicity. Based on the meta-analysis of 17
      studies of depression and matched healthy controls, the odds ratio for low-grade 
      inflammation in depression was 1.46 (95% CI 1.22-1.75). The prevalence of
      elevated CRP (>1 mg/L) in depression was 58% (95% CI 47-69%), and the
      meta-analytic odds ratio for elevated CRP in depression compared with controls
      was 1.47 (95% CI 1.18-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of patients with
      depression show evidence of low-grade inflammation, and over half of patients
      show mildly elevated CRP levels. There are significant differences in the
      prevalence of low-grade inflammation between patients and matched healthy
      controls. These findings suggest that inflammation could be relevant to a large
      number of patients with depression.

AB  - The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a period when ongoing brain
      development coincides with a substantially increased risk of psychiatric
      disorders. The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent
      psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal 
      dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI
      scans, we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide
      growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical
      white matter. In this healthy population, the expression of common developmental 
      traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these
      MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in
      dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral
      and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that
      psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally
      specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain
      development.

AB  - The discovery that prolonged administration of interferon-alpha (a
      pro-inflammatory cytokine) readily precipitates depressive symptoms has played a 
      key role in development of the inflammation theory of major depressive disorder
      (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients
      with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with, or can be
      distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we
      explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients
      undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition 
      to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The
      resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6
      previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al., 2004). This confirmatory
      factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our
      interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described
      for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead, subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a 
      distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive
      symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 15). The second
      sleep disorder factor (items 4, 5, 6) replicated previous findings in
      'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and
      function (items 7, 12, 13, 14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in
      idiopathic depression studies), grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss
      (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3, 8, and 17) were excluded from
      analysis due to very low variance. At transition, interferon-alpha induced major 
      depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features
      that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low
      likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this
      clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression
      etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized
      therapies.

AB  - Schizophrenia has been conceived as a disorder of brain connectivity, but it is
      unclear how this network phenotype is related to the underlying genetics. We used
      morphometric similarity analysis of MRI data as a marker of interareal cortical
      connectivity in three prior case-control studies of psychosis: in total, n = 185 
      cases and n = 227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced
      morphometric similarity in all three studies. There was also a replicable pattern
      of case-control differences in regional morphometric similarity, which was
      significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas but
      increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data, we
      found that the cortical map of case-control differences in morphometric
      similarity was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted
      combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms and
      pathways. In addition, genes that were normally overexpressed in cortical areas
      with reduced morphometric similarity were significantly up-regulated in three
      prior post mortem studies of schizophrenia. We propose that this combined
      analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides insight into how
      previously implicated genes and proteins as well as a number of unreported genes 
      in their topological vicinity on the protein interaction network may drive
      structural brain network changes mediating the genetic risk of schizophrenia.

AB  - A mechanistic understanding of the pathology of psychiatric disorders has been
      hampered by extensive heterogeneity in biology, symptoms, and behavior within
      diagnostic categories that are defined subjectively. We investigated whether
      leveraging individual differences in information-processing impairments in
      patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could reveal phenotypes
      within the disorder. We found that a subgroup of patients with PTSD from two
      independent cohorts displayed both aberrant functional connectivity within the
      ventral attention network (VAN) as revealed by functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging and impaired verbal memory on a word list learning
      task. This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or 
      comorbidities, but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to
      psychotherapy, the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal
      noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we then
      identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by
      direct stimulation of that network. These alterations were associated with
      individual differences in functional fMRI connectivity within the VAN. Our
      findings define specific neurobiological mechanisms in a subgroup of patients
      with PTSD that could contribute to the poor response to psychotherapy.

TI  - Inflammation and Depression: A Nervous Plea for Psychiatry to Not Become Immune
      to Interpretation.
LID - E29 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph12010029 [doi]
AB  - The possibility that inflammation plays a causal role in major depression is an
      important claim in the emerging field of immunopsychiatry and has generated hope 
      for new treatments. The aims of the present review are first to provide some
      historical background and to consider the evidence in favor of the claim that
      inflammation is causally involved in major depression. The second part discusses 
      some of the possibilities allowed for by the use of broad 'umbrella' concepts,
      such as inflammation and stress, in terms of proposing new working hypotheses and
      potential mechanisms. The third part reviews proposed biomarkers of inflammation 
      and depression and the final part addresses how elements discussed in the
      preceding sections are used in immunopsychiatry. The 'umbrella' concepts of
      inflammation and stress, as well as insufficiently-met criteria based inferences 
      and reverse inferences are being used to some extent in immunopsychiatry. The
      field is therefore encouraged to specify concepts and constructs, as well as to
      consider potential alternative interpretations and explanations for findings
      obtained. The hope is that pointing out some of the potential problems will allow
      for a clearer picture of immunopsychiatry's current strengths and limitations and
      help the field mature.

TI  - Change, stability, and instability in the Pavlovian guidance of behaviour from
      adolescence to young adulthood.
PG  - e1006679
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006679 [doi]
AB  - Pavlovian influences are important in guiding decision-making across health and
      psychopathology. There is an increasing interest in using concise computational
      tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations, and especially to
      track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However,
      the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain, a problem
      compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements.
      We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well
      characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of 
      Pavlovian influences and other 'psychomarkers' guiding decision-making would
      behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as
      precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task, we expected this
      influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally, we hypothesized it
      would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian
      effects had weak temporal stability, while model-fit was more stable. In terms of
      external validity, Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience 
      within the task, in line with normative expectations. However, Pavlovian effects 
      were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus, although this
      computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development, it
      does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We
      suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived
      Pavlovian measures for future studies.

LID - 10.1016/j.bbi.2018.11.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-grade inflammation is associated with depression, but studies of 
      specific symptoms are relatively scarce. Association between inflammatory markers
      and specific symptoms may provide insights into potential mechanism of
      inflammation-related depression. Using longitudinal data, we have tested whether 
      childhood serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are
      associated with specific depressive symptoms in early adulthood. METHODS: In the 
      ALSPAC birth cohort, serum IL-6 and CRP levels were assessed at age 9years and 19
      depressive symptoms were assessed at age 18years. We used modified Poisson
      generalised linear regression with robust error variance to estimate the risk
      ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each depressive symptom. In
      addition, we used confirmatory factor analysis to create two continuous latent
      variables representing somatic/neurovegetative and psychological dimension
      scores. Structural equation modelling was used to test the associations between
      IL-6 and these dimension scores. RESULTS: Based on data from 2731 participants,
      IL-6 was associated with diurnal mood variation, concentration difficulties,
      fatigue and sleep disturbances. The adjusted RRs for these symptoms at age
      18years for participants in top, compared with bottom, third of IL-6 at age
      9years were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.13-2.69) for diurnal mood variation, 1.50 (95% CI,
      1.11-2.02) for concentration difficulties, 1.31 (95% CI, 1.12-1.54) for fatigue, 
      and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.01-1.52) for sleep disturbances. At dimension level, IL-6 was
      associated with both somatic/neurovegetative (beta=0.059, SE=0.024, P=0.013) and 
      psychological (beta=0.056, SE=0.023, P=0.016) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation
      is associated with specific symptoms of depression. Associations with so-called
      somatic/neurovegetative symptoms of depression such as fatigue, sleep
      disturbances and diurnal mood variation indicate that these symptoms could be
      useful treatment targets and markers of treatment response in clinical trials of 
      anti-inflammatory treatment for depression.

AB  - With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric
      disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and
      assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it
      has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of
      birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
      (n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
      model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical
      areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty,
      peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter
      development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
      age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth
      trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association
      cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices.
      Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most
      heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones
      and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of
      high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and
      importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
      to environmental impact.

TI  - Sex-specific impact of prenatal androgens on social brain default mode
      subsystems.
PG  - 2175-2188
LID - 10.1038/s41380-018-0198-y [doi]
AB  - Early-onset neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism) affect males more
      frequently than females. Androgens may play a role in this male-bias by
      sex-differentially impacting early prenatal brain development, particularly
      neural circuits that later develop specialized roles in social cognition. Here,
      we find that increasing prenatal testosterone in humans is associated with later 
      reduction of functional connectivity between social brain default mode (DMN)
      subsystems in adolescent males, but has no effect in females. Since testosterone 
      can work directly via the androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly via the estrogen
      receptor through aromatase conversion to estradiol, we further examined how a
      potent non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), acts via the AR to
      influence gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC)-particularly for
      genes of high-relevance for DMN circuitry. DHT dysregulates a number of genes
      enriched for syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability and for genes
      that in later development are expressed in anatomical patterns that highly
      correspond to the cortical midline DMN subsystem. DMN-related and DHT-affected
      genes (e.g., MEF2C) are involved in a number of synaptic processes, many of which
      impact excitation-inhibition balance. Androgens have male-specific prenatal
      influence over social brain circuitry in humans and may be relevant towards
      explaining some component of male-bias in early-onset neurodevelopmental
      conditions.

TI  - Association between cytokines and psychiatric symptoms in chronic fatigue
      syndrome and healthy controls.
PG  - 556-560
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2018.1493747 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The reports regarding the status of the immune system in patients with
      chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have been inconclusive. 
      We approached this question by comparing a strictly defined group of CFS/ME
      outpatients to healthy control individuals, and thereafter studied cytokines in
      subgroups with various psychiatric symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty
      patients diagnosed with CFS/ME according to the Fukuda criteria and 20 age- and
      sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Plasma was analysed by
      ELISA for levels of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10. Participants
      also answered questionnaires regarding health in general, and psychiatric
      symptoms in detail. RESULTS: Increased plasma levels of TNF-alpha in CFS/ME
      patients almost reached significance compared to healthy controls (p = .056).
      When studying the CFS/ME and control groups separately, there was a significant
      correlation between TNF-alpha and The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS) depressive symptoms in controls only, not in the CFS/ME group. A
      correlation between IL-10 and psychoticism was found in both groups, whereas the 
      correlation for somatisation was seen only in the CFS/ME group. When looking at
      the total population, there was a significant correlation between TNF-alpha and
      both the HADS depressive symptoms and the SCL-90-R cluster somatisation. Also,
      there was a significant association between IL-10 and the SCL-90-R cluster
      somatisation when analyzing the cohort (patients and controls together).
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that immune activity in CFS/ME patients
      deviates from that of healthy controls, which implies potential pathogenic
      mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches to CFS/ME. More comprehensive
      studies should be carried out on defined CFS/ME subgroups.

AB  - This meta-analytic review evaluated the effectiveness of depression interventions
      on the psychological and immunological outcomes of people living with HIV in
      sub-Saharan Africa. 14 studies, yielding 932 participants were eligible. A
      random-effects models indicated that depression interventions were followed by
      large reductions in depression scores (effect size=1.86, 95% CI=1.71, 2.01,
      p<0.01). No significant effect on immune outcome was observed, however there was 
      a trend toward immune improvement of medium effect size (effect size on CD4 count
      and/or viral suppression=0.57, 95% CI=-0.06, 1.20, p=0.08). Pharmacological
      interventions appeared to have a significantly larger improvement in depression
      scores than psychological interventions. The greatest improvement in immune
      status was demonstrated in psychological treatments which incorporated a
      component to enhance HIV medication adherence, however these results did not
      reach significance. Small sample sizes and highly heterogeneous analysis
      necessitate caution in interpretation. The results of this meta-analysis should
      thus be treated as preliminary evidence and used to encourage further studies of 
      immunopsychiatry in HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of acute hypoglycemia on markers of inflammation have
      been investigated, but the results have been heterogeneous. OBJECTIVE: We aimed
      to perform a systematic review about the acute effects of insulin-induced
      hypoglycemia on inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes as well as
      non-diabetic subjects. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature using the
      electronic databases MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted through September 2017.
      Search terms included: "hypoglycemia"," insulin", "cytokines", and
      "inflammation". We included original studies assessing peripheral inflammatory
      markers during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans. RESULTS: Two hundred
      twenty-two citations were initially retrieved. Eleven studies were included in
      our systematic review. Acute hypoglycemia increases total leukocyte number and
      several pro-inflammatory markers. Elevation in pro-inflammatory markers in
      response to insulin-induced acute hypoglycemia appears to be of similar magnitude
      in non-diabetic subjects and in type-1 diabetic patients with intact awareness of
      hypoglycemia. Adrenaline rises in response to acute hypoglycemia correlates with 
      the increase of pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Acute hypoglycemia induces 
      a pro-inflammatory state in both type-1 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with
      no apparent significant difference between these two populations. Activation of
      the sympathetic nervous system is a likely mediator of these effects.

AB  - The link between systemic autoimmunity, brain pathology, and aberrant behavior is
      still a largely unexplored field of biomedical science. Accumulating evidence
      points to causal relationships between immune factors, neurodegeneration, and
      neuropsychiatric manifestations. By documenting autoimmunity-associated neuronal 
      degeneration and cytotoxicity of the cerebrospinal fluid from disease-affected
      subjects, the murine MRL model had shown high validity in revealing principal
      pathogenic circuits. In addition, unlike any other autoimmune strain, MRL mice
      produce antibodies commonly found in patients suffering from lupus and other
      autoimmune disorders. This review highlights importance of the MRL model as a
      useful preparation in understanding the links between immune system and brain
      function.

AB  - Human brain networks based on neuroimaging data have already proven useful in
      characterizing both normal and abnormal brain structure and function. However,
      many brain disorders are neurodevelopmental in origin, highlighting the need to
      go beyond characterizing brain organization in terms of static networks. Here, we
      review the fast-growing literature shedding light on developmental changes in
      network phenotypes. We begin with an overview of recent large-scale efforts to
      map healthy brain development, and we describe the key role played by
      longitudinal data including repeated measurements over a long period of
      follow-up. We also discuss the subtle ways in which healthy brain network
      development can inform our understanding of disorders, including work bridging
      the gap between macroscopic neuroimaging results and the microscopic level.
      Finally, we turn to studies of three specific neurodevelopmental disorders that
      first manifest primarily in childhood and adolescence/early adulthood, namely
      psychotic disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism
      spectrum disorder. In each case we discuss recent progress in understanding the
      atypical features of brain network development associated with the disorder, and 
      we conclude the review with some suggestions for future directions.

TI  - Systemic inflammation and intelligence in early adulthood and subsequent risk of 
      schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses: a longitudinal cohort and
      co-relative study.
PG  - 295-302
LID - 10.1017/S0033291718000831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with impaired neurodevelopment as indexed
      by lower premorbid IQ. We examined associations between erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR), a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation, IQ, and subsequent
      schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (ONAP) to elucidate the role of
      neurodevelopment and inflammation in the pathogenesis of psychosis. METHODS:
      Population-based data on ESR and IQ from 638 213 Swedish men assessed during
      military conscription between 1969 and 1983 were linked to National Hospital
      Discharge Register for hospitalisation with schizophrenia and ONAP. The
      associations of ESR with IQ (cross-sectional) and psychoses (longitudinal) were
      investigated using linear and Cox-regression. The co-relative analysis was used
      to examine effects of shared familial confounding. We examined mediation and
      moderation of effect between ESR and IQ on psychosis risk. RESULTS: Baseline IQ
      was associated with subsequent risk of schizophrenia (adjusted HR per 1-point
      increase in IQ = 0.961; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960-0.963) and ONAP
      (adjusted HR = 0.973; 95% CI 0.971-0.975). Higher ESR was associated with lower
      IQ in a dose-response fashion. High ESR was associated with increased risk for
      schizophrenia (adjusted HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28) and decreased risk for ONAP 
      (adjusted HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.96), although these effects were specific to
      one ESR band (7-10 mm/hr). Familial confounding explained ESR-IQ but not
      ESR-psychoses associations. IQ partly mediated the ESR-psychosis relationships.
      CONCLUSIONS: Lower IQ is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and with
      an increased risk of schizophrenia and ONAP in adulthood. Low-grade inflammation 
      may influence schizophrenia risk by affecting neurodevelopment. Future studies
      should explore the differential effects of inflammation on different types of
      psychosis.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of neural and immune disorders, their etiology and
      molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. As the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is 
      increasingly utilized as a powerful model organism in biomedical research,
      mounting evidence suggests these fish as a useful tool to study neural and immune
      mechanisms and their interplay. Here, we discuss zebrafish neuro-immune
      mechanisms and their pharmacological and genetic modulation, the effect of stress
      on cytokines, as well as relevant models of microbiota-brain interplay. As many
      human brain diseases are based on complex interplay between the neural and the
      immune system, here we discuss zebrafish models, as well as recent successes and 
      challenges, in this rapidly expanding field. We particularly emphasize the
      growing utility of zebrafish models in translational immunopsychiatry research,
      as they improve our understanding of pathogenetic neuro-immune interactions,
      thereby fostering future discovery of potential therapeutic agents.

AB  - Low-grade inflammation is a risk factor for depression, psychosis and other major
      psychiatric disorders. It is associated with poor response to antidepressant and 
      antipsychotics, and could potentially be a treatment target. However, there is
      limited data on the prevalence of low-grade inflammation in major psychiatric
      disorders, and on the characteristics of patients who show evidence of
      inflammation. We examined the prevalence of low-grade inflammation and associated
      socio-demographic and clinical factors in acute psychiatric inpatients. An
      anonymised search of the electronic patient records of Cambridgeshire and
      Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust was used to identify patients aged 18-65years
      who were hospitalised between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive). We excluded patients on 
      antibiotics or oral steroids, or with missing data. Inflammation was defined
      using serum C-reactive protein (>3mg/L) or total white cell count (>9.4x10(9)/L) 
      as measured within 14days of admission. Out of all 599 admissions, the prevalence
      of inflammation (serum CRP >3mg/L) in the ICD-10 diagnostic groups of psychotic
      disorders (F20-29), mood disorders (F30-39), neurotic disorders (F40-48) and
      personality disorders (F60-69) was 32%, 21%, 22% and 42%, respectively. In
      multivariable analyses, low-grade inflammation was associated with older age,
      black ethnicity, being single, self-harm, diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, current treatments with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and with
      current treatment for medical comorbidities. A notable proportion of acutely
      unwell psychiatric patients from all ICD-10 major diagnostic groups show evidence
      of low-grade inflammation, suggesting inflammation may be relevant for all
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Differences in cortical morphology-in particular, cortical volume, thickness and 
      surface area-have been reported in individuals with autism. However, it is
      unclear what aspects of genetic and transcriptomic variation are associated with 
      these differences. Here we investigate the genetic correlates of global cortical 
      thickness differences (DeltaCT) in children with autism. We used Partial Least
      Squares Regression (PLSR) on structural MRI data from 548 children (166 with
      autism, 295 neurotypical children and 87 children with ADHD) and cortical gene
      expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science to identify genetic
      correlates of DeltaCT in autism. We identify that these genes are enriched for
      synaptic transmission pathways and explain significant variation in DeltaCT.
      These genes are also significantly enriched for genes dysregulated in the autism 
      post-mortem cortex (Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.11, Pcorrected 10(-14)), driven entirely
      by downregulated genes (OR = 1.87, Pcorrected 10(-15)). We validated the
      enrichment for downregulated genes in two independent data sets: Validation 1 (OR
      = 1.44, Pcorrected = 0.004) and Validation 2 (OR = 1.30; Pcorrected = 0.001). We 
      conclude that transcriptionally downregulated genes implicated in autism are
      robustly associated with global changes in cortical thickness variability in
      children with autism.

TI  - Effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on the expression of tryptophan-metabolism
      genes by human macrophages.
PG  - 681-692
LID - 10.1002/JLB.3A0617-261R [doi]
AB  - Several lines of evidence link macrophage activation and inflammation with
      (monoaminergic) nervous systems in the etiology of depression. IFN treatment is
      associated with depressive symptoms, whereas anti-TNFalpha therapies elicit
      positive mood. This study describes the actions of 2 monoaminergic
      antidepressants (escitalopram, nortriptyline) and 3 anti-inflammatory drugs
      (indomethacin, prednisolone, and anti-TNFalpha antibody) on the response of human
      monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from 6 individuals to LPS or IFN-alpha.
      Expression profiling revealed robust changes in the MDM transcriptome (3294 genes
      at P < 0.001) following LPS challenge, whereas a more limited subset of genes
      (499) responded to IFNalpha. Contrary to published reports, administered at
      nontoxic doses, neither monoaminergic antidepressant significantly modulated the 
      transcriptional response to either inflammatory challenge. Each anti-inflammatory
      drug had a distinct impact on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and on the
      profile of inducible gene expression-notably on the regulation of enzymes
      involved in metabolism of tryptophan. Inter alia, the effect of anti-TNFalpha
      antibody confirmed a predicted autocrine stimulatory loop in human macrophages.
      The transcriptional changes were predictive of tryptophan availability and
      kynurenine synthesis, as analyzed by targeted metabolomic studies on cellular
      supernatants. We suggest that inflammatory processes in the brain or periphery
      could impact on depression by altering the availability of tryptophan for
      serotonin synthesis and/or by increasing production of neurotoxic kynurenine.

AB  - Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central 
      scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is
      based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of
      influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change 
      score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease
      apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and
      behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that
      naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can
      even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement
      occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a 
      lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204 (N=32 imaging) on two waves) we 
      observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a
      high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, 
      N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than 
      in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we 
      provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers 
      in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and Omeganyx).

AB  - Functional connectomes are commonly analysed as sparse graphs, constructed by
      thresholding cross-correlations between regional neurophysiological signals.
      Thresholding generally retains the strongest edges (correlations), either by
      retaining edges surpassing a given absolute weight, or by constraining the edge
      density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive
      edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge
      densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods, which enable construction of 
      probabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type I error, to a dataset of
      resting-state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy
      controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value, we found
      that functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more dysconnected
      than those of healthy controls, exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher
      number of (dis)connected components. Furthermore, many participants' connectomes 
      could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the
      literature ( approximately 5-30%), while controlling for type I error.
      Additionally, we showed that the topological randomisation previously reported in
      the schizophrenia literature is likely attributable to "non-significant" edges
      added when thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation.
      Finally, by explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value
      and decreasing correlation, we showed that probabilistically thresholded
      connectomes show decreased randomness and increased consistency across
      participants. Our results have implications for future analysis of functional
      connectivity using graph theory, especially within datasets exhibiting
      heterogenous distributions of edge weights (correlations), between groups or
      across participants.

AB  - Macroscopic cortical networks are important for cognitive function, but it
      remains challenging to construct anatomically plausible individual structural
      connectomes from human neuroimaging. We introduce a new technique for cortical
      network mapping based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric
      parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one
      macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have
      a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human
      MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater 
      inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger
      inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing
      macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was
      related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN
      nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric 
      similarity mapping provides a novel, robust, and biologically plausible approach 
      to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in
      psychological functions.

AB  - Complex network topology is characteristic of many biological systems, including 
      anatomical and functional brain networks (connectomes). Here, we first
      constructed a structural covariance network from MRI measures of cortical
      thickness on 296 healthy volunteers, aged 14-24 years. Next, we designed a new
      algorithm for matching sample locations from the Allen Brain Atlas to the nodes
      of the SCN. Subsequently we used this to define, transcriptomic brain networks by
      estimating gene co-expression between pairs of cortical regions. Finally, we
      explored the hypothesis that transcriptional networks and structural MRI
      connectomes are coupled. A transcriptional brain network (TBN) and a structural
      covariance network (SCN) were correlated across connection weights and showed
      qualitatively similar complex topological properties: assortativity,
      small-worldness, modularity, and a rich-club. In both networks, the weight of an 
      edge was inversely related to the anatomical (Euclidean) distance between
      regions. There were differences between networks in degree and distance
      distributions: the transcriptional network had a less fat-tailed degree
      distribution and a less positively skewed distance distribution than the SCN.
      However, cortical areas connected to each other within modules of the SCN had
      significantly higher levels of whole genome co-expression than expected by
      chance. Nodes connected in the SCN had especially high levels of expression and
      co-expression of a human supragranular enriched (HSE) gene set that has been
      specifically located to supragranular layers of human cerebral cortex and is
      known to be important for large-scale, long-distance cortico-cortical
      connectivity. This coupling of brain transcriptome and connectome topologies was 
      largely but not entirely accounted for by the common constraint of physical
      distance on both networks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels are commonly elevated in patients with
      depression and psychosis and in people who are at risk of developing these
      disorders. A common, functional variant in the IL6R gene (IL6R Asp358Ala;
      rs2228145 A>C) is known to dampen down inflammation by impairing IL6R signaling. 
      We have examined the association of Asp358Ala with diagnosis of depression and
      psychosis, serum IL-6, CRP levels, and a number of risk factors commonly linked
      with inflammation, depression or psychosis. We predicted that if IL-6 were
      related to depression/psychosis risk causally, rather than due to confounding,
      Asp358Ala would be associated with risk of these disorders, serum IL-6, CRP
      levels, but not with any of the confounders. METHOD: We used data from the
      population-based ALSPAC birth cohort. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels were measured at 
      age 9years. Psychotic disorder, ICD-10 diagnosis of severe depressive episode,
      and total depression score were assessed at age 18years. IL6R Asp358Ala was
      genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping
      platform. Risk factors assessed include sex, body mass index, social class,
      ethnicity, maternal education, birth weight, gestational age, maternal post-natal
      depression, childhood psychological and behavioral problems, and total IQ score. 
      RESULTS: Asp358Ala was associated with decreased risk of severe depression and/or
      psychosis; adjusted odds ratio for those with CC, compared with AA, genotype was 
      0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.94). The variant was associated with increased serum IL-6
      levels (P=5.5x10(-22)) but decreased serum CRP levels (P=3.5x10(-5)), consistent 
      with an anti-inflammatory effect downstream of IL-6. Asp358Ala was not associated
      with total depression score. Asp358Ala was not associated with any of the other
      risk factors commonly linked with inflammation, depression or psychosis (all
      P>0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide further evidence that the IL-6/IL6R
      pathways are involved in pathogenesis of severe depression and psychosis, and may
      be novel therapeutic targets. Previously reported associations between IL-6,
      depression and psychosis are unlikely to be fully explained by confounding. Based
      on a small number of cases, findings from the current study need replication in
      other samples.

TI  - Childhood inflammatory markers and intelligence as predictors of subsequent
      persistent depressive symptoms: a longitudinal cohort study.
PG  - 1514-1522
LID - 10.1017/S0033291717003038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms during
      the second decade of life, a critical period of brain development, using data
      from a prospective birth cohort. To test whether childhood intelligence and
      inflammatory markers are associated with subsequent persistent depressive
      symptoms. METHODS: IQ, a proxy for neurodevelopment, was measured at age 8 years.
      Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, typical inflammatory markers, were
      measured at age 9 years. Depressive symptoms were measured six times between 10
      and 19 years using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ), which were
      coded as binary variable and then used in latent class analysis to identify
      developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Longitudinal SMFQ data 
      from 9156 participants yielded three distinct population sub-groups of depressive
      symptoms: no symptoms (81.2%); adolescent-onset symptoms (13.2%); persistent
      symptoms (5.6%). Lower IQ and higher IL-6 levels in childhood were independently 
      associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms in a linear,
      dose-response fashion, but not with adolescent-onset symptoms. Compared with the 
      group with no symptoms the adjusted odds ratio for persistent depressive symptoms
      per s.d. increase in IQ was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95); that for IL-6 was 1.20 (95%
      CI, 1.03-1.39). Evidence for an association with IL-6 remained after controlling 
      for initial severity of depressive symptoms at 10 years. There was no evidence
      that IL-6 moderated or mediated the IQ-persistent depressive symptom
      relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate potentially important roles for
      two distinct biological processes, neurodevelopment and inflammation, in the
      aetiology of persistent depressive symptoms in young people.

AB  - The blood-brain interface (BBI) is the subject of a new named series at Brain,
      Behavior, and Immunity. It is timely to reflect on a number of advances in the
      field within the last ten years, which may lead to an increased understanding of 
      human behaviour and a wide range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. We
      cover discoveries made in solute and cell trafficking, endothelial cell and
      pericyte biology, extracellular matrix and emerging tools, especially those which
      will enable study of the human BBI. We now recognize the central role of the BBI 
      in a number of immunopsychiatric syndromes, including sickness behaviour,
      delirium, septic encephalopathy, cognitive side effects of cytokine-based
      therapies and the frank psychosis observed in neuronal surface antibody
      syndromes. In addition, we find ourselves interrogating and modulating the brain 
      across the BBI, during diagnostic investigation and treatment of brain disease.
      The past ten years of BBI research have been exciting but there is more to come.

TI  - Interferon-Alpha Reduces Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Increases Apoptosis
      via Activation of Distinct STAT1-Dependent Mechanisms.
PG  - 187-200
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyx083 [doi]
AB  - Background: In humans, interferon-alpha treatment for chronic viral hepatitis is 
      a well-recognized clinical model for inflammation-induced depression, but the
      molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. Following peripheral
      administration in rodents, interferon-alpha induces signal transducer and
      activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) within the hippocampus and disrupts
      hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods: We used the human hippocampal progenitor cell 
      line HPC0A07/03C to evaluate the effects of 2 concentrations of interferon-alpha,
      similar to those observed in human serum during its therapeutic use (500 pg/mL
      and 5000 pg/mL), on neurogenesis and apoptosis. Results: Both concentrations of
      interferon-alpha decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, with the high concentration 
      also increasing apoptosis. Moreover, interferon-alpha increased the expression of
      interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18),
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) via activation of STAT1. Like interferon-alpha,
      co-treatment with a combination of ISG15, USP18, and IL-6 was able to reduce
      neurogenesis and enhance apoptosis via further downstream activation of STAT1.
      Further experiments showed that ISG15 and USP18 mediated the
      interferon-alpha-induced reduction in neurogenesis (potentially through
      upregulation of the ISGylation-related proteins UBA7, UBE2L6, and HERC5), while
      IL-6 mediated the interferon-alpha-induced increase in apoptosis (potentially
      through downregulation of aquaporin 4). Using transcriptomic analyses, we showed 
      that interferon-alpha regulated pathways involved in oxidative stress and immune 
      response (e.g., Nuclear Factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 [Nrf2] and interferon
      regulatory factor [IRF] signaling pathway), neuronal formation (e.g., CAMP
      response element-binding protein [CREB] signaling), and cell death regulation
      (e.g., tumor protein(p)53 signaling). Conclusions: We identify novel molecular
      mechanisms mediating the effects of interferon-alpha on the human hippocampus
      potentially involved in inflammation-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms.

      among older adults.
PG  - e1208
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.155 [doi]
AB  - Evidence on systemic inflammation as a risk factor for future depression is
      inconsistent, possibly due to a lack of regard for persistency of exposure. We
      examined whether being inflamed on multiple occasions increases risk of new
      depressive symptoms using prospective data from a population-based sample of
      adults aged 50 years or older (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing).
      Participants with less than four of eight depressive symptoms in 2004/05 and
      2008/09 based on the Eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale
      were analysed. The number of occasions with C-reactive protein 3 mg l(-1) over
      the same initial assessments (1 vs 0 occasion, and 2 vs 0 occasions) was examined
      in relation to change in depressive symptoms between 2008/09 and 2012/13 and odds
      of developing depressive symptomology (having more than or equal to four of eight
      symptoms) in 2012/13. In multivariable-adjusted regression models (n=2068),
      participants who were inflamed on 1 vs 0 occasion showed no increase in
      depressive symptoms nor raised odds of developing depressive symptomology; those 
      inflamed on 2 vs 0 occasions showed a 0.10 (95% confidence intervals (CIs)=-0.07,
      0.28) symptom increase and 1.60 (95% CI=1.00, 2.55) times higher odds. In further
      analyses, 2 vs 0 occasions of inflammation were associated with increased odds of
      developing depressive symptoms among women (odds ratio (OR)=2.75, 95% CI=1.53,
      4.95), but not among men (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.29, 1.68); P-for-sex
      interaction=0.035. In this cohort study of older adults, repeated but not
      transient exposure to systemic inflammation was associated with increased risk of
      future depressive symptoms among women; this subgroup finding requires
      confirmation of validity.

      Development During Late Adolescence and Early Adulthood.

AB  - One of the most replicable findings in psychology is the positive manifold: the
      observation that individual differences in cognitive abilities are universally
      positively correlated. Investigating the developmental origin of the positive
      manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of
      adolescents and young adults ( N = 785; n = 566 across two waves, mean interval
      between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14-25 years), we examined developmental
      changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used
      bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of
      cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We
      showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities
      directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of
      developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary
      showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling
      pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic
      window into cognitive development.

TI  - Replicable and Coupled Changes in Innate and Adaptive Immune Gene Expression in
      Two Case-Control Studies of Blood Microarrays in Major Depressive Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral inflammation is often associated with major depressive
      disorder (MDD), and immunological biomarkers of depression remain a focus of
      investigation. METHODS: We used microarray data on whole blood from two
      independent case-control studies of MDD: the GlaxoSmithKline-High-Throughput
      Disease-specific target Identification Program [GSK-HiTDiP] study (113 patients
      and 57 healthy control subjects) and the Janssen-Brain Resource Company study (94
      patients and 100 control subjects). Genome-wide differential gene expression
      analysis (18,863 probes) resulted in a p value for each gene in each study. A
      Bayesian method identified the largest p-value threshold (q = .025) associated
      with twice the number of genes differentially expressed in both studies compared 
      with the number of coincidental case-control differences expected by chance.
      RESULTS: A total of 165 genes were differentially expressed in both studies with 
      concordant direction of fold change. The 90 genes overexpressed (or UP genes) in 
      MDD were significantly enriched for immune response to infection, were
      concentrated in a module of the gene coexpression network associated with innate 
      immunity, and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in monocytes,
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In contrast, the 75 genes
      underexpressed (or DOWN genes) in MDD were associated with the adaptive immune
      response and included clusters of genes with correlated expression in T cells,
      natural killer cells, and erythroblasts. Consistently, the MDD patients with
      overexpression of UP genes also had underexpression of DOWN genes (correlation > 
      .70 in both studies). CONCLUSIONS: MDD was replicably associated with
      proinflammatory activation of the peripheral innate immune system, coupled with
      relative inactivation of the adaptive immune system, indicating the potential of 
      transcriptional biomarkers for immunological stratification of patients with
      depression.

AB  - Studies over the last 20 years have demonstrated that increased inflammation and 
      hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are two of the
      most consistent biological findings in major depression and are often associated:
      but the molecular and clinical mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are
      still unclear. These findings are particularly enigmatic, especially considering 
      the accepted notion that high levels of cortisol have an anti-inflammatory
      action, and therefore the coexistence of inflammation and hypercortisolemia in
      the same diagnostic group appears counter-intuitive. To celebrate the 2015
      Anna-Monika Foundation Award to our laboratory, this review will discuss our own 
      20 years of research on the clinical and molecular evidence underlying the
      increased inflammation in depression, especially in the context of a hyperactive 
      HPA axis, and discuss its implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of this
      disorder.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicate a role for the immune system particularly
      inflammation and autoimmunity in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders
      such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we discuss some of the key
      advances in immunopsychiatry in order to highlight to psychiatrists and other
      health professionals how an increased understanding of this field might enhance
      our knowledge of illness mechanism and approaches to treatment. We present a
      brief overview of clinical research that link inflammation and autoimmunity with 
      depression and psychosis, including potential role of inflammation in treatment
      response, current evidence for the effectiveness of immune-modulating treatment
      for depression and psychosis, and possible role of inflammation in common
      physical comorbidities for these disorders such as coronary heart disease and
      diabetes mellitus. Gaining a better understanding of the role of immune system
      could be paradigm changing for psychiatry. We need collaborations between
      clinicians and scientists to deliver high-quality translational research in order
      to fully realise the clinical potential of this exciting and rapidly expanding
      field.
