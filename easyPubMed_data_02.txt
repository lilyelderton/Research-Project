AB  - Defining the organizational principles of neuronal networks at the cellular
      scale, or micro-connectomics, is a key challenge of modern neuroscience. In this 
      Review, we focus on graph theoretical parameters of micro-connectome topology,
      often informed by economical principles that conceptually originated with Ramon y
      Cajal's conservation laws. First, we summarize results from studies in intact
      small organisms and in samples from larger nervous systems. We then evaluate the 
      evidence for an economical trade-off between biological cost and functional value
      in the organization of neuronal networks. Various results suggest that many
      aspects of neuronal network organization are indeed the outcome of competition
      between these two fundamental selection pressures.

AB  - Most major psychiatric disorders arise from disturbances of anatomically
      distributed neural systems rather than isolated dysfunction of circumscribed
      brain regions. The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in our capacity to
      measure, map, and model neural connectivity in diverse species and at different
      resolution scales, from the level of individual neurons and synapses to
      large-scale systems spanning the entire brain. In this review, we consider how
      these techniques, when grounded in the theory and methods of network science, can
      contribute to a biological understanding of mental illness. We focus in
      particular on attempts to accurately map brain network disturbances in clinical
      populations and to model the mechanistic causes of these changes. This work
      suggests that pathology within highly connected hub regions is a consistent
      finding across a broad array of phenotypically diverse disorders, and that
      disparate changes in brain network organization can sometimes be explained by a
      surprisingly small and simple set of mechanisms.

AB  - Connectomics has focused primarily on the mapping of synaptic links in the brain;
      yet it is well established that extrasynaptic volume transmission, especially via
      monoamines and neuropeptides, is also critical to brain function and occurs
      primarily outside the synaptic connectome. We have mapped the putative monoamine 
      connections, as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections, in C. elegans based
      on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide
      networks exhibit distinct topological properties, with the monoamine network
      displaying a highly disassortative star-like structure with a rich-club of
      interconnected broadcasting hubs, and the neuropeptide network showing a more
      recurrent, highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between
      the extrasynaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes, we find
      highly significant multilink motifs of interaction, pinpointing locations in the 
      network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity.
      Thus, the C. elegans connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with
      synaptic, gap junction, and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes 
      of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for
      understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved
      by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or
      junctional circuits and extrasynaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small
      number of modulatory neurons.

AB  - It is nearly 20 years since the concept of a small-world network was first
      quantitatively defined, by a combination of high clustering and short path
      length; and about 10 years since this metric of complex network topology began to
      be widely applied to analysis of neuroimaging and other neuroscience data as part
      of the rapid growth of the new field of connectomics. Here, we review briefly the
      foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and generation of
      small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key developments in the field 
      in the past decade and we consider in some detail the implications of recent
      studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to map the anatomical
      networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw attention to the
      important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or
      unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain
      network analysis in the past, and the topology of weighted graphs, which retain
      more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the
      increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary 
      tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude by highlighting some
      possible future trends in the further development of weighted small-worldness as 
      part of a deeper and broader understanding of the topology and the functional
      value of the strong and weak links between areas of mammalian cortex.

TI  - Statistical Analysis of Tract-Tracing Experiments Demonstrates a Dense, Complex
      Cortical Network in the Mouse.
PG  - e1005104
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005104 [doi]
AB  - Anatomical tract tracing methods are the gold standard for estimating the weight 
      of axonal connectivity between a pair of pre-defined brain regions. Large
      studies, comprising hundreds of experiments, have become feasible by automated
      methods. However, this comes at the cost of positive-mean noise making it
      difficult to detect weak connections, which are of particular interest as recent 
      high resolution tract-tracing studies of the macaque have identified many more
      weak connections, adding up to greater connection density of cortical networks,
      than previously recognized. We propose a statistical framework that estimates
      connectivity weights and credibility intervals from multiple tract-tracing
      experiments. We model the observed signal as a log-normal distribution generated 
      by a combination of tracer fluorescence and positive-mean noise, also accounting 
      for injections into multiple regions. Using anterograde viral tract-tracing data 
      provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences, we estimate the connection
      density of the mouse intra-hemispheric cortical network to be 73% (95%
      credibility interval (CI): 71%, 75%); higher than previous estimates (40%).
      Inter-hemispheric density was estimated to be 59% (95% CI: 54%, 62%). The weakest
      estimable connections (about 6 orders of magnitude weaker than the strongest
      connections) are likely to represent only one or a few axons. These extremely
      weak connections are topologically more random and longer distance than the
      strongest connections, which are topologically more clustered and shorter
      distance (spatially clustered). Weak links do not substantially contribute to the
      global topology of a weighted brain graph, but incrementally increased
      topological integration of a binary graph. The topology of weak anatomical
      connections in the mouse brain, rigorously estimable down to the biological limit
      of a single axon between cortical areas in these data, suggests that they might
      confer functional advantages for integrative information processing and/or they
      might represent a stochastic factor in the development of the mouse connectome.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the potential of whole-brain computational models
      to provide mechanistic insights into resting-state brain networks. It is
      therefore important to determine the degree to which computational models
      reproduce the topological features of empirical functional brain networks. We
      used empirical connectivity data derived from diffusion spectrum and
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy
      individuals. Empirical and simulated functional networks, constrained by
      structural connectivity, were defined based on 66 brain anatomical regions
      (nodes). Simulated functional data were generated using the Kuramoto model in
      which each anatomical region acts as a phase oscillator. Network topology was
      studied using graph theory in the empirical and simulated data. The difference
      (relative error) between graph theory measures derived from empirical and
      simulated data was then estimated. We found that simulated data can be used with 
      confidence to model graph measures of global network organization at different
      dynamic states and highlight the sensitive dependence of the solutions obtained
      in simulated data on the specified connection densities. This study provides a
      method for the quantitative evaluation and external validation of graph theory
      metrics derived from simulated data that can be used to inform future study
      designs.

AB  - How does human brain structure mature during adolescence? We used MRI to measure 
      cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers
      aged 14-24 y old. We found and replicated that association cortical areas were
      thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 y. However,
      association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course 
      of adolescence. Age-related increases in cortical myelination were maximized
      approximately at the internal layer of projection neurons. Adolescent cortical
      myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a
      dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic,
      oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and
      biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of 
      shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same
      transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. We conclude that normative
      human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating 
      anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this
      consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral
      changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.

TI  - Default Mode Hypoconnectivity Underlies a Sex-Related Autism Spectrum.
PG  - 364-371
AB  - BACKGROUND: Females and males differ significantly in the prevalence and
      presentation of autism spectrum conditions. One theory of this effect postulates 
      that autistic traits lie on a sex-related continuum in the general population,
      and autism represents the extreme male end of this spectrum. This theory predicts
      that any feature of autism in males should 1) be present in autistic females, 2) 
      differentiate between the sexes in the typical population, and 3) correlate with 
      autistic traits. We tested these three predictions for default mode network (DMN)
      hypoconnectivity during the resting state, one of the most robustly found
      neurobiological differences in autism. METHODS: We analyzed a primary dataset of 
      adolescents (N = 121, 12-18 years of age) containing a relatively large number of
      females and a replication multisite dataset including children, adolescents, and 
      adults (N = 980, 6-58 years of age). We quantified the average connectivity
      between DMN regions and tested for group differences and correlation with
      behavioral performance using robust regression. RESULTS: We found significant
      differences in DMN intraconnectivity between female controls and females with
      autism (p = .001 in the primary dataset; p = .009 in the replication dataset),
      and between female controls and male controls (p = .036 in the primary dataset; p
      = .002 in the replication dataset). We also found a significant correlation
      between DMN intraconnectivity and performance on a mentalizing task (p = .001) in
      the primary dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings provide the first 
      evidence for DMN hypoconnectivity as a behaviorally relevant neuroimaging
      phenotype of the sex-related spectrum of autistic traits, of which autism
      represents the extreme case.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is a major public health problem that is particularly difficult
      to treat. Without medically proven pharmacological treatments, interventions to
      change the maladaptive behavior of addicted individuals mainly rely on
      psychosocial approaches. Here we report on impairments in cocaine-addicted
      patients to act purposefully toward a given goal and on the influence of extended
      training on their behavior. When patients were rewarded for their behavior,
      prolonged training improved their response rate toward the goal but
      simultaneously rendered them insensitive to the consequences of their actions. By
      contrast, overtraining of avoidance behavior had no effect on patient
      performance. Our findings illustrate the ineffectiveness of punitive approaches
      and highlight the potential for interventions that focus on improving
      goal-directed behavior and implementing more desirable habits to replace habitual
      drug-taking.

      Negative Symptoms of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia.
PG  - e0155631
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0155631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothetically, psychotic disorders could be caused or conditioned by
      immunological mechanisms. If so, one might expect there to be peripheral immune
      system phenotypes that are measurable in blood cells as biomarkers of psychotic
      states. METHODS: We used multi-parameter flow cytometry of venous blood to
      quantify and determine the activation state of 73 immune cell subsets for 18
      patients with chronic schizophrenia (17 treated with clozapine), and 18 healthy
      volunteers matched for age, sex, BMI and smoking. We used multivariate methods
      (partial least squares) to reduce dimensionality and define populations of
      differentially co-expressed cell counts in the cases compared to controls.
      RESULTS: Schizophrenia cases had increased relative numbers of NK cells, naive B 
      cells, CXCR5+ memory T cells and classical monocytes; and decreased numbers of
      dendritic cells (DC), HLA-DR+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and CD4+ memory T
      cells. Likewise, within the patient group, more severe negative and cognitive
      symptoms were associated with decreased relative numbers of dendritic cells,
      HLA-DR+ Tregs, and CD4+ memory T cells. Motivated by the importance of central
      nervous system dopamine signalling for psychosis, we measured dopamine receptor
      gene expression in separated CD4+ cells. Expression of the dopamine D3 (DRD3)
      receptor was significantly increased in clozapine-treated schizophrenia and
      covaried significantly with differentiated T cell classes in the CD4+ lineage.
      CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral immune cell populations and dopaminergic signalling are
      disrupted in clozapine-treated schizophrenia. Immuno-phenotypes may provide
      peripherally accessible and mechanistically specific biomarkers of residual
      cognitive and negative symptoms in this treatment-resistant subgroup of patients.

TI  - Absolute Measurements of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor and
      Interleukin-1-beta mRNA Levels Accurately Predict Treatment Response in Depressed
      Patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased levels of inflammation have been associated with a poorer
      response to antidepressants in several clinical samples, but these findings have 
      had been limited by low reproducibility of biomarker assays across laboratories, 
      difficulty in predicting response probability on an individual basis, and unclear
      molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Here we measured absolute mRNA values (a reliable 
      quantitation of number of molecules) of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor
      and interleukin-1beta in a previously published sample from a randomized
      controlled trial comparing escitalopram vs nortriptyline (GENDEP) as well as in
      an independent, naturalistic replication sample. We then used linear discriminant
      analysis to calculate mRNA values cutoffs that best discriminated between
      responders and nonresponders after 12 weeks of antidepressants. As Macrophage
      Migration Inhibitory Factor and interleukin-1beta might be involved in different 
      pathways, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network by the Search Tool
      for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. RESULTS: We identified cutoff
      values for the absolute mRNA measures that accurately predicted response
      probability on an individual basis, with positive predictive values and
      specificity for nonresponders of 100% in both samples (negative predictive
      value=82% to 85%, sensitivity=52% to 61%). Using network analysis, we identified 
      different clusters of targets for these 2 cytokines, with Macrophage Migration
      Inhibitory Factor interacting predominantly with pathways involved in
      neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and cell proliferation, and interleukin-1beta
      interacting predominantly with pathways involved in the inflammasome complex,
      oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: We believe that these data
      provide a clinically suitable approach to the personalization of antidepressant
      therapy: patients who have absolute mRNA values above the suggested cutoffs could
      be directed toward earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies,
      including the addition of other antidepressants or antiinflammatory drugs.

AB  - We introduce comparative connectomics, the quantitative study of cross-species
      commonalities and variations in brain network topology that aims to discover
      general principles of network architecture of nervous systems and the
      identification of species-specific features of brain connectivity. By comparing
      connectomes derived from simple to more advanced species, we identify two
      conserved themes of wiring: the tendency to organize network topology into
      communities that serve specialized functionality and the general drive to enable 
      high topological integration by means of investment of neural resources in short 
      communication paths, hubs, and rich clubs. Within the space of wiring
      possibilities that conform to these common principles, we argue that differences 
      in connectome organization between closely related species support adaptations in
      cognition and behavior.

PG  - 1651-60

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immune dysregulation is suggested to play an important aetiological
      role in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) potentially driving
      neurodevelopmental pathways. Immune dysfunction may precede the onset of
      psychiatric disorders and parallel the development of multiaxial comorbidity,
      including suicidal behaviour and metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Depicting
      the source of the chronic low-grade inflammatory component in SZ and BD is thus a
      research priority. Strong environmental insults early in life, such as
      infections, acting on a background of genetic vulnerability, may induce potent
      and enduring inflammatory responses setting a state of liability to second-hit
      environmental encounters, namely childhood trauma, drug abuse or additional
      infectious exposures. The immunogenetic background of susceptibility, suggested
      to be not only lying within the HLA locus but also implicating inherited deficits
      of the innate immune system, may amplify the harmful biological effects of
      infections/psychosocial stress leading to the manifestation of a broad range of
      psychiatric symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The present review aims to discuss the
      following: (i) biological arguments in favour of a chronic low-grade inflammation
      in SZ and BD and its potential origin in the interaction between the
      immunogenetic background and environmental infectious insults, and (ii) the
      consequences of this inflammatory dysfunction by focusing on N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor antibodies and activation of the family of human endogenous
      retroviruses (HERVs). CONCLUSIONS: Specific therapeutic approaches targeting
      immune pathways may lead the way to novel personalized medical interventions,
      improvement of quality of life and average life expectancy of psychiatric
      patients, if not even prevent mood episodes and psychotic symptoms.

TI  - Altered Hub Functioning and Compensatory Activations in the Connectome: A
      Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 434-42
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia have identified
      abnormal activations in many brain regions. In an effort to interpret these
      findings from a network perspective, we carried out a meta-analysis of this
      literature, mapping anatomical locations of under- and over-activation to the
      topology of a normative human functional connectome. METHODS: We included 314
      task-based functional neuroimaging studies including more than 5000 patients with
      schizophrenia and over 5000 controls. Coordinates of significant under- or
      over-activations in patients relative to controls were mapped to nodes of a
      normative connectome defined by a prior meta-analysis of 1641 functional
      neuroimaging studies of task-related activation in healthy volunteers. RESULTS:
      Under-activations and over-activations were reported in a wide diversity of brain
      regions. Both under- and over-activations were significantly more likely to be
      located in hub nodes that constitute the "rich club" or core of the normative
      connectome. In a subset of 121 studies that reported both under- and
      over-activations in the same patients, we found that, in network terms, these
      abnormalities were located in close topological proximity to each other.
      Under-activation in a peripheral node was more frequently associated specifically
      with over-activation of core nodes than with over-activation of another
      peripheral node. CONCLUSIONS: Although schizophrenia is associated with altered
      brain functional activation in a wide variety of regions, abnormal responses are 
      concentrated in hubs of the normative connectome. Task-specific under-activation 
      in schizophrenia is accompanied by over-activation of topologically central, less
      functionally specialized network nodes, which may represent a compensatory
      response.

AB  - Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable markers that may assist in the
      identification of the complex genetic underpinnings of psychiatric conditions.
      Here we examined global hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism spectrum
      conditions (ASCs). We studied well-matched groups of adolescent males with
      autism, genetically-related siblings of individuals with autism, and
      typically-developing control participants. We parcellated the brain into 258
      regions and used complex-network analysis to detect a robust hypoconnectivity
      endophenotype in our participant group. We observed that whole-brain functional
      connectivity was highest in controls, intermediate in siblings, and lowest in
      ASC, in task and rest conditions. We identified additional, local endophenotype
      effects in specific networks including the visual processing and default mode
      networks. Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional
      hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence, and may thus
      underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their
      relatives.

TI  - Randomization and resilience of brain functional networks as systems-level
      endophenotypes of schizophrenia.
PG  - 9123-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1502052112 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is increasingly conceived as a disorder of brain network
      organization or dysconnectivity syndrome. Functional MRI (fMRI) networks in
      schizophrenia have been characterized by abnormally random topology. We tested
      the hypothesis that network randomization is an endophenotype of schizophrenia
      and therefore evident also in nonpsychotic relatives of patients. Head
      movement-corrected, resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 25 patients with
      schizophrenia, 25 first-degree relatives of patients, and 29 healthy volunteers. 
      Graphs were used to model functional connectivity as a set of edges between
      regional nodes. We estimated the topological efficiency, clustering, degree
      distribution, resilience, and connection distance (in millimeters) of each
      functional network. The schizophrenic group demonstrated significant
      randomization of global network metrics (reduced clustering, greater efficiency),
      a shift in the degree distribution to a more homogeneous form (fewer hubs), a
      shift in the distance distribution (proportionally more long-distance edges), and
      greater resilience to targeted attack on network hubs. The networks of the
      relatives also demonstrated abnormal randomization and resilience compared with
      healthy volunteers, but they were typically less topologically abnormal than the 
      patients' networks and did not have abnormal connection distances. We conclude
      that schizophrenia is associated with replicable and convergent evidence for
      functional network randomization, and a similar topological profile was evident
      also in nonpsychotic relatives, suggesting that this is a systems-level
      endophenotype or marker of familial risk. We speculate that the greater
      resilience of brain networks may confer some fitness advantages on nonpsychotic
      relatives that could explain persistence of this endophenotype in the population.

AB  - Connectome mapping using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) has become a focus of systems neuroscience. There remain many statistical 
      challenges in analysis of functional connectivity and network architecture from
      BOLD fMRI multivariate time series. One key statistic for any time series is its 
      (effective) degrees of freedom, df, which will generally be less than the number 
      of time points (or nominal degrees of freedom, N). If we know the df, then
      probabilistic inference on other fMRI statistics, such as the correlation between
      two voxel or regional time series, is feasible. However, we currently lack good
      estimators of df in fMRI time series, especially after the degrees of freedom of 
      the "raw" data have been modified substantially by denoising algorithms for head 
      movement. Here, we used a wavelet-based method both to denoise fMRI data and to
      estimate the (effective) df of the denoised process. We show that seed voxel
      correlations corrected for locally variable df could be tested for false positive
      connectivity with better control over Type I error and greater specificity of
      anatomical mapping than probabilistic connectivity maps using the nominal degrees
      of freedom. We also show that wavelet despiked statistics can be used to estimate
      all pairwise correlations between a set of regional nodes, assign a P value to
      each edge, and then iteratively add edges to the graph in order of increasing P. 
      These probabilistically thresholded graphs are likely more robust to regional
      variation in head movement effects than comparable graphs constructed by
      thresholding correlations. Finally, we show that time-windowed estimates of df
      can be used for probabilistic connectivity testing or dynamic network analysis so
      that apparent changes in the functional connectome are appropriately corrected
      for the effects of transient noise bursts. Wavelet despiking is both an algorithm
      for fMRI time series denoising and an estimator of the (effective) df of denoised
      fMRI time series. Accurate estimation of df offers many potential advantages for 
      probabilistically thresholding functional connectivity and network statistics
      tested in the context of spatially variant and non-stationary noise. Code for
      wavelet despiking, seed correlational testing and probabilistic graph
      construction is freely available to download as part of the BrainWavelet Toolbox 
      at www.brainwavelet.org.

AB  - The dedifferentiation theory of aging proposes that a reduction in the
      specificity of neural representations causes declines in complex cognition as
      people get older, and may reflect a reduction in dopaminergic signaling. The
      present pharmacological fMRI study investigated episodic memory-related
      dedifferentiation in young and older adults, and its relation to dopaminergic
      function, using a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design
      with the agonist Bromocriptine (1.25mg) and the antagonist Sulpiride (400mg). We 
      used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure memory specificity: the degree to
      which distributed patterns of activity distinguishing two different task contexts
      during an encoding phase are reinstated during memory retrieval. As predicted,
      memory specificity was reduced in older adults in prefrontal cortex and in
      hippocampus, consistent with an impact of neural dedifferentiation on episodic
      memory representations. There was also a linear age-dependent dopaminergic
      modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus reflecting a relative boost to
      memory specificity on Bromocriptine in older adults whose memory was poorer at
      baseline, and a relative boost on Sulpiride in older better performers, compared 
      to the young. This differed from generalized effects of both agents on task
      specificity in the encoding phase. The results demonstrate a link between aging, 
      dopaminergic function and dedifferentiation in the hippocampus.

AB  - The study of spontaneous brain activity using fMRI is central to mapping brain
      networks. However, current fMRI methodology has limitations in the study of small
      animal brain organization using ultra-high field fMRI experiments, as imaging
      artifacts are difficult to control and the relationship between classical
      neuroanatomy and spontaneous functional BOLD activity is not fully established.
      Challenges are especially prevalent during the fMRI study of individual rodent
      brains, which could be instrumental to studies of disease progression and
      pharmacology. A recent advance in fMRI methodology enables unbiased, accurate,
      and comprehensive identification of functional BOLD signals by interfacing
      multi-echo (ME) fMRI acquisition, NMR signal decay analysis, and independent
      components analysis (ICA), in a procedure called ME-ICA. Here we present a pilot 
      study on the suitability of ME-ICA for ultra high field animal fMRI studies of
      spontaneous brain activity under anesthesia. ME-ICA applied to 11.7 T fMRI data
      of rats first showed robust performance in automatic high dimensionality
      estimation and ICA decomposition, similar to that previously reported for 3.0 T
      human data. ME sequence optimization for 11.7 T indicated that 3 echoes, 0.5mm
      isotropic voxel size and TR=3s was adequate for sensitive and specific BOLD
      signal acquisition. Next, in seeking optimal inhaled isoflurane anesthesia
      dosage, we report that progressive increase in anesthesia goes with concomitant
      decrease in statistical complexity of "global" functional activity, as measured
      by the number of BOLD components, or degrees of freedom (DOF). Finally, BOLD
      functional connectivity maps for individual rodents at the component level show
      that spontaneous BOLD activity follows classical neuroanatomy, and seed-based
      analysis shows plausible cortical-cortical and cortical-subcortical functional
      interactions.

TI  - The hubs of the human connectome are generally implicated in the anatomy of brain
      disorders.

AB  - Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly connected hub nodes 
      that are functionally valuable, because their topological centrality supports
      integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that 
      hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other
      brain regions, and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming
      that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological
      cost, we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub
      regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first identified the hubs of brain
      anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy
      volunteers (n = 56), and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs
      disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random
      attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps, based on meta-analyses of
      published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26
      different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common
      across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal
      brain connectome (P < 10(-4), permutation test). Specifically, nine brain
      disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs
      (P < 0.05, permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
      Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions,
      although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in
      each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion
      probability in Alzheimer's disease, whereas in schizophrenia lesions were
      concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking
      pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal
      diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were
      defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional
      neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional
      co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human
      brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many 
      (if not all) brain disorders.

AB  - In recent years, pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from
      an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to
      characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has
      paralleled rapid advances in connectomics, a field concerned with comprehensively
      mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts, as
      it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale
      architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper, we provide a brief
      introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent
      developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain
      disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
      Specifically, we consider how research into circuit-level, connectome-wide and
      topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological
      theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings
      highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of
      disturbances in an interconnected complex system, rather than discrete pathology 
      in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain connectivity and altered
      neurodevelopmental processes. Cross-sectional case-control studies in different
      age groups have suggested that deficits in cortical thickness in childhood-onset 
      schizophrenia may normalize over time, suggesting a disorder-related difference
      in cortical growth trajectories. METHODS: We acquired magnetic resonance imaging 
      scans repeated over several years for each subject, in a sample of 106 patients
      with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 102 age-matched healthy volunteers. Using 
      semiparametric regression, we modeled the effect of schizophrenia on the growth
      curve of cortical thickness in ~80,000 locations across the cortex, in the age
      range 8 to 30 years. In addition, we derived normative developmental modules
      composed of cortical regions with similar maturational trajectories for cortical 
      thickness in typical brain development. RESULTS: We found abnormal nonlinear
      growth processes in prefrontal and temporal areas that have previously been
      implicated in schizophrenia, distinguishing for the first time between cortical
      areas with age-constant deficits in cortical thickness and areas whose
      maturational trajectories are altered in schizophrenia. In addition, we showed
      that when the brain is divided into five normative developmental modules, the
      areas with abnormal cortical growth overlap significantly only with the
      cingulo-fronto-temporal module. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abnormal
      cortical development in schizophrenia may be modularized or constrained by the
      normal community structure of developmental modules of the human brain
      connectome.

TI  - Obstetric complications and autoantibodies in schizophrenia.
PG  - 270-3
AB  - Our hypothesis stated that patients with schizophrenia who had obstetric
      complications (OC) were more likely to have autoimmune abnormalities than those
      without OC. OC were rated using a checklist. Anti-brain autoantibodies were
      measured in serum using an enzyme immunoassay. Autoantibodies to non-CNS tissues 
      were detected using serological procedures. There were no significant differences
      between the groups with respect to anti-brain antibodies, but patients with OC (n
      = 24) had a significantly higher prevalence of autoantibodies to non-CNS tissues 
      than patients without OC (n = 25). Both groups were receiving neuroleptic drugs. 
      OC may contribute to autoimmune abnormalities among patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Differences in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) between healthy dextral and non-dextral
      subjects.
PG  - 185-8
AB  - Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured in picograms/ml pg/ml using an
      immunoassay (ELISA) in healthy individuals (n = 148), of whom 128 were classified
      as dextral and 20 as non-dextral, as per a laterality questionnaire. Only 3 (15%)
      non-dextral individuals had serum IL-6 levels above the lower limit of the assay 
      sensitivity as compared to 59 (46%) of dextral individuals (P < 0.013). There
      were no significant correlations between previously determined mitogen stimulated
      interleukin-2 production and autoantibodies in a subset of the same individuals. 
      While this data does not provide casual information, it adds to the evidence of
      the asymmetric regulation of immune functions by the cerebral hemispheres.

TI  - Immune abnormalities in schizophrenia: evidence for the autoimmune hypothesis.
PG  - 70-83
AB  - The autoimmune basis for schizophrenia has been investigated for the last 60
      years. Although numerous immune abnormalities have been reported, the current
      literature is viewed with much skepticism because most of the studies have failed
      to control for extraneous factors that may have influenced the findings.
      Principally, antipsychotic medication, duration of illness, and current clinical 
      state (acutely psychotic or remitted) may considerably alter immune response, as 
      may other factors such as nutritional status, substance abuse, and concurrent
      medical illness. We review recent studies that employed current diagnostic
      criteria and modern immunologic techniques. (These studies were located by use of
      a Medline search on the terms schizophrenia and psychosis, cross-referenced with 
      immune abnormalities, lymphokines, antibodies, lymphocytes, HLA, and medication, 
      and by perusing the reference lists in the articles found through this search.)
      Immune abnormalities that have been replicated in studies of schizophrenic
      patients include increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, decreased
      production of interleukin-2, and increased serum concentrations of interleukin-2 
      receptor and interleukin-6. Given the current importance of autoimmunity as an
      etiologic mechanism in several branches of medicine, further studies are needed, 
      especially those having a longitudinal design and including drug-naive patients.

TI  - An association between anti-hippocampal antibody concentration and lymphocyte
      production of IL-2 in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 449-55
AB  - Serum concentrations of anti-hippocampal antibodies and in vitro production of
      the lymphokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)
      stimulation were determined using an enzyme immunoassay in 49 schizophrenic
      patients and 41 healthy controls. Decrease in IL-2 production, a finding
      frequently associated with many autoimmune diseases, was associated with an
      elevation in anti-hippocampal antibody optical density (AHA-OD) in schizophrenic 
      patients. Although some control subjects had elevated antibody levels, this
      elevation was not associated with decreased IL-2 production. Low IL-2 production 
      is well known to be a state marker associated with active autoimmune disease. We 
      suggest that production of hippocampal antibody is a trait marker of
      vulnerability to autoimmune diseases. Thus, our finding of low IL-2 production in
      patients with high concentrations of hippocampal antibody is compatible with the 
      possibility that such patients have an ongoing autoimmune process.

TI  - The prevalence of autoantibodies among right and left handed schizophrenic
      patients and control subjects.
PG  - 803-11
AB  - Sera from schizophrenic patients (n = 186) and healthy control subjects (n = 346)
      were tested for the presence of seven common autoantibodies by standard
      immunological methods. The association between handedness and autoantibodies was 
      tested in a multi-way contingency table using a log-linear model. For men, but
      not women, nondextrals (patients and controls) were twice as likely to test
      positive for autoantibodies than dextrals (p = 0.0002). Although more women (33%)
      than men (24%) tested positive for autoantibodies, handedness was not a
      distinguishing factor among women. These data suggest that sinistrality and
      gender are associated with autoantibodies in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients
      and healthy control subjects.
